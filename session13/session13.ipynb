       "     'bodyText': 'Rishi Sunak has said “there’s nothing tetchy” about him and dismissed dissent among his MPs to the Rwanda bill as “debating society” behaviour. In an interview with the Spectator, the prime minister also said that his Christmas reading would be Jilly Cooper’s latest novel Tackle!, whose tagline is “if you want to score, you’ve got to be a player”. Sunak has been accused of being “tetchy”, particularly when he comes under pressure by the media but when asked about this by the Spectator’s Katy Balls, he said: “‘I don’t understand that,” later adding: “I am fighting for the things I believe in. There’s nothing tetchy. But I am passionate.” The interview comes as Sunak’s party is riven by in-fighting while he attempts to push through legislation to send people seeking asylum in the UK to Rwanda. Centrist Tories are considering tabling amendments to the Rwanda bill to protect the controversial legislation against breaches of international law. Meanwhile, right-wing Conservatives have threatened to vote it down unless more draconian measures, such as denying asylum seekers individual appeals, are added. Sunak would not commit to a timeline for when flights to Kigali would take off if he steered the legislation through the Commons and Lords, saying only that he was “keen to crack on with it”. In a nod to his party’s civil war over the policy, he said: “What the country wants is a practical government that is making a difference to their lives and changing things for the better, not a debating society. “People are frustrated that the pace of change is not fast enough. I get that. I am working night and day, tirelessly, to keep making a difference.” The prime minister also said Rwanda would not accept deportees who had no legal recourse to Strasbourg. Sunak said he did not regret using the slogan “stop the boats” to campaign for re-election. Small boat crossings have continued and it has been criticised for dehumanising refugees. The prime minister said: “No, I think it’s a straightforward phrase. Everyone knows what I wanted to do. I do ultimately want to stop the boats, because there isn’t an acceptable amount of illegal migration.” He added: “If someone had said to me, ‘You are going to have reduced the number of small boat arrivals into this country by a third’, after they had quadrupled in the last few years ... I think someone would have said: ‘What are you smoking?’” Painting himself as an heir to Thatcher on tax, he said: “I have always said I’m a Thatcherite in the truest sense. As Nigel Lawson and Margaret Thatcher said: cut inflation, cut taxes. That’s what we’ve done! We have delivered more tax cuts in one fiscal event than at any point since the 1980s.” Sunak said he was making progress in the job and insisted he was enjoying it, despite a vast opinion poll deficit and managing a warring party. “Of course, it’s hard. I knew it was going to be,” he said. “I feel that I’m making progress so I can sit here and say: do you know what? Of all the things I said I would do, I’ve made progress. And that is fulfilling.’”'},\n",

       "    'fields': {'headline': 'Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer clash over homelessness and the UK economy at PMQs – as it happened',\n",
       "     'bodyText': \"The UK “isn’t being governed” as the Conservative party fights among itself, Keir Starmer has told Rishi Sunak at the last prime minister’s questions of the year, challenging him in particular on rates of homelessness. Mark Drakeford has announced he is stepping down as the Welsh first minister and a contest for the leadership of Welsh Labour will begin shortly. Britain’s economy shrank unexpectedly by 0.3% in October as households and businesses came under growing pressure amid the cost of living crisis, raising the chances of a recession. The BBC is likely to be “looking into” Gary Lineker’s criticism of Conservative politicians, which appear to breach the BBC’s social media guidelines, Samir Shah, the government’s proposed new chair of the corporation, has said. As the home affairs committee hearing was ending, Diana Johnson, the committee chair, asked about the amount of money spent on the Rwanda scheme. At the end of last week, the Home Office revealed that in addition to the initial £140m spent on the scheme, another £100m was paid in April and £50m is due to be paid next year. In the Commons yesterday, Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, claimed, on the basis of an answer from James Cleverly, that he was admitting a further £100m would be spent in future years. But Michael Tomlinson, the minister for illegal migration, told Johnson he could just confirm the £100m paid this year and the £50m due to be paid next year. He said information about further payments in the future would be released in due course. Tom Pursglove, the minister for legal migration, is now being asked about the changes to family visa rules. (See 1.38pm.) Tim Loughton (Con) says James Cleverly, the home secretary, gave an interview saying the new rules would not be retrospectively applied. Is that correct? Pursglove says applications already lodged will be treated under the rules as they are now. And the Home Office does not intend to apply the rules retrospectively. Q: So my constituent reapplying for a visa won’t have to meet the new threshold? And what happens when they have to reapply again in future. Pursglove says, in the first case, the new rules will not apply. And, going ahead, he says rules will not be applied through a retrospective prism. Loughton says he thinks Pursglove is saying that, for people with visas already, not just the first renewal, but all subsequent renewals will be under the old salary threshold, not the new one. Is that right? Pursglove says he needs to be allowed to make the announcement in the proper way. But, with a bit of nodding of his head, he seems to reassure Loughton that his understanding is correct. The Rycroft letter also includes this charts showing the number of people arriving in the UK since 2020 who have been returned home, divided into Albanians and non-Albanians, and FNOs (foreign national offenders) and non-FNOs. Rycroft supplied the information because he could not provide the figures when he was at the committee last month and Lee Anderson, the Tory party deputy chair, asked what the numbers were. The chart shows that only 420 non-Albanians have been sent back. Diana Johnson, the home affairs committee chair, told the committee earlier that the Home Office has said it has spent £22m on the Bibby Stockholm. (See 3.21pm.) The letter from Sir Matthew Rycroft, the permanent secretary, which she was quoting, makes it clear that this figure (£22,450,772, to be precise) only covers the “vessel accommodation services” part of the contract. The home affairs committee has now published the latest letter it has received from Sir Matthew Rycroft, permanent secretary at the Home Office. Diana Johnson, the chair, has been referring to it during the hearing. Back at the home affairs committee, the MPs were told that 132 of the 154 unaccompanied child asylum seekers who went missing from hotel accommodation were still missing. Alison Thewliss (SNP) said this implied the Home Office did not care. If her children were missing, she would want to know where they were. Tom Pursglove, the minister for legal migration, objected strongly. He said he and others at the Home Office did care about what has happened to these children. Michael Gove will next week announce a relaxation of housing targets for local authorities in England, which developers worry will mean far fewer homes being built amid a housing crisis, Kiran Stacey reports. James Daly (Con) is asking the questions. Q: Under the Rwanda bill, it is possible for a UK minister to ignore an interim injunction saying a deportation cannot go ahead? Michael Tomlinson, the minister for illegal migration, says the PM has made it clear that he will not let a foreign court stop a flight leaving. And he says the bill makes it clear that decisons about what should happen are for a UK minister. Diana Johnson says the Home Office has revealed that it is spending £22m on the Bibby Stockholm barge. Q: How long is that for? Pursglove says he does not have that figure. Johnson says the Home Office could not give a value-for-money assessment, saying what that per person cost was. Pursglove says the value for money assessment is being updated. He says this is a more cost-effective way of providing accommodation. Q: How do you know? Pursglove says they are still looking at the figures. UPDATE: The letter from Sir Matthew Rycroft, the permanent secretary, which Johnson was quoting, makes it clear that the £22m figure (£22,450,772, to be precise) only covers the “vessel accommodation services” part of the contract. At the home affairs committee Diana Johnson, the committee chair, is now having a row with Michael Tomlinson, the minister for illegal migration. She says Tomlinson and his colleagues are being “incredibly disrespectful” in coming to the committee without answers. Lee Anderson, the Tory deputy chair and a member of the committee, is now asking questions. He also accuses the Home Office team of being “disrespectful”. He asks if Sir Matthew Rycroft, the permanent secretary, and Simon Ridley, the interim second permanent secretary, have got into trouble over how badly prepared they were when they attended the committee last month. Tomlinson says a follow-up letter has been sent. But if Anderson has not had a satisfactory answer yet, he should get one. Q: Do you keep a weekly or monthly total of how many people have been returned? Is that a good idea? Tomlinson says he thinks that would be a good idea. Q: What good does it do clearing the asylum application backlog? Does that just lead to people claiming support from councils? Pursglove says it is helpful to clear the backlog. That means asylum seekers can be removed from hotels. Q: You have sent us figures saying only 420 non-Albanians have been returned since 2020. Is that acceptable? Tomlinson says he wants that figure to be much higher. Q: Do you support having ID cards? Tomlinson says he is cautious about those proposals. Back at the home affairs committee Tim Loughton (Con) asked about an exchange the committee had with Sir Matthew Rycroft, the permanent secretary at the Home Office, last month when Rycroft could not explain what had happened to 17,000 people whose asylum applications had been withdrawn. Dan Hobbs, director general for migration and borders at the Home Office, who is giving evidence with Tomlinson and Pursglove, said he still did not know where these people were. He said officials were still compiling the data. Loughton said he was surprised that, two weeks later, the Home Office still did not have the information. Diana Johnson, the committee chair, said she agreed. The Foreign Office has announced sanctions on seven further individuals linked to Hamas. David Cameron, the foreign secretary, said: Hamas can have no future in Gaza. Today’s sanctions on Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad will continue to cut off their access to funding and isolate them further. We will continue to work with partners to reach a long-term political solution so that Israelis and Palestinians can live in peace. Diana Johnson, the chair of the home affairs committee, asks about information the committee has had from the Home Office. She says the figures show that the percentage of asylum claims approved went from 38% in the second quarter of this year to 67% in the third quarter. The government is committed to clearling the so-called legacy backlog of applications – those dating from before June 2022, when the Nationality and Borders Act came into force – by the end of this year. Pursglove cannot give Johnson a clear explanation but he says he expects the approval rate to fall again in the final quarter of the year. Michael Tomlinson, the minister for illegal migration, and Tom Pursglove, the minister for legal migration, have just started giving evidence to the Commons home affairs committee. There is a live feed here. James Cleverly, the home secretary, is often described at Westminster as a friendly guy, and he has paid a warm tribute to Mark Drakeford, who has announced today that he will stand down as Labour leader in Wales and Welsh first minister before Easter next year. Cleverly posted this on X: I never really worked closely with Mark Drakeford, but on the times we did meet and talk I always found him to be a real gent. Thank you for your public service, and all the best for the future. But Cleverly’s colleagues at CCHQ were not feeling so charitable this morning. They sent out a press release with a quote from Richard Holden, the Tory chair, saying: We thank Mark Drakeford for his service, but Labour’s 25 years of failure running Wales cannot be ignored … With falling schools standards, blanket 20mph speed limits, and blocking meal deals in supermarkets, the Labour government in Wales have been focused on short-term soundbites. Many Labour figures have been paying tribute. Steven Morris quotes some of them in his story about Drakeford standing down, and here are some more. From Keir Starmer: From Gordon Brown, the former Labour PM: Mark Drakeford has been a brilliant, compassionate and principled leader of Welsh Labour putting social justice right at the top of his mission. He deserves all our gratitude for his years of public service. From Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader and shadow secretary for climate change and net zero: From Kevin Brennan, the Cardiff West MP and shadow minister for victims: SNP leaders have paid tribute too. From Nicola Sturgeon, the former Scottish first minister: Sending my very best wishes to @MarkDrakeford. He was without doubt one of the most decent, dedicated, principled, and impressive politicians I had the privilege of working with in my time as FM. He will be the hardest of acts to follow. From Humza Yousaf, the Scottish first minister: My thanks to @MarkDrakeford, a dedicated and principled public servant. A Labour politician willing to call out the damage of Brexit and stand up to Westminster austerity. An ally in defending devolution from repeated Westminster attacks. I wish him all the best for the future At the post-PMQs Downing Street lobby briefing, the PM’s spokesperson did not deny reports saying MPs will not be asked to debate the remaining stages of the Rwanda bill until the week starting Monday 15 January. Asked about that potential timetable, the spokesperson replied: We haven’t set out the timetable for that, so that is speculation as it stands. It is important that we do get this legislation passed. Many families were shocked last week when the government announced a huge increase in the income threshold for anyone sponsoring a family visa. The new rules should mean that any Briton earning less than £38,700 will probably not be allowed to bring a foreign spouse to the UK. During PMQs Stephen Timms, the Labour MP who chairs the work and pensions committee, said the marriage plans of thousands of couples were scuppered by these rules. He asked if families already in the UK would be exempt when their visas were renewed, or whether any transitional exemptions might be in place. In his reply, Rishi Sunak implied the rules would be introduced gradually. He said: We have a longstanding principle that anyone bringing dependants to the UK must be able to support them financially – we should not expect this to be at the taxpayer’s expense and the threshold hasn’t been raised in over a decade, it is right that we have now brought it in line with the median salary. The family immigration route as he knows does contain provision for exceptional circumstances, but more generally it’s also right, and I can tell him, to look at transitional arrangements to ensure that they are fair and the Home Office are actively looking at this and will set out further information shortly. In his memoir Politics on the Edge, the former cabinet minister turned podcaster Rory Stewart says: “Nine years in politics had been a shocking education in lack of seriousness.” PMQs often shows why this is such a compelling critique of Westminster, but rarely more than today. It’s the last PMQs before Christmas and so an element of end-of-term cheer was understandable, and expected. But the opening of the sesssion today was just bizarre. First, Rishi Sunak was cheered to the rafters by his MPs as if he were Churchill at the end of WW2, rather than a PM who had just managed to win a vote by postponing the big policy argument until the start of the next year. Then, after a question about contaminated blood, he took a question from a Tory who seemed to think that the reason the tax burden is so high is all because of the economic modelling methodology used by the OBR. Sunak leaned into this enthusiastically, and started boasting about introducing the biggest tax cuts for a generation. Regular readers – and, indeed, any half-intelligent person who follows current affairs reasonably diligently – will of course know that the tax burden is approaching a postwar high. Keir Starmer did not indulge Sunak’s denialism, but he did start off in festive, jokey mode and made some reasonably good gags about Tory disunity. This created a problem when, in his third question, he moved on to problems with the economy and public services. Sunak was able to hit back effectively with the line: “He talks about governing and he spent the first two questions talking about political tittle-tattle, what a joke.” But Starmer then steered the conversation to homelessness, and he had a good jibe about the pomposity of the European Research Group. Nearly 140,000 children are going to be homeless this Christmas, that is more than ever before, that is a shocking state of affairs and it should shame this government. Instead of more social housing, housebuilding is set to collapse. Instead of banning no-fault evictions, thousands of families are at risk of homelessness. Rather than indulge in his backbenchers swanning around in their factions and their star chambers pretending to be members of the mafia, when is he going to get a grip and focus on the country? Sunak’s response was managerial (“tone-deaf”, Starmer called it), but it was in the next exchange where he came unstuck. A good rule in the Commons is that a reply should always match the tone of the question put, which means that sombre\/emotive\/non-partisan needs a response in kind. Starmer started talking about named families and individuals affected by homelessness and asked Sunak about an 11-year-old boy whose letter to Santa requested a forever home, and no new toys, “just my old toys out of storage”. It was heartbreaking. There was no easy reply available to Sunak, but he should at least have engaged emotionally. Instead, he just started hammering away about a vote in the Lords. This time he really was tone-deaf. Here is the clip. It was hard to tell whether the trap was deliberate or fortuitous – but Sunak fell into it all the same. Chris Bryant (Lab) asks what’s worse: losing WhatsApp messages as a tech bro; losing £11bn to fraud as chancellor; presiding over the biggest fall in living standards; or desperately clinging to power when your time is up? Sunak says he is delivering for the British people. Daniel Kawczynski (Con) asks for money to help tackle flooding by the River Severn. Sunak says the government will consider this. Mary Glindon (Lab) says the Home Office has put out a contract to manage small boat arrivals until 2030. Doesn’t that show even the Home Office does not think the Rwanda plan will work. Sunak says that is a mischaracterisation of what is happening. John Spellar (Lab) says people think Britain isn’t working. When will Sunak get a grip? Sunak says the cost of living is the most pressing issue for families, and the government has halved inflation. And it is cutting taxes too, he says. James Morris (Con) says the Tories made a manifesto commitment in 2017 and 2019 to reform the Mental Health Act. People with autism are being kept in inappropriate accommodation for long periods, he says. There was no bill in the king’s speech. So will the PM meet MPs to discuss? Sunak says the government does want to bring forward a bill when time allows. Marsha de Cordova (Lab) asks about families who are cold and hungry at Christmas Sunak says the government cares deeply about poor families. He lists some of the welfare measures put in place. Jerome Mayhew (Con) asks Sunak if he agrees that a dentist who accepts NHS funding should continue with the NHS before going private. Sunak says he agrees. A dentistry recovery plan will be published in due course. Cat Smith (Lab) says a rogue company has walked away from hazardous waste in Lancaster. The council has had to pick up the tab for dealing with this. It could burn for months. Will the government help it? Sunak says Lancaster city council and other bodies are dealing with this. He will ensure that the relevant minister understands the urgency of this, he says. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader at Westminster, asks if the government will amend the Internal Market Act to guarantee Northern Ireland has full access to the British market. Sunak says he accepts more needs to be done. He says the government is ready to legislate to protect Northern Ireland’s place in the UK internal market, alongside moves to restore power sharing at Stormont. This implies a deal is close to changing the way the Northern Ireland protocol works, to address DUP concerns and get it to lift its boycott of Stormont. Whether this would involve significant changes to trading rules, or just cosmetic ones, is not clear from these exchanges. Neil Hudson (Con) asks about youth travel. Will the government mandate councils to provide post-16 transport for students who need to travel to college? Sunak says no child should be prevented from accessing education by lack of transport. Stephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster, asks Sunak what his message is for children in Gaza. Sunak says no one wants to see the fighting go on. He says he wants a sustainable ceasefire, which would not allow Hamas to continue bombing Israel. Flynn says it is shameful that the UK abstained in the UN vote, and why the 153 nations calling for a ceasefire were wrong. Sunak says too many people have lost their lives. He says he has made this point to the Israeli PM. Stephen Hammond (Con) asks Sunak to consider what he says are unfair VAT rules for on-street electric charging. Sunak claims the government is on track to reach its charge points target. He says the government is reviewing guidance on this. Starmer says, cooconed in No 10, Sunak is oblivious to what is happening. He ends wishing everyone a happy and peaceful new year. He asks the PM to join him. Sunak says Starmer missed what he said at the start. He says the government is supporting working families. But Labour is just offering more borrowing, he says. The costs of net zero have been cut, inflation has been cut, and small boat crossings are down by a third, he says. Starmer says children in homeless families are at a record high. He asks about a child homeless at Christmas, who wrote a letter saying he did not want new toys, just his old toys out of storage. Sunak says, if Starmer cared about building homes, Labour would not have voted against the move to get rid of nutrient neutrality rules. Starmer says, rather than indulging his backbenchers “pretending to be the mafia”, Sunak should be governing the country. Sunak says the government has delivered a record number of new homes. Starmer says there is an economy that is not being governed. Wouldn’t the government be better of fixing the problems it has caused instead of creating new ones. Sunak says Starmer talks about issues, but has devoted his first two questions to Westminster tittle tattle. He says education standars are rising, but not in Labour-run Wales. Starmer says everyone can see the Tories are in meltdown. His MPs have criticised him as inexperienced, arrogant, a really bad politicians. He asks Tory MPs to put their hands up if the comments came from them. And who said '“he’s got to go”. He says Sunak is holding a Christmas party next week. How’s the invite list looking? Sunak says Starmer “should hear what they have to say about him”. The shouting is very loud, and Sir Lindsay Hoyle tells MPs to be less noisy. Keir Starmer mentions the death of an asylum seeker on the Bibby Stockholm. We must never let that happen again. And he says Mark Drakeford has been a titan of public service. Christmas is a time of peace on earth and goodwill to all. Has anyone told the Tory party? Sunak says Christmas is also a time for families, and under the Conservatives “we do have a record number of them”, he says (a reference to the so-called “five families”.) Greg Smith (Con) says the OBR is habitually wong. Will the govenrment get a better system of modelling so we can have lower taxes? Sunak says the OBR has to produce an assessment of its accuracy. The government has delivered the largest tax cuts for a generation, he says. Mike Kane (Lab) asks about a constituent who is 74 and a victim of the contaminated blood scandal. When will he be compensated? Sunak says this was an appalling tragedy. The government set up the inquiry, and has accepted the moral case for compensation. A Cabinet Office minister will reveal the next steps shortly. Rishi Sunak is loudly cheered by his backbenchers as he stands up. He starts by wishing people a happy new year, and thanks the armed forces, particularly those working abroad, and members of the emergency services. And he pays tribute to Mark Drakeford. Rishi Sunak is about to take PMQs. It will be the last of 2023. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. Mark Drakeford has announced he is stepping down as the Welsh first minister with immediate effect and a leadership contest will take place, Steven Morris reports. A reader asks: We have heard about the government having a working majority of 56, but what is their effective majority, given that there are several complicating factors? There are a number of Conservative members who have had the whip withdrawn, but might be expected to support the government on this issue; there is one Conservative MP who has been told not to attend; and Sinn Fein are included in the totals but never attend. It seems that these factors mean that there would need to be more than 29 rebels to defeat the government. The figure 56, for the size of the government’s working majority, comes from the table on the House of Commons website. It makes allowance for the fact that the speaker and deputy speakers, by convention, do not vote, and for the fact that the seven Sinn Féin MPs do not vote because they have not taken their seats. But this figure reflects what the government’s majority would be if all remaining Conservative MPs voted on one side, and all the other MPs in the Commons voted on the other side. But those other MPs include 18 MPs are now classed as independent because they have had the whip withdrawn. They don’t operate as a group, but if they did they would be able to outvote the Lib Dems (who have 15 MPs). Of those 18, seven were elected as Conservative MPs. Some have hopes of having the whip restored, and are minded to be helpful to No 10; some don’t. But, instinctively, they are all more aligned with the Conservatives than with the opposition, and they tend to vote with the government. Last night, in the second reading vote, five of the ex-Tory independents voted with the government. If you treat all seven as government votes, the size of the government’s working majority rises to 70. If you settle on five as a more realistic figure, the working majority is 66. Either way, as you say, the realistic “working majority” is larger than the Commons website implies. Rishi Sunak “has been pencilled in as a surprise guest at a political festival organised by Giorgia Meloni’s rightwing Brothers of Italy on Saturday”, the Financial Times is reporting. In his story, George Parker says: In appearing at the Atreju festival, Sunak would follow in the footsteps of former Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon and Hungary’s far-right prime minister Viktor Orbán, who have both appeared in the past. Sunak’s political relationship with Meloni has blossomed during 2023. At a meeting in Downing Street in April he told his Italian counterpart that their two countries were “very aligned” in values. Parker says Sunak has not yet confirmed that he is going, and that his attendance will depend on what “other commitments'” he has. Whether or not the Rwanda bill is compliant with international law remains a matter of dispute. Some distinguished lawyers says it isn’t, and that was the conclusion of a briefing from the joint committee on human rights yesterday. Officially, the government claims the bill is complaint. But the bill contains a section 19(1)(b) statement on the face of it from James Cleverly, the home secretary, saying he cannot be sure it is compatible with the European convention on human rights, and his language has been slightly evasive. In the Commons yesterday he spoke about the bill being “within the framework of international law” – which may not be quite the same thing. In his interview on the Today programme interview this morning, Cleverly signalled that, while not wanting to leave the European court of human rights (ECtHR), the government does want to change the way it operates. Referring to the court and other international institutions, he said: What we have seen is an unprecedented and new challenge. The scale of organised criminal people smuggling is unprecedented. It is something that has washed across north America, across Europe. We have got to take action. I [gave] a speech when I was foreign secretary at the Chatham House thinktank about my view that these postwar institutions, incredibly important, they need to survive, but they also need to reform in order to survive. The circumstances that we are seeing, digitally enabled organised criminal gangs smuggling on an industrial scale, is new. We have to respond to that novelty. And some of those postwar institutions – incredibly important, I desperately want them to survive – have got to recognise the tectonic plates are shifting, and we have to respond to that. Asked why he did not support Tory rightwingers who just want the UK to leave the ECtHR, Cleverly suggested it was better to get the court to change. He said: Sometimes countries are in dispute [with the ECtHR]. That is not unusual at all. In fact, that is the norm, rather than the exception. So it may well be that we find ourselves in dispute with international institutions. That happens a lot. Cleverly said the UK had already got the court to reform in some respects its use of emergency injunctions. The first flight to Rwanda was blocked by an injunction from the Strasbourg court, but, partly in response to lobbying from the UK, the court announced last month some changes to the way these will operate. Cleverly said: We made the case that the way they had been used was not appropriate in our view and the ECtHR have made changes because of our intervention. So you can both be in dispute with an international court, and you can also change an international court. We might need to do both. This is also an argument that David Cameron, the new foreign secretary, made in the House of Lords last week, citing his experience of dealing with the court over voting rights for prisoners. Rishi Sunak’s favourability ratings have hit a new low, according to new polling by YouGov. Rishi Sunak’s net favourability rating slips to a new low of -49 (fieldwork 11-12 Dec) Favourable: 21% (-5 from 28-29 Nov) Unfavourable: 70% (+5) After a year as PM, Rishi Sunak’s net popularity has now fallen to the same level as his party (both -49) By contrast, Keir Starmer currently stands at -22 and Labour at -14 Favourability of senior British politicians (11-12 Dec) Keir Starmer: -22 James Cleverly: -29 Suella Braverman: -46 Jeremy Hunt: -47 Rishi Sunak: -49 *Politicians with &gt;50% “don’t know” scores* Rachel Reeves: -10 Wes Streeting: -11 Victoria Atkins: -15 Sam Freedman, the Prospect columnist, had a good take on Rishi Sunak’s options for the Rwanda bill on X last night. Here are his main posts. Right so Sunak now has two strategic options. 1. He strengthens the bill and gets the GB News current and future presenters roster to vote with him but makes losing in Lords\/courts more likely (and Commons if “moderates” can locate their spines). 2. He does nothing and calls the right’s bluff. Turns third reading into a confidence vote and forces them to choose between supporting him and losing their jobs (in many cases). 3. He offers a tiny token gesture to the right that is largely meaningless and hopes they take the out. I’m guessing he tries 3 and then goes to 2 if that looks like it will fail. Then goes to 1 if it looks like that will fail. But either way plenty of opportunity for chaos and another month or so in which the government does not talk about or indeed do anything about the things that concern most voters. Sadiq Khan has warned that ministers’ plans to cut legal migration will lead to a “full blown recruitment crisis” in London, with vacancies in hospitality alone still higher than they were pre-pandemic. Daniel Boffey has the story. When Rishi Sunak announced that he would respond to the supreme court judgment saying the Rwanda deportation policy was unlawful with a new bill, he described it as emergency legislation, implying it would be rushed through parliament. But that is not happening. Although the bill has had a second reading, its remaining Commons stages are not due to be debated until January. And, in an interview this morning, James Cleverly, the home secretary, said it would take “some time” for the bill to become law. He told Sky News: We’ve got to get this bill through the House of Commons and the House of Lords. That will take some time … We’re going to move quickly but we’re going to make sure we get this right. Good morning. James Cleverly, the home secretary, has been doing a victory lap media round this morning after the government’s bigger-than-expected win in the Rwanda bill vote last night. Tory rebels abstained, rather than voted against, and there were “only” 29 of them – which is barely enough to put the government’s majority at risk, and quite small in the scale of Tory rebellions over recent years. But the jeopardy for Rishi Sunak is far from over. The rebels were only abstaining because they believe that they can get significant concessions to the bill when it is debated again over two days in January, and the gap between what the rightwingers are demanding (set out in the European Research Group’s legal “star chamber analysis) and the minimal tinkering Sunak seems to be offering is considerable. After the votes on amendments, there will be a final third reading vote on the bill as a whole and at that point some rightwingers say they will try to vote it down if they still don’t like it. Some Tory centrists have also said they will no longer vote for the bill if it’s been subject to an ERG rewrite. That is why most of the front pages today claim the parliamentary threat to Sunak remains very real. When the Guardian, the Daily Mail and the Daily Express all end up using more or less exactly the same headline, there’s a good chance it’s right. And here are some other headlines on the same theme. But in his interviews this morning Cleverly played down suggestions that the bill might be killed off in the new year. On Sky News Kay Burley asked him to respond to this comment from one unnamed Tory rebel quoted in reports this morning. This bill has been allowed to live another day. But without amendments it will be killed next month. It is now up to the government to decide what it wants to do. Cleverly did not accept the bill was at risk. Referring to Mark Francois, the chair of the European Research Groups, one of the rightwing Tory factions pushing for a tougher bill, he said: I will talk to Mark and I’ll talk to others, of course, to understand their thinking on this and try to harvest their ideas to make things better. But I can’t see if someone’s got a concern that the bill might not be as strong as they would like, killing the bill doesn’t strike me as the best way of doing that, because if the bill isn’t on the statute books it can’t possibly succeed. He also rejected claims some of his Conservative colleagues don’t want the bill to work. He said: No, this is absolutely wrong. The Conservative party is united on the desire to get this right and to stop the boats. The Labour party’s position is to try and wreck it. I will post more from his interviews soon. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Michelle Donelan, the science secretary, gives evidence to the Commons science committee about AI governance and other matters. 12pm: Rishi Sunak faces Keir Starmer at PMQs. 2.30pm: Michael Tomlinson, the minister for illegal migration, and Tom Pursglove, the minister for legal migration, give evidence to the Commons home affairs committee. 4pm: Victoria Atkins, the health secretary, gives evidence to the Commons health committee.

       "     'bodyText': 'The UK “isn’t being governed” as the Conservative party fights among itself, Keir Starmer has told Rishi Sunak at the last prime minister’s questions of the year, challenging him in particular on rates of homelessness. In exchanges that veered between brutal insults, Christmas greetings and occasional bad jokes, Starmer used the Tory divisions highlighted by Tuesday evening’s vote on the Rwanda deportations bill as a way to mock the prime minister. “Christmas is a time of peace on earth and good will to all. Has anyone told the Tory party?” he began, promoting a jokey response from Sunak about the so-called “five families”, the five rightwing Tory factions who have united to try to change the Rwanda bill. “Christmas is also a time for families, and under the Conservatives we do have a record number of them,” Sunak said to laughter. After further ridicule in which Starmer cited some of the anonymous descriptions of Sunak by Conservative MPs given to newspapers, he turned to what he said was the impact on the country of a government riven by internal battles. “While they fight amongst themselves there’s a country out here that isn’t being governed,” he said. “Doesn’t he think the government would be better off fixing the messes they’ve already made, rather than scrambling to create new ones?” Starmer said 140,000 children would be homeless at Christmas, adding: “That is more than ever before. That’s a shocking state of affairs. And it should shame this government.” He cited examples of this phenomenon, including an 11-year-old boy, Liam Walker, whose family is homeless, and whose Christmas wish was: “I don’t want any new toys. I just want all my old toys out of storage – I just want us to be happy again.” Starmer castigated Sunak for what he called the neglect of such issues as he struggled with infighting: “Instead of more social housing, housebuilding is set to collapse. Instead of banning no-fault evictions, thousands of families are at risk of homelessness. “Rather than indulging his backbenchers swanning around in their factions, their star chambers, pretending to be members of the mafia, when is he going to get a grip and focus on the country?” Sunak responded by accusing Starmer of devoting some of his questions to “political tittle-tattle” and criticised the record of Labour-run Wales on education. As is Starmer’s occasional habit at PMQs, he used his final question to make a consensual, cross-party point to try to blunt Sunak’s traditional final attack, in this case asking the prime minister to thank public servants and wish everyone a happy festive season. Sunak nonetheless pressed ahead with his remarks, criticising Labour’s plan to invest in green infrastructure projects, saying this would push up taxes, and that in contrast his government was “getting on and delivering for working Britain”.'},\n",

       "     'bodyText': 'Mark Drakeford has announced he is stepping down as the Welsh first minister and a contest for the leadership of Welsh Labour will begin shortly. Drakeford said: “I have today formally notified the chair of the Welsh executive committee of my intention to stand down as leader of Welsh Labour in March 2024. “When I stood for the leadership, I said that, if elected, I would serve for five years. Exactly five years have passed since I was confirmed as first minister in 2018. “Nominations for my successor as Welsh Labour leader will open shortly. The process will be concluded by the end of the spring term, to enable the name of the winner to be put to the Senedd before the Easter recess. In the meantime, I remain your first minister.” He added: “In a five-year period, which has seen Wales deal with austerity, Brexit, the Covid pandemic, the climate crisis, wars in Ukraine and the Middle East and four different prime ministers – so far – there will be lots to reflect on. “The next Welsh Labour leader and first minister will, I hope, have the opportunity, which has not come my way, to work with a newly elected Labour government in London. I will work as hard as I can to see that Labour government elected.” Drakeford had long said he would leave the post before the end of the current Senedd term in 2026 and in the summer made it clear he would leave the Welsh parliament completely at the next election. He was first elected as the Senedd member for Cardiff West in 2011 and became first minister after Carwyn Jones left the job eight years later. Drakeford’s role leading Wales’s response to the Covid crisis made him the most prominent Welsh leader since Rhodri Morgan and one of the UK’s most recognisable politicians. When he became leader almost exactly five years ago, he promised to follow “radical socialist traditions” in the style of Aneurin Bevan and Michael Foot and was vocal in his support for Jeremy Corbyn. He will be remembered for his cautious, avuncular style during the pandemic and also for a more recent and controversial policy: the introduction of 20mph speed limits in most built-up areas throughout Wales. The announcement comes at a sensitive time for the Labour administration, which is having to make wide-ranging budget cuts across almost all departments to help prop up the country’s struggling health service and rail system. Among the favourites to replace him will be Vaughan Gething, the economy minister, and Jeremy Miles, the education minister. Miles was one of the first to pay tribute, saying: “Mark Drakeford is an extraordinary man who has led Wales through extraordinary times. He has been a beacon for compassion in our politics, and an example of public service to our nation. “As we consider what comes next, I hope we will resolve to build on Mark’s legacy, to meet new challenges head on, and to set our sights on an ambitious future for Wales.” The UK Labour leader Keir Starmer said: “He’s a true titan of Welsh and Labour politics. It has been a pleasure to work alongside him and we all wish him the very best for his retirement.” The Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth paid tribute to Drakeford’s dedication to public life but accused him of squandering his chances to improve Wales and said during his term there had been longer NHS waiting lists, falling educational standards and a stagnant economy. He said: “Whoever is in charge of Labour in Wales, there’s no taking away from the fact that they take their orders from Keir Starmer, who has a blind spot to Wales and offers nothing to address our needs and aspirations.” The shadow secretary of state for Wales, Jo Stevens, said: “Mark Drakeford has epitomised public service and public duty throughout his time as first minister of Wales. His remarkable stewardship of Wales through the horror of the pandemic being the most obvious example. The leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew RT Davies, said: “While we may have different visions for Wales, I know I’m joined by colleagues in holding a huge amount of respect for his dedication to the job of first minister. “It’s important, however, with this announcement that there is no distraction from the really important job of delivering for the people of Wales. Labour politicians jockeying for the role of first minister must not detract from this.” Before entering politics, Drakeford worked as a probation officer, youth justice worker and Barnardo’s project leader in Cardiff. He has taught at Cardiff and Swansea universities.'},\n",

       "     'bodyText': 'MPs backed the contentious Rwanda bill despite a rebellion by rightwing MPs. The government won the first division with 337 votes. On the second division it had 313 votes. At least 25 Tory MPs definitely abstained on the Rwanda bill as an act of rebellion. Prior to the vote, Illegal Migration minister Michael Tomlinson told MPs he expects hundreds of people to be deported to Rwanda in 2024. Only 10% of voters think the government has done a good job managing immigration, new polling from Ipsos suggests. About 79% of people think the government has done a bad job. The National Audit Office has announced that it will publish a report on the costs of the Rwanda scheme next year. Nick Brown, a former chief whip, has announced he is standing down as an MP at the next election – and resigning his Labour party membership in protest at the way an allegation against him is being investigated. The MP for Newcastle upon Tyne East has had the whip suspended for more than a year after a complaint was lodged against him under the party’s independent complaints procedure. Brown said the complaint was made by a political rival and related to something alleged to have happened more than 25 years ago. He also said the accusations were “entirely false”. Wednesday’s Guardian. The front of the Daily Mail. Wednesday’s i. In response to this evening’s House of Commons vote on the Government’s Rwanda bill, Sacha Deshmukh, Amnesty International UK’s chief executive, said: “Stripping people of their rights and shipping them off to Rwanda when they’re seeking asylum in the UK is a clear dereliction of this country’s responsibilities toward some of the world’s most desperate people. It is an attack on the basic principle that human rights are universal. “People who’ve fled persecution and war in countries like Afghanistan, Iran, Syria and Ethiopia are entitled to seek a place of safety, and they deserve far better than this. “This bill should be dropped in its entirety along with this Government’s policy to avoid properly processing people’s asylum claims in the UK.” Wednesday’s Metro. Here are some of Wednesday’s front pages starting with the FT. Labour MP Peter Kyle has outlined the reasons for him voting against the Bill. The SNP’s home affairs spokesperson, Alison Thewliss MP said: “This cruel Westminster Bill, which ignores the Supreme Court ruling and breaches international law, was not passed in Scotland’s name. “It in no way reflects Scotland’s values of compassion, humanity and upholding international law. Nor does it take into account that migration benefits Scotland’s economy and our public services. “That is why SNP MPs voted against it and tabled an amendment to try to stop the Bill in its tracks.” Following the decision by the House of Commons to allow the Rwanda Bill to progress, Green Party peer Natalie Bennett said if it reaches the House of Lords, it will be its “constitutional duty to safeguard the rule of law”, knowing that it can definitively stop the Bill. Bennett, said: “The Lords have a duty to protect the rule of law from a government that is showing a typically Hard Right disregard for the rule of law. “The Lords have the power to stop this legislation and must not hide behind the mask of being ‘an unelected House’ in failing to do so.” “The Rwanda Bill excludes the courts from their proper constitutional function of upholding Parliament’s laws. If the courts are prevented from doing their job, Ministers could ignore the laws made by parliament, or apply them incorrectly. “The government is seeking to put Ministers above the law. We need a strong second chamber acting as a watchdog of the rule of law.” ITV’s Robert Peston has posted this on X in the past few minutes about the abstentions: Late on Tuesday afternoon, a couple of dozen Conservative rightwingers hustled into the Wilson Room in Portcullis House, parliament’s modern extension. There were two goals for the meeting. Ostensibly, it was to agree how they would vote in Tuesday night’s crunch vote on the Rwanda bill – a moment they knew could define Rishi Sunak’s premiership. But there was also a second reason for meeting so close the vote itself: to make sure that after a frantic 36 hours of lobbying by the prime minister and his officials, the members of the loose affiliation of Tory MPs would not falter at the last and vote in favour of the bill. Members emerged minutes before the voting began, with representatives from five major backbench groups – dubbed the five families after the New York mafia – announcing they would not support the bill. The meeting, and the subsequent dramatic walk down to the chamber of the House of Commons to vote, capped an extraordinary two days in Westminster which saw internal Tory battles play out publicly in a way not seen since the Brexit wars of 2017-19. From Labour MP Jess Phillips. Around two-dozen Tory rightwingers did not vote, among them Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, who was sacked last month, and Robert Jenrick, who resigned as immigration minister last week over the bill. Miriam Cates, from the New Conservatives, said: “We agree that the bill is defective as it is. We don’t believe it will stop the boats. There are too many opportunities for legal challenge. We do support the principle of the bill, which is to stop the boats.” Despite voting to support the Bill, former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said he could always rescind his backing at a later date. He said: “We always reserve the right to do what we have to do when we think it doesn’t work, my personal view is I want to see the government listen and engage. “Right now this was a very difficult Bill to get through, very contentious, it was the toughest bit of legislation concerning people’s rights, in terms of asylum seekers, that we’ve seen, and that’s because the crisis is big and many people are dying in the channel. “It’s happening all over Europe – France is in defiance of the European court, sending people back. “Denmark passed legislation to send people back, Sweden is doing the same, Germany is in turmoil, Italy is talking about defying the court – this is not just the UK. “It’s part of the problem that all around Europe we’re facing, so this is the issue here on our island and we have to resolve it, otherwise it creates chaos.” Ben Riley-Smith from the Telegraph says by his count 29 Tory MPs abstained as an act of rebellion. **29 Tory MPs rebelled** - 37 Tory MPs abstained (Stats updated, wrongly said 38) - 8 of the 37 were paired (Per both Tories + Labour) So 29 rebels, listed below Maybe enough just to force defeat next time By chance, 29 is the figure quoted as the number of Tory MPs who would need to vote against a bill for it to be defeated. That’s all from me for today. Nadeem Badshah is taking over now. Sir Robert Syms is listed on the division list as not voting for the Rwanda bill. But he says he did vote for it. It is not unusual for the early division lists to include errors. Presumably it will get amended when it has been checked. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said tonight’s vote showed how weak Rishi Sunak has become. In a statement she said: The Conservatives’ civil war is continuing, and the country is paying the price for this chaos. Today’s debate shows how weak Rishi Sunak is with this Tory psychodrama now dragging on into the New Year. The costs of the failing Rwanda scheme are apparently rising to £400 million of taxpayers’ money, while no one has yet been sent and this scheme is only likely to cover less than 1% of those arriving in the UK. They’ve broken the Tory party, broken the asylum system and broken every promise they have made to the British people. Britain deserves better than this. They should instead be cracking down on the criminal smuggler gangs, setting up a new returns unit to reverse the 50% collapse in returns, and clearing the asylum backlog to end hotel use as Labour would do. This is what Mark Francois, chair of the European Research Group, said in his briefing for journalists just before the voting started claiming Rishi Sunak has agreed to tighten the bill. He said: We have decided collectively that we cannot support the bill tonight because of its many omissions, therefore while it’s down to every individual colleague ultimately to decide what to do, collectively we will not be supporting it. The prime minister has been telling colleagues today he is prepared to entertain tightening the bill, with that aim, at the committee stage, we will aim to table an amendment which would we hope, if accepted, would materially improve the bill and remove some of its weaknesses. For want of a better phrase, you might want to call it the [Sir Bill] Cash amendment, because he’ll undoubtedly be helping to draft it. We very much hope those amendments will be accepted – if they are not and the bill remains unamended, in that way again, collectively, we reserve the right to vote against it at third reading, that is collectively what we have decided. At least 25 Tory MPs definitely abstained on the Rwanda bill as an act of rebellion. Here is the list of 24 Tory MPs who did not vote on the second reading, but who did vote against the Labour amendment. That means it is fair to say the all deliberately abtained. Sir Jake Berry Suella Braverman Sir Bill Cash Miriam Cates Sir Simon Clarke Sarah Dines Richard Drax Sir James Duddridge Natalie Elphicke Mark Francois Chris Green Jonathan Gullis Sir John Hayes Adam Holloway Tom Hunt Caroline Johnson David Jones Danny Kruger Marco Longhi Craig Mackinlay Robin Millar Jill Mortimer John Redwood Sir Robert Syms – See note below – Syms says he was included in this list as a mistake And here is the 14 list of Tory MPs who did not vote in either division. It is understood that eight of them were paired. Of the other six, some, such as Robert Jenrick, were definitely abstaining to make a point. UPDATE: All six of the non-paired MPs were deliberately abstaining, the Telegraph reports. I have maked their names in bold. See 8.39pm. Rehman Chishti Theo Clarke Tobias Ellwood Jo Gideon Dame Andrea Jenkyns Robert Jenrick Julia Marson Stephen McPartland Caroline Nokes Jesse Norman Dan Poulter Andrew Rosindell Alok Sharma Chris Skidmore UDPATE: Sir Robert Syms says he did vote for the bill, and that his name is included in the list of MPs who did not vote by mistake. (See 8.30pm.) Rishi Sunak has posted this on X. The British people should decide who gets to come to this country – not criminal gangs or foreign courts. That’s what this Bill delivers. We will now work to make it law so that we can get flights going to Rwanda and stop the boats. The division list for the second reading division is now on the Commons website. It shows that 38 Conservative MPs did not vote. There were 16 Tories who did not vote in the first division and most of those were probably MPs who had a legitimate reason not to be in the chamber (such as Alok Sharma, the former Cop president, who is at Cop), rather than MPs who were actively abstaining (such as Robert Jenrick). That suggests the number of intentional abstentions was probably in the 20s. No Conservative MP voted against the bill, the division list showed. On the subject of the next votes, MPs are now voting on the programme motion, which says that the bill will be referred to a committee of the whole house (instead of just going to a small committee for the committee stage) and that two days will be set aside for the remaining stages of the bill to be debated (six hours each day). It does not say when these debates will take place, but they are expected in early January. The government won the first division with 337 votes. On the second division it had 313 votes, implying that only 24 Conservatives actively abstained. That suggests the voting clout of the so-called five families may be less than Mark Francois imagines. (See 6.57pm.) The working assumption has been that the Tory rebels would need at least 29 MPs to vote against the bill to bring about its defeat. Now there must be some doubt as to whether they have the numbers – although views may have changed by the time the next votes take place after Christmas. The government has won by 313 votes to 269 – a majority of 44. The division list also shows five independent MPs and one Reclaim MP all voting with the government on the Labour amendment. They are all either ex-Conservative MPs or Tories suspended from the party. The division list for the first vote is now available on the Commons website. Here is the page showing MPs who did not vote, including 16 Tory MPs and eight Labour MPs. Presumably the eight Labour MPs are people who are authorised to be away. From Sky’s Beth Rigby On how many abstentions, source from the right involved in the meeting: ‘there were more than 40 MPs in room and collective view was abstain. Not all in the room and not everyone will agree’….. Here is a screenshot showing some of the Tory MPs who have been visibly abstaining in the division. Christopher Hope from GB News says there are about 100 Conservative MPs in the the so-called five families of rightwing Tory groups. The government has a working majority of 56 and so if 57 MPs abstained, the government should be on course to lose. Sources tell me there are 100 Conservative MPs in the ‘five families’. If they all abstain the Government loses the Rwanda Bill tonight. But it is worth pointing out: a) These figures are not confirmed. Some of the five groups – the ERG, New Conservatives, the Common Sense Group, the Conservative Growth Group and the Northern Research Group – are quite cagey about how many members they have, and there is considerable overlap. b) There is no record of the five families effectively whipping all their members en bloc. During most of the big Brexit debates the ERG did operate as a party within a party, and members voted with the ERG line in a disciplined way. But towards the end the ERG split, and unity broke down. The other groups have not tried operating whipping operations akin to the ERG’s in 2019. c) Francois and his colleagues clearly expect the bill to pass tonight, because they are talking about amending it – and, indeed, looking forward to doing so. If the bill falls tonight, then the chances of parliament passing any Rwanda legislation before an election are minimal. The Labour amendment has been defeated, by 337 votes to 269 – a government majority of 68. MPs are now voting on the main motion – that the bill be read a second time. In his briefing Mark Francois, chair of the European Research Group, said the ERG and the other four rightwing Tory groups had decided to reserve the right to vote against the bill at third reading if it does not get amended to their satisfaction. (See 7.02pm.) Sam Coates from Sky News has posted on X quotes from the Mark Francois briefing. The debate is over, and MPs are now voting on the Labour amendment. It says: That this House, while affirming support for securing the UK’s borders, reforming the broken asylum system and ending dangerous small boat crossings, declines to give a second reading to the safety of Rwanda (asylum and immigration) bill because the bill will not work to tackle people smuggling gangs, end small boat crossings or achieve the core purposes of the bill, will lead to substantial costs to the UK taxpayer every year whilst applying to less than one per cent of those who claim asylum in the UK, threatens the UK’s compliance with international law, further undermines the potential to establish security and returns agreements with other countries and does not prevent the return of relocated individuals who commit serious crimes in Rwanda back to the UK. The government is expected to win this vote when it is announced, at around 7.15pm. Then MPs will vote on the main motion. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, intervened and put it to Michael Tomlinson that the ERG statement meant the PM’s breakfast meeting had failed. Tomlinson did not accept that. While Tomlinson has been speaking, Mark Francois, the chair of the European Research Group, has been at a press briefing. He said the ERG, the New Conservatives, the Common Sense Group, the Conservative Growth Group and the Northern Research Group could not support the bill. He said the bulk of their members would abstain. But he claimed that Rishi Sunak had indicated to them that he was willing to accept amendments that would tighten the bill. Government lawyers would meet lawyers from the ERG’s “star chamber” to discuss the way forward, he said. He said he was prepared to take Sunak at his word. UPDATE: Francois said: We have decided collectively that we cannot support the bill tonight because of its many omissions, therefore while it’s down to every individual colleague ultimately to decide what to do, collectively we will not be supporting it. The prime minister has been telling colleagues today he is prepared to entertain tightening the bill, with that aim, at the committee stage, we will aim to table an amendment which would we hope, if accepted, would materially improve the bill and remove some of its weaknesses. For want of a better phrase, you might want to call it the [Sir Bill] Cash amendment, because he’ll undoubtedly be helping to draft it. We very much hope those amendments will be accepted – if they are not and the bill remains unamended, in that way again, collectively, we reserve the right to vote against it at third reading, that is collectively what we have decided. Sir Bill Cash (Con) asks if the government will seek permission from the speaker to change the long title of the bill to ensure that amendments the ERG wants to make to the bill can be accepted as in order. Tomlinson says he is willing to speak to Cash about that. Pete Wishart (SNP) asks how many asylum seekers will be deported to Rwanda next year. Tomlinson replies: It will start off in the hundreds and it will scale up to the thousands. He does not say when it might scale up to the thousands. He implies next year, but is not specific. Michael Tomlinson, the new minister for illegal migration, is winding up for the government. He pays tribute to Robert Jenrick, the previous minister, for the work he did. He says they agree on some points. But he agrees with Jenrick on the need for legal certainty, and he will work with him on this point. He says the government respects the supreme court. It has responded not just with a bill, but with a treaty. Some MPs have raised moral arguments. But there is a moral case for stopping the boats. There is nothing compassionate in allowing small boat crossings to continue, he says. Kinnock says Labour wants to stop the boats. But it will never vote for “a madcap gimmick” that is unaffordable and unworkable. He says Labour believes that, in return for an upfront investment in the immigration system, it could save £2bn. He says Labour has set out in its reasoned amendment why it is opposed to the bill. Rishi Sunak invited Tory MPs for breakfast this morning. But in reality, he was on the menu, he says. He ends by saying Sunak should call an election. Stephen Kinnock, the shadow immigration minister, is now winding up for Labour. He starts by thanking MPs who have expressed their condolences to him over the death of his mother, the former MEP and peer Glenys Kinnock. He says the Rwanda scheme was dreamt up when Boris Johnson was prime minister, and looking to cling to power. Like every other Johnson scheme, it was expensive and doomed to fail. But now Rishi Sunak is trying to implement this “Faragist” plan, he says. The new bill, which asserts that Rwanda is safe, is the equivalent of saying grass is blue and the sky is green. On this basis, he would introduce a bill saying Wales on the World Cup, he says. He says the “semi-skimmed” version of this bill satisfies no one on the Tory side. It is bound to fail. The home secretary said last week that the bill complies with international law. But the first page of the bill says it might not, he says. The bill says Rwanda is safe. But the bill also says that the UK might accept asylum seekers from Rwanda. And it says that, if someone sent to Rwanda commits a crime, they could be sent back to the UK. The Rwandans really did see the UK coming. They have got £400m, without taking a single asylum seeker. I have beefed up quite a few of the earlier posts with direct quotes from the speeches in the debate. To get the updates to show, you may need to refresh the page. Duncan Baker (Con) says he will back the bill because controlling borders should be a fundamental right for a country. Backbench MPs are now limited to five minutes for their speeches. Meg Hillier (Lab), chair of the public accounts committee, says the Home Office released figures for the costs of the Rwanda programme only last week, after those figures were leaked to the IMF. She says an investigation is under way into what happened. She says, until then, the department said it would release the figures in its annual accounts. But that is not how costs for a project this large should be disclosed, she says. Only 10% of voters think the government has done a good job managing immigration, new polling from Ipsos suggests. About 79% of people think the government has done a bad job. Those thinking the government has handled this badly include 81% of the people who voted Tory in 2019, and 74% of the people who support the Conservatives now. But the same poll suggests only 24% of people think Labour would do a better job at handling immigration – down from 29% in July. James Daly (Con) says MPs should pass bills that reflect the concerns of their constituents, not ones that appeal to middle-class liberal consciences. He says the bill is right to allow individuals to appeal against deportation in certain conditions. It is a good policy, and within the bounds of international law, he says. Back in the Commons, Joanna Cherry (SNP) says Tory MPs who believe that the Rwanda bill is consistent with international law are deluding themselves. As evidence for this, she cites the points made in the report from the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law and in the briefing from the joint committee on human rights. She also says the government should explain why it has not sought a legislative consent motion for the bill from the Scottish parliament. The National Audit Office has announced that it will publish a report on the costs of the Rwanda scheme next year. The head of the NAO, Gareth Davies, has said this in a letter to the chairs of the Commons public accounts committee and the home affairs committee. In his letter Davies said: I have considered your suggestion to assess the value for money of the UK-Rwanda scheme and I do not think it possible to conclude on value for money at this stage, given that this rests on the deterrent effect of the scheme. However, owing to the high-profile nature of the scheme and in light of the issues raised at the PAC session on 11 December, I have decided to produce a factual report covering the costs incurred to-date and the Department’s estimate of costs when the scheme is operational. On completion of this work, I intend to lay a report in the house after which your committees may choose to take further evidence. I plan to publish this report in 2024. In a joint statement responding to the letter, Meg Hillier, chair of the public accounts committee, and Diana Johnson, chair of the home affairs committee, said: Both of our committees have long called on the Home Office for greater transparency around the Rwanda asylum plan. It is essential that parliament is in full possession of the facts around a scheme of such high public interest. As the government has thus far been unwilling or unable to provide these facts, we are grateful to the National Audit Office for its forthcoming work to keep the taxpayer informed on the plan’s costs, both to date and when the scheme becomes operational. In the Commons Nicholas Fletcher, the Conservative MP for Don Valley, told MPs that he supported the bill. He said his constituents wanted the problem of small boats stopped. He said he was elected as a result of Brexit and that, if the government did not deal with small boats, he would not be coming back to the Commons. That generated a loud cheer from Labour MPs. UPDATE: Fletcher said: I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, Doncaster is full … We are turning parts of our community into a ghetto … [People] don’t expect to be called racist or xenophobic for saying ‘we liked it as it was’, and if we’re going to have immigration, which I don’t completely believe is a bad thing to do, it just needs to be controlled immigration … We’ve got friends on this side of the House who want this Bill stronger and I’m going to work with them, and I’m hopefully going to work with you because we must make this work, we have to stop the boats. Matt Warman (Con), who is one of the Conservative One Nation Caucus, says he is voting for the bill, but without any enthusiasm. He says MPs have a duty to tackle the problem of immigration. They should support the bill, even if it isn’t perfect. David Simmonds (Con) says he started off as a Rwanda sceptic. He thought it would be a very expensive policy. But, on the basis of what he observed in Calais, and what he heard from officials, he concluded it could act as a deterrent for some people. The policy, and the bill today, have “enormous utility”, he says. Simon Hart, the government chief whip, has cancelled a meeting with potential Tory rebels, to make time for talks with No 10, Pippa Crerar reports. Sir Edward Leigh (Con) told MPs that he wanted parliament to pass the bill as quickly as possible. He said that, to stop the UK being affected by injunctions from the European court of human rights, it would probably be necessary to leave the European convention on human rights. The government did not have a mandate for that, he said. He said that might be a matter for the next manifesto. But MPs had to be realistic, he said, and he claimed the bill probably went as far as was possible now. At the afternoon lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson sounded marginally more open to accepting amendments to the Rwanda bill from rightwing Tories than he did this morning. (See 12.27pm and 3.24pm.) Asked if the current version of the bill was at the limits of what was acceptable to Rwanda (which has said, if the UK breaks international law, it will no longer support the deportation agreement), the spokesperson said: The Rwandan government’s position is in relation to the international law elements. There are other aspects of the bill that don’t relate purely to that, so I’m not going to rule out considering any further suggestions that MPs may make or have made. Those conversations are ongoing. Sammy Wilson from the DUP says all MPs should support what the bill is trying to do. But he questions whether it works, and he says the government has not learned from the mistakes with previous immigration bills. But he says the bill creates specific problems for Northern Ireland. He says Belfast is the city in the UK with the second largest number of immigrants, which creates pressure on housing. And he says the EU’s charter of fundamental rights applies in Northern Ireland. He suggests that could lead to asylum seekers from the rest of the UK coming to Northern Ireland on the grounds that would give them a better chance of staying. UPDATE: Wilson said: What is the impact of that going to be? Well, the first thing is this: It is going to make Northern Ireland a magnet for people who may find that the route to stay in the United Kingdom is blocked. But in Northern Ireland, of course it won’t be, because we will still be under EU immigration rules, and the European Court of Justice can make a judgment. The second thing is this: if those people decide they don’t want to remain in Northern Ireland, then of course with the free movement from Northern Ireland to the rest of the United Kingdom and indeed with the common travel area, they can move into the rest of the United Kingdom. The implication of course is if that becomes a large number of people, are we then going to have people barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom? These are issues which I believe either have not been even considered by the minister, or have been wilfully neglected, and for that reason we cannot give support to this bill. Jackie Doyle-Price (Con) says MPs should not let the best be the enemy of the good. By passing this bill, they will help deal with the problem. She tells her colleagues that, although this bill may not match their ideology, it will help to make the situation better. Natalie Elphicke, the Conservative MP for Dover, says it was diplomacy that allowed the UK and France, working together, to stop people getting into the UK illegally via lorries. She says diplomacy is needed again, to get a returns agreement with France. She says the UK should be returning people to France, not Rwanda. She also says the UK should start international discussions on a new global migration settlement. She wants to stop the boats, she says. But she says she is gravely concerned that this bill won’t do what the government intends. If a former home secretary (Suella Braverman), a former immigration minister (Robert Jenrick) and the MP for the constituency most affected (Elphicke herself) are all saying the bill may not work, the government should listen, she says. Tommy Sheppard (SNP) says he is disappointed that the Tories are only talking about migrants in negative terms. He says they are weaponising this for political gain. And, referring to the business model for people smugglers, he says the government created their business model – by closing down legal routes for asylum seekers. Simon Fell (Con) says the government is not acting alone. Other governments around the world are working on schemes similar to this one, he says. He says voting for this bill is the best means of stopping the boats. Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, describes the bill as a “cynical and sinister attack on the highest court in the UK”. The bill won’t work, she says. And it won’t serve as a deterrent to people who are already risking their lives. It’s “a performative piece of cruelty from a dying administraton”, she says. Danny Kruger, co-chair of the New Conservatives, is speaking now, and he starts by saying he welcomes what the bill is trying to achieve. But he expresses concern about individual challenges to deportation being allowed. He says he is not calling at this point for the UK to leave the European convention on human rights. But, if the European court of human rights were to continue to block deportations, at that point the UK could being a “conversation” that might lead to the departure. Referring to the supreme court judgment, he says it was wrong for the court to insert itself into foreign policy and make “rather patronising” judgments about the Rwandan system. He says he cannot support the bill tonight. And he had been hoping the government would pull it. David Jones, another Conservative who is a member of the European Research Group’s legal “star chamber” that published a critical assessment of the bill yesterday, is speaking now. He says it is debatable whether the bill is sufficiently watertight. Referring to the ERG report, he says amendments to the bill are required. But some of those amendments may be outside the scope of the bill (which would mean they could not be put to a vote), he says. He says he wants to hear the minister, Michael Tomlinson, confirm that the government is open to amendments in his winding up speech tonight. (See 3.24pm.) There are “numerous deficiencies” with the bill at the moment which will make it “inoperable and ineffective”. He says a lot of MPs will be listening carefully to Tomlinson’s speech. He says they will want to hear “a change of tone”. Rishi Sunak is now meeting Tory MPs sceptical about the Rwanda bill one to one, Sky’s Beth Rigby reports. Told by a senior Conservative rebel that the PM “is pulling out all the stops now” and is now talking to the MPs he met in No 10 this morning “one-on-one”. Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, will vote against the bill unless he gets an assurance that the government will amend it, Emilio Casalicchio from Politico reports. Jenrick will vote against the bill unless the govt promises to amend it, in which case he’ll abstain That suggests quite a lot may hinge on what Michael Tomlinson, the minister for illegal migration, says in his winding up speech, at about 6.50pm. Backbenchers who want assurances from the government like to hear them given in public, at the dispatch box, rather than in private. Downing Street has been evasive about whether or not it will accept amendments to the bill. At the lobby briefing this morning the PM’s spokesperson implied the government may be open to some (see 12.27pm), but he did not say that explicitly. Sir Robert Buckland’s speech a few minutes ago illustrated the dilemma. An amendment that would win over Jenrick’s vote would lose Buckland’s. (See 3.12pm.) Dame Priti Patel is speaking now. She says, as the home secretary who set up the Rwanda scheme, she finds it strange listening to the debate; she does not approve of what is being said about the country. The deal has “raised the bar” for the treatment of asylum seekers, she says. It has already resettled 130,000 refugees, she says. Referring to injunctions from the European court of human rights – she says she has experience of them, referring to how a European human rights court injunction blocked a flight to Rwanda when she was home secretary – she says she wants to know how the government will respond to future challenges. Sir Robert Buckland, the former Conservative justice secretary, says the UK has a system of checks and balances. Like Sir Bob Neill, he also stresses the importance of comity. He says the small boats present a challenge. But that does not mean the rule of law can be ignored, he says. Even in wartime, parliament protected freedom, he says. He says, if clause 4 (allowing some individual legal challenges to continue) were to be removed from the bill, as some Conservative MPs are proposing, that would “set up a massive glass jaw to be smashed by a court in future”. He says, if the bill is amended in that direction, he will no longer be able to support it. As Conservatives, it is their “constitutional duty” to retain balance, he says. UPDATE: Buckland said: The principle of comity is one that we can ill afford to overlook. What do I mean by that? Well, I mean that mutual respect that has to exist between the different arms of the constitution. This place is sovereign, we derive our sovereignty from the people, but we also have a responsibility to use that in a responsible way … I am the first one, the first person, to assert the authority of this place. But what I won’t do, what I won’t be a party to, is legislation that in effect invites the courts to come on up if you are hard enough. That is not the approach that we as responsible Conservatives should take … If this bill is to be amended in a way that crosses that line, then I cannot support that, and I will not support that. This is from the Scotsman’s Alexander Brown. Even Tory MPs backing the Rwanda bill are unhappy, and believe it won’t survive at third reading. One tells me: “All we’ve done is make a bigger problem for ourselves in January, and all for a policy that’s probably illegal. No10 has fucked it, totally fucked it” Sir Bob Neill, the Conservative chair of the justice committee, says he can just about vote for the bill. But he stresses that he is a constitutionalist. He suggests the day the Conservative party thinks that the ends justify the means, and that it can ignore the principle of comity, he will no longer be able to support it. The government must recognise the importance of checks and balances, he says. He says, with “great endeavour”, ministers have just kept on the right side of the line. But he says they should not give in to MPs who want them to go further. UPDATE: Neill said: After a good deal of hesitation I shall support this bill tonight, but it is a hesitation that has been real, because for me it goes as close to the wind as one can constitutionally do … If it were to change and any of the safeguards that have been left in to be removed, then my support would go, because some people would then have pushed it over the line into the unacceptable and, in my judgment, the unconservative, and then I would not support it. Kitty Donaldson from Bloomberg says some Tory rebels think between 20 and 30 MPs will rebel tonight. A government MP can rebel either by voting against the government, or by abstaining. - Close to wire BUT three Tory rebels privately think Rishi Sunak will win the vote tonight - One puts number of rebels at 20 - Another predicts 25 but only 10 voting against - Third suggests 20-30 with most abstaining - Next skirmish in Jan In his interview on the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg at the weekend, Robert Jenrick, asked if he would be voting for the bill, replied: “No, I won’t be supporting this bill. But I do think we can fix it.” In his speech this afternoon Jenrick sounded more positive about the bill. He said: This is not a bad bill but it is not the best bill. I want this bill to work. The test of this policy is not: ‘Is it the strongest bill we’ve done?’, it’s not: ‘Is it a good compromise?’, it’s: ‘Will it work?’ That is all the public care about. They don’t care about Rwanda as a scheme, they care about stopping the boats. And we are sent here to do that for them. I will never elevate contested notions of international law over the interests of my constituents, over vital national interests like national security, like border security. This bill could be so much better, let’s make it better. Let’s make it work. This prompted some speculation on social media that he might vote for the bill after all. But Emilio Casalicchio has confirmed that Jenrick is not voting for the bill. Jenrick is expected to abstain, like other Conservative MPs with doubts about the bill. Sir Geoffrey Cox, the Conservative former attorney general, is next up. He has been giving interviews within the past 24 hours backing the government, and he says he wants to address both those who think the bill goes too far, and those who thinks it does not go far enough. Addressing Labour critics of the bill, he says the last Labour government declared that some countries should be deemed safe for asylum seekers. Some people say this bill is different because the bill is reversing a supreme court judgment. But parliament is entitled to reverse a decision by the courts, he says. He says this bill is doing exactly what Labour did in 2004. He says the new treaty with Rwanda removes the risk of “refoulement” – asylum seekers being sent back to the country where they were at risk of persecution. Turning to the Tory objections to the bill, he says it would be wrong to remove all rights to legal challenge to deportation. If the government did that, the deal with Rwanda would collapse, he says. The right to go to court in an extreme case is part of the British constitution that the Conservative party has long defended, he says. UPDATE: Cox said: I understand the frustration and the deep and intense dissatisfaction at the current situation, I share it, I think there are tightenings that we can do, particularly on rule 39 [injunctions from the European court of human rights]. But on the preservation of the right to go to court in an extreme case, I say that is part of the British constitution that our fathers and our party has supported, and fought for for generations, and it’d be wrong for us to compromise on it. Diana Johnson, the Labour chair of the home affairs committee, is speaking now. She says her committee has not been able to get the Home Office to say how much it will spend on each individual asylum seeker sent to Rwanda. She says Michael Tomlinson, the minister for illegal migration, should provide costings when he winds up the debate later. Back in the Commons Sir Bill Cash, who led the European Research Group’s “star chamber” panel of legal experts who published a report on the Rwanda bill, is speaking now. He says if parliament passes a law, the courts should apply it, whether it breaks international law or not. He praises Robert Jenrick for his speech. And he says that he thinks the bill can be improved. A reader asks: The government is recalling a minister from the climate summit. Why can’t they ask the opposition for a pairing? Given the importance of Cop28 to the UK, Labour might have agreed to this ... or is this more performative from the Conservatives? The government and opposition do agree to pair MPs, and I’m sure they have done that today. But if the opposition have only got, say, 14 MPs who can’t make the vote because they are ill\/away or whatever, that is all they will offer the government – even if the government wants more pairs. And the government normally has more people away because there 100-odd MPs who are in government and might be away on government business. Alison Thewliss, the SNP’s spokesperson on home affairs, says the Rwanda bill will not work because it does not deal with the reasons people come to the UK. She says her constituency has the highest asylum caseload in Scotland. She refers to a constituent from Sudan granted refugee status. He says he just wants his wife to join him. But there is no safe and legal refugee route from Sudan. So what would MPs do if they were in his position? UPDATE: Thewliss said: If we start to offload our international responsibilities to any third country, we’re effectively surrendering our influence over what then happens next. This government themselves have become people traffickers, sending human beings offshore against their will as if they were some kind of waste to be processed rather than human beings alike in dignity … If a humanitarian travel document existed, those same young people could avoid the perilous journey in a leaky rubber dingy, they could get the same train or ferry as many travellers do every year, they would not need to pay people smugglers at all. That would kill the business model. Robert Jenrick starts by saying the government has made progress tackling illegal immigration. Small boat arrivals have been cut by a third, he says. In other European countries, illegal immigration is going up. So the PM’s plan is working, he says. He claims Labour does not believe in border security. This will be one of the defining issues of the 21st century, he says. He says the strongest possible deterrent is needed. And the Rwanda scheme is the only possible deterrent available in the next 12 months. He says that, having immersed himself in the detail, he thinks the Rwanda scheme will work. He says people don’t like having asylum hotels in their towns. Even MPs who are the strongest supporters of open borders object to asylum hotels, he says. He accuses them of hypocrisy. If Labour were in power, there would be a decade of small boat arrivals, he says. Turning to the bill, he says there are two main problems with it. First, it will not stop people appealing as individuals against deportation orders. This will provide legal certainty. And it is necessary for operational reasons, too, he says. That’s because, if individual claims are allowed, the courts will be overwhelmed with claims, and detention facilities will fill up. People will have to be released, and they will disappear. That will bring the system into disrepute. Meg Hillier (Lab) says she is a former immigration minister. At the end of Labour’s last term in government, one person was being removed every eight minutes, she says. She asks what Jenrick’s record is. Jenrick says there has been a ten-fold increase in the pace of decision-making. He says Labour is on rocky ground. Turning back to the bill, he says it is inevitable that the European court of human rights will impose further injunctions to block deportation flights. They have to stop that, he says. He says the provision in the bill is “sophistry”. He says it is government policy that rule 39 injunctions are binding in international law. MPs are being asked to vote for a provision in the bill (allowing ministers to ignore those injuctions) that it would be illegal to use. This is the point Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg was getting at earlier. See 1.03pm. UPDATE: Jenrick said: It is inevitable … in light of the supreme court’s judgment, that the Strasbourg court will impose further rule 39 interim measures … we have to stop that, it is a matter of sovereignty for our country that ministers acting on the instructions of parliament do not allow those flights to be delayed. The provision in the bill is sophistry. It is the express policy of the government that rule 39 injunctions are binding and to ignore them would be a breach of international law. So, we are being asked to vote for a provision which it would be illegal to use. Dame Rosie Winterton, the deputy speaker, says many MPs want to speak. She suggests an eight-minute time limit on speeches. She calls Robert Jenrick, the former immigration minister, as the first backbencher speaker. Cooper says MPs should be building cross-party consensus on this. As Tory MPs jeer, she says they cannot even build consensus on their own side on this. Sir John Hayes (Con) says Labour MPs think international law trumps the sovereignty of parliament, while MPs on his side believe the opposite. Cooper says they are debating this bill not because of a judgment from a foreign court, but because of a ruling from the supreme court. She says the Tory row is not about having a workable solution to his issue. Sir Geoffrey Cox, a former Tory attorney general, says the past Labour government deemed a whole list of countries safe for asylum seekers. Cooper says Cox is wrong. What the government is doing with this bill is not just deeming countries safe, but preventing courts from considering the facts. She says the government itself acknowledged in its legal guidance published yesterday that reality cannot be ignored. She quotes this passage from the advice: Deeming clauses are used frequently in domestic law and there is a rich case law on how they are to be interpreted. In Fowler v Revenue and Customs [2020] UKSC 22, Lord Briggs, writing in a unanimous supreme court judgment, endorsed the position that: “A deeming provision should not be applied so far as to produce unjust, absurd or anomalous results, unless the court is compelled to do so by clear language. But the court should not shrink from applying the fiction created by the deeming provision to the consequences which would inevitably flow from the fiction being real. As Lord Asquith memorably put it in East End Dwellings Co Ltd v Finsbury borough council [1952] AC 109, at 133: ‘The statute says that you must imagine a certain state of affairs; it does not say that having done so, you must cause or permit your imagination to boggle when it comes to the inevitable corollaries of that state of affairs.’” Conor Burns (Con) asks how long it would take Labour to stop small boat crossings. He says Cooper should give a date to the British people. Cooper says Burns is just highlighting how much the government has failed. She says Labour does want to stop the boats. It will smash the gangs, get returns agreements, and go much further in terms of cooperating with France, she says. She says the bill risks breaking international law. But that will make it harder for the UK to get further returns agreements, she says. Cooper says under the Rwanda treaty asylum seekers who commit serious crimes in Rwanda will be sent back to the UK. She says the UK is not accepting Afghans who helped British forces in Afghanistan. But, under this plan, it would have to accept criminals. “You couldn’t make it up,” she says. Cooper says Labour would set up a new returns unit, with 1,000 staff, to have proper enforcment in place. She claims this, combined with more case workers, would save the taxpayer £2bn. This is what Aubrey Allegretti has posted on X about James Cleverly repeately muttering “What’s your plan?” at Yvette Cooper while she is speaking. (At least this is an improvement on some of Cleverly’s other recent heckles in the chamber.) Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, is opening her speech. She says Cleverly has confirmed that the total cost of the scheme is now £400m. (She is referring to Cleverly confirming earlier that two further payments of £50m were due. He did confirm what Cooper was asking. But it was not clear whether he was referring to two payments in 2024-25 and 2025-26, or whether he was referring to two payments in 2025-26 and 2026-27, which is how Cooper is interpreting his comments. Cooper just asked about payments in the calendar years 2025 and 2026, not payments in the financial years. See 12.56pm.) UPDATE: Cooper said: We have had a home secretary sacked, an immigration minister resigning, and they’ve spent almost £300m of taxpayers money on Rwanda without sending a single person, and the home secretary seemed to confirm today in fact that its is £400 million without a single person being sent. More home secretaries sent to Rwanda than asylum seekers, it’s about £100m per trip. The climate minister called back from the Dubai Cop for the vote – well I guess they can say at least one flight has taken off as a result of this legislation. Cleverly wraps up his speech by urging MPs to back the bill to create a fair asylum system. The Rwanda bill says it is up to ministers to decide whether or not they will ignore an injunction from the European court of human rights stopping a deportation flight leaving. Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former business secretary, asks if the advice from the attorney general says it would be compatible within international law for a minister to ignore such an injunction. Cleverly says he cannot reveal the attorney’s advice. But he says the government is clear that the bill is in accordance with international law. Cleverly says Rwanda is introducing an even stronger end-to-end asylum system. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, asks Cleverly to confirm that the UK will give Rwanda a further £50m in 2025 and another £50m in 2026. Cleverly claims Cooper is asking him to confirm numbers that have already been put in the public domain. He says he is happy to confirm that is the case. (Cleverly seems to be referring to the Home Office letter published last week, but that only revealed that the government had given another £100m to Rwanda this year, and that it was planning to give another £50m in 2024-25. But Cooper asked about a further payment of £50m in 2026, which Cleverly confirmed. That seems to be new, and would take the total payment to Rwanda by 2026 to £340m.) Cleverly says the supreme court’s judgment was based on the facts from 18 months ago. Those facts can be remedied, he says. The new treaty with Rwanda now sets out obligations on Rwanda and the UK within international law. Jeremy Wright (Con), a former attorney general, asks Cleverly to confirm that parliament does not have the power to deem itself in compliance with international law. He says no country should be able to just state it is within international law. He suggests the language of the bill needs to be clarified on this point. Cleverly says that is not the intention of the bill. The deeming clause is about the safety of Rwanda, he says. Joanna Cherry (SNP) asks, if Rwanda has addressed the problems raised by the supreme court, why is legislation necessary? Cleverly says the bill will make this clear and unambiguous. Sir Bill Cash (Con) asks Cleverly if he agrees that clear wording clearly establishing the intention of parliament takes precedence over international law. Cleverly says Cash is right. When the wording of a bill is clear and unambiguous, where there is a deeming cause, that must take precedence. Daniel Kawczynski (Con) says the Congolese president has described the president of Rwanda, Paul Kagame, as Hitler-like. Does the government agree? Cleverly says the UK government does not accept that assessment. John Baron (Con) asks Cleverly to confirm that the government will remain within international law. The British are world champions at queuing, we don’t like queue jumpers, which is why illegal immigration grates with us. Can he confirm that the government will take all steps to ensure that we remain within international law, just not now but going forward, in which case I will certainly be supporting the bill tonight. But does he also agree with me that some colleagues in this place need to be careful what they wish for? Cleverly says he is confident, on the basis of conversations with the government’s legal advisers, that what it is doing is “within the framework of international law”. But the measures are “novel”, and “very much pushing at the edge of the envelope”, he says. I am confident and indeed the conversations that I have had with the government’s legal advisors reinforces my belief that the actions that we are taking whilst novel, whilst very much pushing at the edge of the envelope, are within the framework of international law. James Cleverly, the home secretary, is opening the debate on the Rwanda bill. He starts by referring to the death of an asylum seeker on the Bibby Stockholm barge. He says he cannot go into details, but the case is being investigated, he says. He goes on: This government is stopping the boats. Arrivals are down by a third this year as illegal entries are on the rise elsewhere in Europe. Indeed arrivals are up by 80% in the Mediterranean, they are down by a third across the Channel. The Foreign Office has been in touch to say that David Cameron’s appearance at the European scrutiny committee today was cancelled at the committee’s request, not Cameron’s. (See 10.59am.) Last week Rishi Sunak suggested that, if he were to toughen the Rwanda bill by “an inch”, it would become unworkable (because it would no longer be acceptable to Rwanda). But now No 10 is sounding a little more receptive to possible changes to the bill. At the Downing Street lobby briefing, asked if Sunak still thought it would be impossible to make the bill stronger, the PM’s spokesperson said: We are willing to listen to constructive comments from colleagues. We believe this is a tough piece of legislation which will achieve its objectives and the public’s objectives of stopping the boats. The spokesperson said Downing Street would not be pulling the bill – which is what Mark Francois, chair of the European Research Group, has been saying should happen. (If No 10 was planning to pull the bill, it left it a bit late; the second reading debate is starting in about five minutes.) The spokesperson also confirmed that the climate change minister, Graham Stuart, has been ordered to return from the Cop28 summit in Dubai for tonight’s vote. Nick Brown, a former chief whip, has announced he is standing down as an MP at the next election – and resigning his party membership in protest at the way an allegation against him is being investigated. The MP for Newcastle upon Tyne East has had the whip suspended for more than a year after a complaint was lodged against him under the party’s independent complaints procedure. In a statement issued today via lawyers, Brown said the complaint was made by a political rival and related to something alleged to have happened more than 25 years ago. He also said the accusations were “entirely false”. Brown said that, when the complaint was first lodged, he was “determined to trust” the party’s disciplinary process. But, in his statement today, he said he had concluded that he was not getting a fair hearing because the party’s procedures were “flawed” and lacked “the most basic of procedural fairness and evidential safeguards”. He said disciplinary hearings were not taking place in person, that witnesses were not allowed to be questioned by lawyers, and that the panel was considering evidence from friends of the complainants who did not know anything about the allegation until the complainant mentioned it to them more than 20 years after it was supposed to have happened. He went on: My own legal team – which include a leading KC and a leading public law barrister – have told me that, in light of the party’s refusal to comply with even the most basic of safeguards, evidential and procedural measures to be expected of any quasi-judicial process, they are unable to advise me that I could expect a fair hearing. Things have reached a very sorry pass when the likely next party of government conducts cases of this gravity in a manner more akin to those of a mismanaged golf club. Brown was first elected to the Commons in 1983. He was (at least until last year) one of the great survivors of postwar politics, having served as Tony Blair’s chief whip when Blair was first PM, Gordon Brown’s chief whip in the final two years of the Labour government, and then chief whip again under Jeremy Corbyn and Keir Starmer. Including brief spells doing the job under Harriet Harman and Ed Miliband, he has served as chief whip under six Labour leaders. In his statement, Brown said that, at the age of 73, and with his constituency boundaries being withdrawn, he thought it was the right time to leave parliament. The Telegraph is also reporting claims that Rishi Sunak’s breakfast meeting at No 10 with Conservative MPs reluctant to vote for the Rwanda bill did not go well. It says: A former minister said: ‘Views seem to be hardening and more people are planning to vote against rather than abstain, but many will wait to decide later in the day.’ Another Tory source said: ‘[The meeting] didn’t go that well. Rishi was pointing finger at Boris [Johnson], Liz [Truss], Suella [Braverman] and Rob [Jenrick].’ Q: If the Rwanda bill does pass, how quickly would you repeal it? And if you are in power, will you guarantee not to send anyone to Rwanda. Starmer says he thinks the bill will go through tonight. The PM has an 80-seat majority. He says they should not allow the PM the indulgence of thinking it will be tight, and giving him credit if it wins. (Starmer is wrong. Boris Johnson had an 80-seat majority after the 2019 general election, but byelection defeats have reduced it considerably. The Commons website says the government currently has a working majority of 56.) He says he does not know what will happen to the bill after that. But, if Labour wins the election, it will focus on a more effective way of dealing with the problem. If the PM does lose, “of course he should call a general election”, he says. And that is the end of the Q&amp;A. This is what PA Media has filed on the death of an asylum seeker on the Bibby Stockholm barge. An asylum seeker onboard the Bibby Stockholm asylum barge has died, the PA news agency understands. The first asylum seekers were brought back to the giant vessel, moored in Portland, Dorset, in October, some two months after it was evacuated following the discovery of Legionella bacteria in the water supply. Further details of the incident are yet to be confirmed. Q: In your speech you implied Labour was on the wrong track under Ed Miliband. In that case, why is he serving in your shadow cabinet? Starmer says Miliband is a very good member of his shadow cabinet. But he was making the point that Labour’s problems did not start with Jeremy Corbyn, he says. They have lost four elections in a row. Q: Not a single graduate of Labour’s Bernie Grant leadership scheme has been selected as a candidate for the party. Is Labour doing enough on diversity? Starmer says the Bernie Grant scheme is a good one. He says not all selections have finished, but he says the party always needs to do more to promote diversity. Q: We have just heard an asylum seeker on the Bibby Stockholm has died. What is your reaction? Starmer says he is not aware of the story, but he expresses concern about the news. Q: Do you think a Rwanda-style scheme, sending people abroad and saying they cannot return, is immoral? Starmer says he does not think it will work. He says it is very expensive, and the wrong thing to do. Q: Are you just opposed to sending asylum seekers to Rwanda? Or are you against the principle of processiong asylum seekers in third countries altogether? Other countries are considering those plans. Starmer says the Rwanda scheme will not work. He says other countries process asylum seekers somewhere else, normally on the way to the country. He says he would consider any scheme that might work. But he says the Rwanda scheme is not like those schemes. It is a straightforward deportation scheme, he says. Q: You did not make stopping the boats one of your five priorities. So voters will conclude you are not serious about this issue, won’t they? Starmer does not accept that. He says securing the borders is an essential task for government. It is fundamental, he says. He says the five missions are about how he wants to change the UK. Q: Will you really write off the £240m spent on the Rwanda scheme? Starmer says that money has already been spent. It has been wasted. Rwanda saw us coming, he says. Q: You talked about changing Labour. At what point did you realise it was on the wrong track under Jeremy Corbyn. Starmer says he did not vote for Corbyn in 2015 or in 2016. But, in the Brexit crisis, he felt he had a responsibility to serve the party as Brexit spokesperson. But he says Corbyn will not be a Labour candidate again. That shows how much the party has changed. Q: Do you think you can stop the boats. Or do you think that is an impractical promise? Starmer says he does really want to stop the boats. Keir Starmer is now taking questions at the end of his speech. Q: Are you opposed to the Rwanda bill because you think it won’t work, or is it because you think the bill is immoral? Starmer says Labour is voting against it for a number of reasons: it won’t work, it will cost a fortune, and it is against Labour values. But that does not mean he does not want to stop the boats, he says. He does. Steven Swinford from the Times has been tweeting on the latest on the potential Tory revolt over the Rwanda bill. Tories on the right have been doing the numbers on this evening’s vote and early indications suggest they don’t have the numbers. Senior Tory MP: ‘Some of our colleagues have deluded themselves into thinking the govt will make the necessary changes at report stage. They won’t’ Inside Rishi Sunak’s No 10 breakfast with Tory right-wingers: * Danny Kruger opened – he told the PM he had 3 options. Pull the bill, commit to making amendments in unequivocal terms from despatch box or refuse to make changes &amp; people will vote against * Rishi Sunak said he wouldn’t pull bill but said he would consider ‘tightening it up’ * Sunak said he had ‘inherited’ high levels of legal migration &amp; small boats issues - this irked some of those present * Jonathan Gullis said he &amp; colleagues had heard nothing from whips office or home sec. Said it felt like no-one cared about their view * Marco Longhi said there had been no meaningful engagement before publication of bill * Nick Fletcher said govt needs to be more Tory and stop being socialists. The PM said he’s a Tory, highlighted tax cuts * Some already swayed by PM’s offer to consider amendments – others think it’s not serious * PM, Will Tanner, Rupert Yorke &amp; Craig Williams in room for govt – no sign of chief whip David Cameron’s hearing with the European scrutiny committee, which was due to take place at 2pm, has been postponed, the committee has said. It hasn’t said why, but the new foreign secretary would not be the first person to feel less than enthusiastic about the prospect of spending an afternoon discussing European treaties with Sir Bill Cash, the committee’s chair. UPDATE: The Foreign Office has been in touch to say it was the committee that cancelled today’s hearing, not Cameron. Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, a former lord chief justice of England and Wales, has said the government should not try to ignore the jurisdiction of the European court of human rights. In an interview for a podcast called the Judges, he said: If you have subjected yourself to a court, and it was our voluntary decision to do so, then you have to take the rough with the smooth and if they’ve decided [the court] have this jurisdiction then you ought to follow it. You can’t expect others to respect the law if you say you won’t respect the law of someone else. Thomas also said the only way to resolve the asylum crisis was to ensure claims are considered quickly, with refugees only allowed one right of appeal. He said: You ought to actually be able, within a set period of time, say a fortnight, to investigate, decide, give him one right of appeal – why you should have more than one right of appeal I simply don’t understand – and remove them.” But, he concedes, it costs money. Keir Starmer is now delivering a speech in Silverstone. According to the extracts released in advance, he will urge voters to “turn the page on this miserable chapter of decline” and elect a Labour administration capable of delivering competent government. Referring to small boats, he will say: Britain is a practical nation – always has been. People can’t afford Christmas. If they call an ambulance this winter – they don’t know if it will come. 6,000 crimes go unpunished - every day. Common sense is rolling your sleeves up and solving these problems practically, not indulging in some kind of political performance art. This goes for stopping the boats as well. It’s not about wave machines, or armoured jet skis, or schemes like Rwanda you know will never work. It’s about doing the basics better. The mundane stuff. The bureaucratic stuff. Busting the backlogs. Rebuilding a functioning asylum system. Removing people more quickly so you don’t have to run up hotel bills. And cross-border police force that can smash the smuggler gangs at source. I’ve done this before as director of public prosecutions when we took on the terrorists and the people-smugglers. We can do the same here. Stopping the boats means stopping the gimmicks. If they can’t find a way to do that, if they can’t find a way to focus on the job, fix our problems without breaking international law like every government before them, then it’s time to stand aside and let the Labour party do it for them. Here is Ben Quinn’s preview of the speech. Parliament’s joint committee on human rights, which is cross-party and chaired by Labour’s Harriet Harman, has published its own briefing on the human rights concerns raised by the Rwanda bill. (It is described as the “chair’s briefing paper”, but the press release implies its a briefing from the whole committee.) The briefing argues that the bill is “inconsistent” with the European convention on human rights. It says: The bill would require all domestic courts to accept that Rwanda is safe and not to consider any review or appeal brought on the grounds that it is not – even if there is compelling evidence in support. This raises difficult constitutional questions about the separation of powers and the rule of law. It would prevent the courts considering arguable claims that removal to Rwanda is unsafe, which would expose individuals to a risk of their fundamental rights not to be subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment being violated, and is inconsistent with the right to an effective remedy guaranteed under article 13 ECHR [European convention on human rights]. The requirement that all decision-makers conclusively treat Rwanda as safe applies notwithstanding laws including key provisions of the Human Rights Act. This would permit public authorities to act incompatibly with convention rights, which would be inconsistent with the UK’s obligations under the ECHR. Disapplying the HRA in respect of a particular cohort runs contrary to the fundamental principle that human rights are universal. While the bill can alter domestic law, parliament cannot legislate away the UK’s obligations in international law including the prohibition on refoulement under the Refugee Convention and the ECHR. Under the ECHR, any individual who is selected for removal to Rwanda is able to make an application to the European court of human rights (ECtHR) and the UK will be bound by that court’s judgment. \\uf0b7 The ECtHR has the power to issue interim measures, effectively an order requiring states to refrain from taking certain action while a human rights claim is considered. They have done so previously, preventing the initial flights to Rwanda. The bill would provide that a minister, and only a minister, may choose whether or not to comply with interim measures. Since interim measures have been held to be binding under the ECHR, this provision purports to permit a minister to act in breach of international law. The public law professor Mark Elliott has a good thread on X about the report. It starts here. One Conservative MP who met Sunak at the breakfast meeting said afterwards that he still had to make up his mind on whether he would support the bill and needed to get a second opinion on “legal technicalities” from barristers. Jonathan Gullis, a member of the New Conservatives grouping, told TalkTV: I still have those concerns that we will end up being bogged down by individual claims that means we will see very few people put on a plane to Rwanda. As the former immigration minister Robert Jenrick has said, we don’t want one or two token flights with five to 10 people. We need to see planes full to the hilt flying off to Rwanda, and then, I hope other safe countries. (If Gullis wants more on the “legal technicalities”, he could start by reading the various reports posted in the reading list at 10.08am.) At its core the debate between supporters and opponents of the Rwanda bill, at least within the Conservative party, is about whether or not the UK parliament can and should ignore international law. But the details get quite complicated, and if you want to follow the debate in its complexity, here are some documents that are helpful. Bill material The 12-page text of the bill A briefing from the House of Commons library explaining what the bill does Legal analysis – supportive The government’s own legal assessment of the bill A briefing from the Society of Conservative Lawyers Legal analysis – critical The analysis from the European Research Group’s “star chamber” A research note from the Policy Exchange thinktank (which is not as critical as the ERG analysis, and urges MPs to support the bill, but also proposes amendments) Legal analysis – from academic lawyers An analysis for the Institute for Government from Tom Hickman, a professor of public law A report on the bill from the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law by Murray Hunt, a visiting professor of human rights law More than 90 organisations and charities including Unison, the Muslim Council of Britain and Liberty have signed a joint statement describing the Rwanda bill as immoral and against international law. “It does nothing to properly address the court’s concerns about the Rwandan asylum system and removing our domestic courts’ jurisdiction to consider the issue. It is an abuse of parliament’s role,” the organisations said in a briefing coordinated by Freedom from Torture. The organisations called on MPs to voice their opposition to the bill, warning it would cause a constitutional crisis “by interfering with the separation of powers, seeking to overturn the evidence-based findings of fact, made not only by a court of competent jurisdiction, but in fact by the highest court in the UK, the supreme court”. Zoe Bantleman, the legal director at the Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association (ILPA), said: We are deeply concerned about the lengths to which the government is resorting, in their attempts to prevent people accessing refuge in the UK: legislating the legal fiction that Rwanda is safe, overriding the factual assessment of our supreme court, abusing parliament’s role in our constitution, breaching international law, and removing the ability of our courts and tribunals to scrutinise the lawfulness of the government’s conduct. Keir Starmer has dismissed the government’s Rwanda deportation policy as a gimmick. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he said: What I wouldn’t do, and what I won’t vote for, is £290m spent on a gimmick that is the Rwanda scheme, that won’t work, at the very most will take about 100 people – we’ve got 160,000 people waiting for their asylum claims to be processed, so it’s a drop in the ocean. It costs a fortune and, as we learnt from the prime minister when he finally admitted it last week, the deal be struck will also involve Rwanda sending their refugees across to the United Kingdom. It’s a gimmick, it won’t work, it is performance art. What I would do is do the more mundane, sleeves-rolled-up, practical work to stop this vile trade in the first place. Michael Tomlinson, the new minister for illegal migration, has been giving interviews this morning. Defending the provision in the Rwanda bill that will allow some appeals against deportation to continue (even though the bill is intended to close most routes to a successful appeal), Tomlinson told the Today programme blocking all right to appeal would be unBritish. He said: We have shut out virtually every single claim that is possible. What is not possible is to shut out every single claim. Nor would that be right, for two reasons. Firstly, it would breach international law. That is not the right thing to do. Secondly, because it is not the British thing to do. Even during the second world war did we not shut out claims going to court. Ben Quinn has the full story here. Good morning. Rishi Sunak and his team will spend the day trying to win round Conservative MPs unsure whether to support his Rwanda deportation bill before the vote at 7pm tonight. He has already held a breakfast meeting with some of the most intransigent potential rebels, but there is no evidence (yet?) that he had much success; as they left, they would not talk to the media. Ahead of what may be the most important parliamentary vote of Sunak’s premiership, here is our overnight preview by Kiran Stacey and Rajeev Syal. And these are from the BBC’s Henry Zeffman, who has been broadcasting from Downing Street this morning. And this is from PA Media: The MPs said nothing as they left Downing Street. None answered when asked by reporters if they had been persuaded by Rishi Sunak. They left together just after 8.30am. It seems more likely than not – but not certain – that Sunak will win the vote tonight. A government has not lost a bill at second reading since 1986, when the shops bill (which would have allowed Sunday trading) was defeated by Labour and rebel Tory MPs who wanted to protect Sunday as a day of rest. The issue was relatively marginal, and Margaret Thatcher went on to win a general election handsomely the following year. But, for Sunak, “stopping the boats” is a core mission for his government and, without this bill, he would no longer have a plan at all. A defeat would be utterly disastrous, and no one knows where that might lead. But, even if Sunak wins, that will probably just mean the key battle on this legislation being postponed until MPs vote on amendments, after Christmas. One way or the other, by the end of the day we’ll have a clearer insight into just how perilous this row is for the Sunak administration. I’ll mostly be focusing on this story today, although we also have a big speech from Keir Starmer this morning that I’ll be covering in detail. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Rishi Sunak chairs cabinet. 10.30am: Keir Starmer gives a speech near Milton Keynes. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. After 12.30pm: MPs begin the debate on the second reading of the safety of Rwanda (immigration and asylum) bill. 2pm: David Cameron gives evidence as foreign secretary to the Commons European scrutiny committee. 7pm: MPs vote on the Rwanda bill.

       "     'bodyText': 'Late on Tuesday afternoon, a couple of dozen Conservative rightwingers hustled into the Wilson Room in Portcullis House, parliament’s modern extension. There were two goals for the meeting. Ostensibly, it was to agree how they would vote in Tuesday night’s crunch vote on the Rwanda bill – a moment they knew could define Rishi Sunak’s premiership. But there was also a second reason for meeting so close the vote itself: to make sure that after a frantic 36 hours of lobbying by the prime minister and his officials, the members of the loose affiliation of Tory MPs would not falter at the last and vote in favour of the bill. Members emerged minutes before the voting began, with representatives from five major backbench groups – dubbed the five families after the New York mafia – announcing they would not support the bill. The meeting, and the subsequent dramatic walk down to the chamber of the House of Commons to vote, capped an extraordinary two days in Westminster which saw internal Tory battles play out publicly in a way not seen since the Brexit wars of 2017-19. In the end, enough Tory MPs abstained to give the prime minister a bloody nose without defeating the bill. “This has been the Brexit battles all over again,” said one Conservative MP. “It’s the same arguments, the same groups, the same people leading them.” The problems for the prime minister began almost as soon as he published the Rwanda bill, a piece of legislation designed to bypass legal objections to his flagship policy to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda. The bill’s publication was promptly followed by the resignation of Sunak’s immigration minister Robert Jenrick, who was one of those to rebel on Tuesday night. But the prime minister knew the fate of the bill rested not with Jenrick or even his former boss Suella Braverman, both of whom are now vying to be figureheads for the anti-immigration right. Instead Sunak had to wait anxiously for the verdict of the “star chamber” – a panel of two MPs and two lawyers chaired by the veteran Eurosceptic Bill Cash, whose advice dozens of Tory MPs said they would follow in deciding whether to vote for the bill. On Monday afternoon a small group of MPs from each of the major rightwing backbench groups had met in another conference room in Portcullis House to discuss the star chamber’s verdict and their response. Those in the room say they were surprised at how definitive the star chamber advice was. The bill was “partial and incomplete”, according to a 10-page conclusion, and would not be fit for purpose without “very significant amendments”. Mark Francois, the ebullient chair of the European Research Group and another veteran of the Brexit-era party battles, took those attending through the various options. Members could vote for the bill and push for amendments, or they could abstain or vote against and risk it collapsing altogether. The option which won the most support from those there, according to people in the meeting, was to urge Sunak to withdraw the bill altogether and rework it with their input. “The bill, because of the shape of it, because of its style, its legal structure would be quite difficult to amend,” Francois told the media afterwards. “It would be far better to withdraw the bill and come up with something which is much better written right from the word go.” His words were a direct message to those in Downing Street: he and his allies were willing to vote against the bill, even if it meant this version collapsing. Later that afternoon however, the other wing of the Tory party decided to do some organising of its own. Members of the One Nation caucus met on the same corridor as their colleagues had just hours earlier to agree their own warning to the prime minister: if he amended the bill in any major way, they would vote it down. Sunak now faced a dilemma. He could bow to one group of his backbenchers, but not to both. Worse for the prime minister, the position of the rightwing MPs appeared to harden as the evening wore on. “I was willing to vote for this bill and try to amend it,” one told the Guardian on Monday night. “But the more I think about it, the more I think it is unamendable.” Early on Tuesday morning, over bacon sandwiches and pastries in Downing Street, just over a dozen MPs, mostly members of the rightwing New Conservatives group, laid out their demands. Danny Kruger, the group’s co-chair, told Sunak he could pull the bill, as suggested by Francois, make clear in public he would make major amendments at a later stage, or risk a major rebellion. In response Sunak told them he was willing to make amendments, but only “within the framework of the bill”. The reception in the room to Sunak’s message was mixed, according to one person there. But among other groups outside, already angry at not being invited to the breakfast, they went down like a cup of cold sick. “Amendments within the framework of the bill are not going to be enough,” said one backbench MP. “The star chamber analysis made clear, we need a major rethink.” As the afternoon progressed, the debate started in the Commons. Government whips were relieved that many of those who spoke against the bill indicated they were willing to vote for it. Nick Fletcher, one of the New Conservatives to attend the Downing Street breakfast, told MPs in the afternoon: “We’ve got friends on this side of the house who want this bill stronger and I’m going to work with them … because we must make this work, we have to stop the boats.” Sunak, however, was taking no chances, speaking to MPs in Downing Street one-on-one in an effort to pick off potential rebels. Some on the Tory benches believed the “five families” never wanted to kill off the bill at all, but wanted to engineer enough of a rebellion to persuade the prime minister they had the power to vote it down if he did not amend it as they wanted. Whether it was Sunak’s last-minute lobbying push that whittled down numbers, or whether it was always the intention of rightwing MPs to stop short of killing the bill altogether, that is exactly what happened. Government sources say they expect the bill to come back to parliament for future debates in early January, when pressure from rightwingers will mount once more to amend the bill. Sunak has the Christmas break to decide whether he wants to face them down once more, or this time turn against the centrists.'},\n",

       "     'bodyText': 'As the storm clouds gathered over Westminster on Tuesday afternoon, one of Rishi Sunak’s cabinet ministers looked up at the heavy grey sky and sighed: “It’s pathetic fallacy.” Yet despite the dark mood among the prime minister’s allies – and grim warnings to the contrary – the first stage of his flagship Rwanda bill passed easily through the House of Commons. Sunak spent the day trying to convince would-be rebels to vote for the legislation, starting with a pre-dawn meeting at No 10 where he told the rightwing New Conservative group of MPs that he wouldn’t pull the bill but was willing to discuss “tightening” it. The Tory MPs were not all convinced, with some of those present questioning whether the government could amend the legislation at later stages when Sunak had suggested he could not move “an inch” for fear of the Rwanda deal collapsing. Downing Street said the government was in “listening” mode, prompting one senior backbench rebel to complain that the prime minister was, in fact, in “transmit but not receive” mode in the determination not to make any substantial changes. The One Nation group of centrist Tory MPs had already said it would back the law on the condition that Sunak made no concessions. One former minister suggested there was “a lot of shouting” from the right but predicted the bill would go through. The Tory whips weren’t taking any chances, with a three-line whip, pairing and slips cancelled, and foreign trips scrapped. Climate minister Graham Stuart was summoned back from Cop28 in Dubai before the fraught negotiations there had completed. Some Tory MPs even claimed they had been threatened with losing the whip. One senior Conservative, a Sunak loyalist, denied the government was panicking but admitted: “I’ve been be very clear with my colleagues, it’s either this bill or Labour wins the election.” Just 29 Tories needed to vote against, or 57 abstain, for the Rwanda bill to fall. If it had, it would have been the first second reading vote lost by a government since 1986 – and an extraordinary humiliation for Sunak. The meetings with different factions of Tory MPs continued throughout the day, with the location moving to Sunak’s Commons office as the vote approached. Rebels said he was “pulling out all the stops”, even holding some one-to-ones with wavering MPs. But as the debate continued in the chamber, the nerves in Downing Street abated. Some of the fiercest critics of the legislation, including former immigration minister Robert Jenrick, indicated they would abstain for now and then try to amend the bill at a later date. Others in the “five families” of the Tory right remained more sceptical, describing as “deluded” those colleagues who believed No 10 would meet their demands to toughen the bill once it returned to the Commons in early January. Keir Starmer, who has said a Labour government would repeal the legislation if the Rwanda law passes, warned against over-dramatising the vote given the scale of the Tory majority. “It will go through tonight I don’t doubt, with a lot of shouting and screaming but in the end it’ll go through,” he told reporters. “This is a government with a majority so I don’t think we should allow them the indulgence of pretending it is going to be tight.” Even though the legislation did make it past its first hurdle, Sunak remains in deep trouble. He has stoked a civil war within his party despite promising stability. He has raised public expectations he would tackle illegal migration yet has so far failed to deliver. The Conservative party’s obsession threatens to tear it apart. Sunak’s focus on small boats – which made up less than 4% of all immigration to the UK last year – looks tragically misdirected. He may have got through the vote, but this is just the beginning of this particular battle. The storm clouds are still gathering.'},\n",

       "     'bodyText': 'Rishi Sunak is engaged in a desperate lobbying push to persuade Conservative MPs to back his Rwanda bill as he hopes to avoid a defeat which could fatally undermine his authority. The prime minister will host an emergency breakfast in Downing Street with members of the rightwing New Conservative group of backbenchers on Tuesday in an effort to reassure wavering Tory MPs. The New Conservatives group are demanding “major surgery” or “replacement” of the government’s Rwanda bill. In a statement read out on Sky News, the group said more than 40 Tory MPs met in Richmond House, Westminster, to discuss the legislation. They added: “Every member of that discussion said that the bill needs major surgery or replacement and they will be making that plain in the morning to the prime minister at breakfast and over the next 24 hours.” Sky News is reporting that the group is split over how to vote on the bill tomorrow, with some wanting to abstain while others wish to vote against. Former immigration minister Robert Jenrick and former home secretary Suella Braverman were among those attending the meeting in backbencher Danny Kruger’s office, alongside senior MPs Simon Clarke and Jacob Rees-Mogg. However, the One Nation Tory MPs will vote for prime minister Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda legislation on Tuesday, the group said. Damian Green, speaking to reporters after the One Nation group meeting, warned that the government must “stick to its guns” on the current iteration of the Rwanda legislation. “We support the bill unamended, but if anyone brings forward any amendments that breach our international obligations or breach the rule of law, we vote against those amendments at future stages. “We will vote with the government tomorrow, but we want the government to stick to its guns and stick to the text of this bill,” he said. Damian Green, speaking to reporters after the One Nation group meeting, warned that the government must “stick to its guns” on the current iteration of the Rwanda legislation. “We support the bill unamended, but if anyone brings forward any amendments that breach our international obligations or breach the rule of law, we vote against those amendments at future stages. “We will vote with the government tomorrow, but we want the government to stick to its guns and stick to the text of this bill,” he said. Ministers are using an “outdated and flawed” Home Office analysis to persuade Conservative MPs to vote for Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda bill, informed party sources have said. Modelling distributed to MPs claims that 99.5% of individual legal challenges submitted by asylum seekers will fail to block their deportation to Rwanda. The document, entitled High Level Process for the New Bill and first disclosed in the Times, is being circulated by whips before the first vote on the bill in the Commons, due on Tuesday. Sir Matthew Rycroft, permanent secretary at the Home Office, has told MPs that in theory Rwanda could walk away from its deportation deal with the UK with £240m – the money it has received already – without having to accept a single asylum seeker. Giving evidence to the public accounts committee, Rycroft said if the UK instigated the break clause in the deal, Rwanda would keep the money already paid. But if Rwanda activated the break clause, the money would be repaid “proportionately”. Rishi Sunak has forcefully defended his record as chancellor during the Covid crisis, saying he did not need to consult scientists about the “eat out to help out” scheme, and that descriptions of the Treasury as being “pro-death” were deeply unfair. During five hours of often cautious evidence to the Covid inquiry, during which he repeatedly said he could not remember meetings, comments or other details, Sunak dismissed the idea he overrode scientific objections to his flagship hospitality scheme. In testimony punctuated by apparent lapses in memory, Sunak said he was unable to recall details of the meetings that imposed the first lockdown in March 2020, or whether he or other ministers had opposed extending free school meals to poorer children during holidays, a decision reversed after a campaign by the footballer Marcus Rashford. He also denied hearing anyone dismissing parents whose children needed free meals as “freeloaders”, a comment Vallance recorded in his diary as being made by someone in government during this debate. UK ministers have offered Northern Ireland a financial package that they say is worth £2.5bn on condition that the Stormont executive is revived. Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, made the offer at a roundtable meeting of party leaders on Monday against a backdrop of political deadlock, budget overruns and crumbling public services. The move will increase pressure on the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) to abandon a boycott of power-sharing that has paralysed the Stormont executive and assembly amid a mounting fiscal crisis. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, and indeed the UK politics live blog for today. Thanks for following along. Rishi Sunak is engaged in a desperate lobbying push to persuade Conservative MPs to back his Rwanda bill as he hopes to avoid a defeat which could fatally undermine his authority. The prime minister will host an emergency breakfast in Downing Street with members of the rightwing New Conservative group of backbenchers on Tuesday in an effort to reassure wavering Tory MPs. Danny Kruger, the co-chair of the New Conservatives, was one of a number of senior Tories to warn on Monday that they did not support the bill in its current form. A Tory source said MPs would use the meeting to tell the prime minister that the bill needs “major surgery or replacement”. The No 10 breakfast follows a series of meetings on Monday involving ministers and factions from the right and left of the party on a day of frenetic activity in Westminster reminiscent of Brexit fights from 2017-2019. One person close to the talks described the government’s whipping operation as “belated, panicked and intense”. Sunak himself spent Monday testifying to the Covid-19 inquiry, but Downing Street dispatched the home secretary, James Cleverly, and the illegal migration minister Michael Tomlinson to hear MPs’ concerns. Cleverly said after the meeting: “We’re determined to get [the bill] through. It’s important legislation.” The New Conservatives group are demanding “major surgery” or “replacement” of the government’s Rwanda bill. In a statement read out on Sky News, the group said more than 40 Tory MPs met in Richmond House, Westminster, to discuss the legislation. They added: Every member of that discussion said that the bill needs major surgery or replacement and they will be making that plain in the morning to the prime minister at breakfast and over the next 24 hours. It refers to the fact that 20 of the group – on the right of the Conservative party – will be having breakfast with the prime minister on Tuesday morning. Sky News is reporting that the group is split over how to vote on the bill tomorrow, with some wanting to abstain while others wish to vote against. Former immigration minister Robert Jenrick and former home secretary Suella Braverman were among those attending the meeting in backbencher Danny Kruger’s office, alongside senior MPs Simon Clarke and Jacob Rees-Mogg. The former deputy prime minister Damian Green, representing the One Nation caucus of Tory MPs, is speaking to Sophy Ridge on Sky News. He tells the Politics Hub show: The sense of the meeting I was at … all those who were there agreed with this strategy of thus far and no further. We will not accept amendments that push it in a way that we regard as undesirable but we are prepared to vote tomorrow night with the government. Asked about potential amendments, he adds: I know that the government thinks this is the legislation that they want because they proposed it. They are publishing this evening their legal advice explaining why, written like this, the bill is legal. It seems to me that the sensible things for anyone to do, left or right of the party, is to support the government. We all want to stop the boats, we all think that the Rwanda scheme will act as a deterrent for that, so it seems the sensible thing to do is to get on with this as fast as possible. Damian Green, speaking to reporters after the One Nation group meeting, warned that the government must “stick to its guns” on the current iteration of the Rwanda legislation. “We support the bill unamended, but if anyone brings forward any amendments that breach our international obligations or breach the rule of law, we vote against those amendments at future stages. “We will vote with the government tomorrow, but we want the government to stick to its guns and stick to the text of this bill,” he said. One Nation Tory MPs will vote for prime minister Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda legislation on Tuesday, the group has said. Damian Green is expected to make a statement in front of the cameras shortly. Elsewhere, UK ministers have offered Northern Ireland a financial package that they say is worth £2.5bn on condition that the Stormont executive is revived. Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, made the offer at a roundtable meeting of party leaders on Monday against a backdrop of political deadlock, budget overruns and crumbling public services. The move will increase pressure on the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) to abandon a boycott of power-sharing that has paralysed the Stormont executive and assembly amid a mounting fiscal crisis. The package would include a new funding formula for public services and a lump sum to settle pay claims that have led to industrial action by education, health and transport workers. Martin Vickers, the MP for Cleethorpes, has just been speaking about the upcoming Rwanda legislation vote on Sky News. He told The News Hour with Mark Austin that he expects the bill to pass through the Commons tomorrow, adding: I would very much hope that is the case. I’ve been in meetings all afternoon so I haven’t actually caught up with the various reports that are coming from different meetings but either way, whichever side of the argument you are on, let’s get it through its second reading and debate any changes we want at a later stage. Asked if prime minister Rishi Sunak is right to be putting his premiership on the line over this issue, Vickers said: Well, strictly speaking, he hasn’t because it’s been made clear that it isn’t a vote of confidence. There are big ifs here but if there were a defeat tomorrow then a vote of confidence would probably follow, which he would win overwhelmingly. Vickers added that he “sincerely hopes” flights to Rwanda would take off before the next general election, adding that it is what his Cleethorpes constituents – as well “most of the British people” – would like to see happen. Around 20 Tory MPs are attending a meeting convened by the New Conservatives to discuss the Rwanda legislation, PA reports. Former immigration minister Robert Jenrick and former home secretary Suella Braverman were among those attending, alongside senior MPs Simon Clarke and Jacob Rees-Mogg. Danny Kruger, who leads the New Conservative grouping, welcomed MPs into his office on the parliamentary estate from 6pm onwards. Two groups of Conservative MPs are meeting, separately, about now to discuss the Rwanda bill. The rightwing European Research Group is holding a meeting with Robert Jenrick, who resigned as immigration minister over the bill. Jenrick has said he cannot support the bill as it is now, but he has not said he will vote against tomorrow, implying he will abstain. The chair of the ERG, Mark Francois, has said that he wants the bill pulled (see 2.50pm) and he has also said that the ERG may not give its collective view on how its members should vote until the last minute (see 12.56pm). The centrist One Nation Caucus is also meeting, and we are expecting to hear how its members are likely to vote later. The One Nation Caucus has more than 100 members and so, in theory, it ought to be a much more powerful body in the party than the ERG, whose members number a few dozen. But in practice it doesn’t work like that. The ERG are zealots and ideologues, while the One Nationers are pragmatists. The One Nation lot believe that willingess to compromise is virtue; on the ERG side, it’s seen as a vice, or selling out. The former Tory cabinet minister Rory Stewart described the difference perfectly in his brilliant memoir, Politics on the Edge. Referring to meetings of a One Nation group during the Brexit years, and how they measured up against their Brexiter opponents, he said: “We felt like a book club going to a Millwall game.” That’s all from me for tonight. Tom Ambrose is taking over now. Sir Matthew Rycroft, permanent secretary at the Home Office, has told MPs that in theory Rwanda could walk away from its deportation deal with the UK with £240m – the money it has received already – without having to accept a single asylum seeker. Giving evidence to the public accounts committee, Rycroft said if the UK instigated the break clause in the deal, Rwanda would keep the money already paid. But if Rwanda activated the break clause, the money would be repaid “proportionately”. That prompted Meg Hillier, chair of the committee, to say: So they could still have the money with having perhaps not had to receive a single asylum seeker. Rycroft replied: “It would depend on the circumstances.” Ministers are using an “outdated and flawed” Home Office analysis which claims 99.5% of legal challenges to the Rwanda bill would fail (see 9.25am) to persuade Conservative MPs to vote for it, informed party sources have said. Rajeev Syal and Pippa Crerar have the story. Christopher Hope from GB News says Tory whips are in a panic about tomorrow’s vote Senior Tory MPs tell me the whips have a problem with their backbenchers ahead of tomorrow’s Rwanda vote. One says trust was eroded in last week’s infected blood defeat, and colleagues are not being straight with the whips any more. Another MP: “The whips are wetting themselves.” In a thread on X, the Covid Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group says Rishi Sunak should resign. It starts here. Rishi Sunak, or as the Chief Medical Officer called him, ‘Dr Death the Chancellor’ has a catalogue of failures to answer for, from the ‘Eat Out To Help Out the Virus’ policy to refusing financial support for care workers to stop the spread of Covid between care homes. And it concludes: In a pandemic, public health relies on public confidence in decision makers. Rishi Sunak was and continues to be a public health hazard, and for the sake of our safety, he must resign. For much of this year it was assumed that Rishi Sunak’s evidence to the Covid inquiry would be a big, and difficult, moment for him. In the event, for the most part, he got through it fairly easily, on a day when what was happening elsewhere in London was much more relevant to the future of his premiership. The parallel is not exact, it was a bit like that afternoon Boris Johnson spent the afternoon answering questions about council funding at the liaison committee as cabinet ministers were queuing up in Downing Street waiting to tell him to quit. Sunak was at his most tetchy when asked to defend “eat out to help out”, and for many people his biggest weakness will be his claim not to have access to his old WhatsApp messages. (See 10.42am.) There were times when, like other witnesses, he showed himself susceptible to Covid inquiry memory loss, but at other times he was remarkably well briefed on the issue at hand. If his main aim was to convince Lady Hallett that he was not a “let rip” opponent of all public health measures, then he probably succeeded. When Hugo Keith KC put it to him that he was “violently opposed to a lockdown”, Sunak replied: “I think that’s not a fair characterization of my position.” Perhaps what was most surprising about Sunak’s evidence was his determination to defend Johnson against claims that his decision making in No 10 chaotic. The evidence to back this charge has been overwhelming. When Sunak resigned in the summer of 2022, he said it was because under Johnson the government was not being run “properly, competently and seriously”. At that point he made a virtue of being very different from Johnson. But today he claimed (not very convincingly) not to be aware that officials working in No 10 for Johnson thought it was all a shambles (see 11.46am) and he even endorsed the Johnson argument that what Dominic Cummings called trolleying was just a robust means of testing alternative propositions. This was also an answer where the two stories of the day melded. At one point it was easier for Sunak to disown Johnson. But the Tory MPs – and the newspapers – causing him most trouble in the Commons over Rwanda are also those most enthusiastic about his predecessor bar one, and today probably wasn’t the day to wind them up. At the Covid inquiry Sunak says he did not see any evidence that higher payments for people who had to isolate when they were sick would increase compliance with Covid rules. But he said the Treasury set up a £500 support scheme anyway. Q: The scheme had very low take-up. Yes, says Sunak. Take-up was around a fifth. Q: Was that because it was run by local authorities? Sunak says there was no clear alternative. The only alternative was getting the Deparment of Work and Pensions to make those payments, but that would have required primary legislation, and DWP did not have a delivery mechanism, he says. That is the end of Sunak’s evidence. Lady Hallett says that is the end of the oral evidence for module two. But she stresses that oral evidence is only part of the evidence she considers. The Society of Conservative Lawyers has issued its own briefing on the Rwanda bill. The 10-page paper by Lord Sandhurst KC and Harry Gillow and it comes down in favour of the bill. Here is the conclusion. While the Rwanda bill does allow individual challenges and there is the possibility of delay by the courts, our view is that the objectives of the MEDP [migration and economic development partnership – the Rwanda deal] are met better by the Rwanda Bill as drafted than the proposed alternative approaches. In particular, so far as the MEDP’s objectives are concerned, the approach in the Rwanda Bill is far preferable to one that runs a serious risk of collapsing the scheme in its entirety ultimately a political question and the importance of clause 5 [allowing ministers to ignore European court of human rights’ injunctions] is to prevent interference by UK courts (notwithstanding that there would be no basis on which to do so in any case). As recently reported, France appears to have ignored an order from the European court of human rights not to deport an individual to Uzbekistan, an important development in respect of wider attitudes to the ECHR among signatory states. Second, our view is that clause 5 in essence simply states the constitutional position, that the ECHR (including, therefore, Rule 39 orders) have no binding effect as a matter of domestic UK law, and it is for the executive (given prerogative powers to conduct foreign affairs) to decide how to respond. While there is nothing preventing parliament constraining the prerogative powers of the executive to act in this field, it would nevertheless be an unusual step, particularly where, as here, ministers are better placed to make a case-by-case assessment than parliament would be. Accordingly, we at present consider that imposing a duty to ignore Rule 39 orders would be inadvisable. We consider that insofar as there are concerns about whether ministers will comply with Rule 39 orders, this is best resolved through political pressure, rather than binding legislation. The European Research Group, in its legal paper on the bill (see 1.22pm), said the bill should require ministers to ignore ECtHR injunctions – the proposal described by the Society of Conservative Laywers as “inadvisable”. Leslie Thomas KC, counsel for the Federation of Ethnic Minority Healthcare Organisations (FEMHO), asked Sunak if he accepted that he exacerbated health inequalities by putting minority ethnic workers in a position where they had to work in environments where they were at risk of infection. Sunak did not accept that. He said the “eat out to help out scheme” protected people’s jobs. Rajiv Menon KC, who represents charities for children, is asking the questions now. He asks Sunak to accept the government was wrong to initially refuse to back Marcus Rashford’s call for poorer pupils to get free school meals during the holidays. Sunak says the government did eventually fund the programme. Q: Did you personally oppose this idea? Sunak says that even when the pandemic supported ended, permanent programmes were put in place that were more generous than what had gone before. Q: In his diary, Sir Patrick Vallance recalls someone saying: “Good working people pay for their children to eat and we don’t want freeloaders.” Sunak says that was not him. And he says he did not hear anyone saying that. Claire Mitchell KC, on behalf of Scottish Covid bereaved, shows the inquiry an excerpt from a letter from Nicola Sturgeon to the PM sent in September 2020 saying Scotland did not have enough financial autonomy to finance its own health measures. Sunak repeats the point he made in relation to Wales about how as chancellor he gave the devolved administrations more flexibility. Gowman shows another extract from Drakeford’s statement, in which he claims that Treasury was acting on behalf of England, not the whole of the UK. Again, Sunak says he does not accept this. He repeats the point about how allowed devolved adminstrations to get Barnett money earlier than normal. (See 3.45pm.) Gowman shows an extract from the witness statement from Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister. He said Wales could have implemented its circuit breaker lockdown earlier if it had been guaranteed financial support. Sunak does not accept this point. He says the UK government set up a special procedure during Covid to allow devolved adminstrations to access Barnett money (their equivalent for money going to England) early. At the Covid inquiry, Rishi Sunak is now beinq questioned by Nia Gowman, counsel for Covid Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru. She asks if the Welsh government had the option of opting out of the “eat out to help out” scheme. Sunak says the Welsh government never asked to opt out of scheme. Q: Doesn’t that show that they weren’t consulted? Sunak says it was a matter for Westminster; he says there was no reason to consult the Welsh government about it. But they did not object, he says. Scotland’s first minister, Humza Yousaf, has accused the new foreign secretary, David Cameron, of being “really petty and frankly misguided” after he threatened to withdraw Foreign Office support for Scottish ministers in an ongoing row about the SNP government’s international outreach. Cameron wrote to the Scottish government warning it was a breach of protocol after Yousaf discussed the Gaza conflict and other matters with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, at the Cop28 summit without UK officials. Yousaf’s response on Monday morning came after briefings that Cameron wanted to take a “harder line” with the Scottish government than his predecessor, James Cleverly, who issued a similar threat after Yousaf met the Icelandic prime minister in August in New York, also without UK diplomats present. Dismissing the intervention from an “unelected lord”, Yousaf said: Scotland is the part of the UK, outside of London, that has attracted the most foreign direct investment for eight years in a row. That happens because the Scottish government’s international engagement is valued [and] has impact. To threaten to curtail that, to stop that international engagement – the international engagement from the elected Scottish government from an unelected lord – I think is misguided and petty. Yousaf has of course been outspoken in his calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, making often emotional pleas when his own in-laws were trapped under blockade for several weeks. But Cameron’s letter is understood to evidence ongoing disquiet about Yousaf’s position in contrast to current UK government policy. Back at the Covid inquiry, Hugo Keith KC is now asking Rishi Sunak about claims that the Treasury was seen as the “pro-death” squad. Sunak says he was not aware of that. And he says that is not a “fair characterisation”. I do not think it is a fair characterisation on the incredibly hardworking people that I was lucky to be supported by at the Treasury. Keith said officials in No 10 described the Treasury as the “pro-death squad”, but he did not mention the fact that Boris Johnson himself used the term. At an earlier hearing the inquiry was read an extract from Sir Patrick Vallance’s diary which said: The PM is on record as saying that he wants tier 3, 1 March; tier 2, 1 April; tier 1, 1 May; and nothing by September, and he ends up by saying the team must bring in ‘the pro-death squad from HMT’. Mark Francois, the chair of the European Research Group, has suggested the government should pull its Rwanda bill and produce a new version before the second reading vote. (See 2.11pm.) He told GB News: This bill means that individuals can keep tying the government up in legal knots. That’s why it needs to be redrafted. The bill, because of the shape of it, because of its style, its legal structure would be quite difficult to amend. I very much hope that, rather than plough on and damn the torpedoes, the government will listen, exercise common sense, pull the legislation and come back with something that is fit for purpose. We’ve had two previous legislative attempts at this. The nationalities and borders bill that didn’t quite work, the illegal immigration bill that didn’t quite work. This really is the last chance so the government would be well advised to get it right. Keith asks Sunak about a line in the Spectator interview where Sunak said, referring to Sage: “If you empower all these independent people, you’re screwed.” Sunak says he was referring to the need for policy decisions to be taken by politicians. And he suggests there may be a case for an economic counterpoint to Sage. Keith returns to the Spectator interview with Sunak published in the summer of 2022. He asks about a line in the article saying Covid policy “being decided by half-explained graphs cooked up by outside academics”. Sunak says those are not his words. Lady Hallett, the chair, tells Keith that justifying the phrase is a question for the author, the Spectator editor Fraser Nelson. Sunak says he does want to make a point about Sage, the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. He says Sage’s views were presented as a consensus view. But people did not realise how much divergence there was on Sage, he says. Keith tells the inquiry that, while there is some evidence to suggest a link between use of the “eat out to help out” scheme and a rise in Covid cases, there is also other evidence showing that there was no correlation. But he asks why the scheme was not extended. Sunak says it was always intended to be temporary. At the Covid inquiry Rishi Sunak insists that the government’s main scientific adviser, Prof Sir Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, had the opportunity to raise concerns about the “eat out to help out” scheme with him. Sunak lists several meetings they attended, where they could have raised the topic but didn’t. Hugo Keith KC said in their evidence Whitty and Vallance said they were not specifically consulted about this. If they had been, they would have advised against, he says. UPDATE: Sunak said: It’s precisely in those three meetings that you mentioned; Covid-S on 16th July, the chief medical officer, in the minutes, talked about two significant risk moments: schools and winter. He did not mention Eat Out To Help Out. On the 22nd of July, the agenda item is August planning. And again, it was not raised by the chief scientific adviser or chief medical officer. On 6th August, the Covid-S meeting that you acknowledged, again, the minutes show that returning to schools was the single riskiest element of the government’s plan. Those three meetings all happened after the announcement of “eat out to help out”, all of them involve the chief scientific adviser and the chief medical officer. The government has just published a summary of its legal assessment of the Rwanda bill. And here is the summary at the end of the document. As set out above, the treaty, bill and evidence together demonstrate Rwanda is safe for relocated individuals, that the government’s approach is tough but fair and lawful, that it has a justification in the UK’s constitution and domestic law, and it seeks to uphold our international obligations. This is a novel and contentious policy, and the UK and Rwanda are the first countries in the world to enact it together. There are risks inherent in such an innovative approach but there is a clear lawful basis on which a responsible government may proceed. For the reasons set out in this paper, a bill that sought to oust all individual claims would not provide such a basis. This is not the same as the government’s internal legal advice, which is always kept private. At the Covid inquiry Hugo Keith KC is now asking directly about the “eat out to help out” scheme. Rishi Sunak says the scheme was designed to come into force when safe lifting of other measures had been approved. He says, without the scheme, many jobs would have been at risk “with devastating consequences”. The consensus at Westminster has been that Conservative MPs will vote through the Rwanda bill tomorrow. The government has a working majority of 56, which means (roughly) that for the government to lose tomorrow night, 57 of them would have to abstain, or 29 of them would have to vote against. No Tory MP has yet said publicly they intend to vote against, and if the rightwingers or centrists want to amend the bill, they have to give it a second reading first. But, according to Sky’s Beth Rigby, some ERG figures are now suggesting they would like to see the bill replaced altogether. They are not telling Sky they will vote down the bill, and to maximise their leverage it makes sense for them to keep No 10 guessing, but these comments do imply the bill might be in more jeopardy than previously assumed. Francois tells me the consensus in the room was to pull the bill and revise it &amp; come back to it. Mark Francois is ERG chair. And David Jones, ERG deputy chair, said he doesn’t think the bill amendable in its current form, as he explains why they want bill pulled. So position hardening. At the briefing by the European Research Group earlier, Mark Francois, the ERG chair, was asked how his group would vote on the Rwanda bill. He replied: You don’t always announce what you’re going to do well before the bell was ringing. The briefing was also attended by Danny Kruger, co-chair of the New Conservatives, another group for rightwing Tory MPs. He said: We’ll be discussing later with colleagues in light of the report that we’ve just received and having further conversations with government over the course of the next 24 hours. Other groups invited were the Common Sense Group, the Conservative Growth Group and the Northern Research Group. (In an act of mafia-chic hubris, some media reports have dubbed this lot the “five families”. But that may be more of a media invention than a term any of these Tories are using themselves. The memberships of the groups overlap a lot and it may be more helpful to think of them as just different iterations of the Tory right.) Rishi Sunak will want to know what the European Research Group is saying about his Rwanda bill. Here are the main conclusions from the 10-page document legal assessment of the bill produced by the ERG’s “star chamber”, led by Sir Bill Cash. (Bold text added by me.) The bill overall provides a partial and incomplete solution to the problem of legal challenges in the UK courts being used as stratagems to delay or defeat the removal of illegal migrants to Rwanda, for the following reasons. Most importantly, the bill contains no restrictions on the bringing of legal challenges against removal to Rwanda based on grounds other than that Rwanda is not a safe country. Many such individual claims have already been brought on a variety of other grounds, and it is to be expected that if the bill successfully blocks challenges based on contentions that Rwanda is not safe, then migrants and their advisers will focus more of their efforts on generating and pursuing challenges of other kinds. The restriction in the bill is only against pursuing claims that Rwanda is unsafe for migrants removed there in general. Clause 4(1) expressly preserves the possibility of legal challenges to removal based on arguments that a person’s individual circumstances may lead to them being subject to a risk of refoulement and ill treatment. The treaty is intended to address such concerns. However, by allowing individual claims, appeals, and injunctions, the statutory scheme is open to significant levels of legal challenge. Experience to date in cases about attempted removal of illegal migrants to Rwanda demonstrates that individual challenges are likely to be numerous, and that they have had a high rate of success. The bill’s threshold requirement for interim relief that there should be a risk of “serious and irreparable harm” is in practice much easier to surmount than the words might suggest, for example through the provision of medical statements of mental conditions which are not easy to prove or disprove (for example, suicidal ideation). There is a serious risk that there will be no, or very few, actual removals to Rwanda for months after the bill comes into force. Clause 5 of the bill deals with interim measures of the Strasbourg court (so-called “rule 39 indications”) by stating that a minister of the crown may decide not to comply with them. In our view this does no more than restate the existing legal position, since (1) there are compelling arguments that rule 39 indications do not give rise to an obligation in international law to comply with them, and (2) in any event Strasbourg court rulings do not of themselves create obligations which are enforceable under domestic UK law. Perversely, the inclusion of ministerial decisions relating to rule 39 indications in clause 5(2) of the bill might give rise to a possibility of bringing judicial reviews against such decisions which would not otherwise arise. It would be preferable if the bill were positively to require such interim indications [ECtHR injunctions] to be disregarded when UK courts refuse interim relief. The Covid inquiry has stopped for lunch. Rishi Sunak is off somewhere – no doubt to get briefed on the latest prouncement from the ERG. Back at the Commons, the ERG is meeting again tonight, ITV’s Carl Dinnen reports. The ERG and others won’t yet commit to how they plan to vote. They will meet again at 6pm to hear from Robert Jenrick. Back at the Covid inquiry Hugo Keith KC is now asking about the opening up measures planned for the summer. Rishi Sunak says the scheme was delayed at one point because of the concerns of the scientists. And he says asymptomatic transmission was not well understood at the time. Q: Are you saying at the end of June you were not aware that the plans were at the riskier end of the spectrum, and that real care would have to be taken. Sunak says he knew opening schools was a risk. But the European Research Group won’t say how it will advise its members to vote in the second reading debate tomorrow, Newsnight’s Nicholas Watt reports. Mark Francois is chair of the ERG. During Brexit, dozens of Tory MPs were members of the ERG and in most of the key Brexit votes they operated an informal whip and stuck to an agreed line (normally voting against Theresa May). But fewer MPs identify with the ERG now (the group will not divulge how many members it has), and even if the ERG leadership advises its members to vote a certain way, there is no guarantee they will comply. The Conservative European Research Group has been told by its legal “star chamber” that the government’s Rwanda bill is a “partial and incomplete solution” to the problem posed by small boats, Aubrey Allegretti from the Times reports. ERG Star Chamber says that Rwanda bill is a “partial and incomplete solution to the problem of legal challenges in the UK courts” to “delay or defeat the removal” of migrants UPDATE: Newsnight’s Nicholas Watt has posted the ERG announcement on X. Keith is edging towards “eat out to help out”. He shows the inquiry an extract from a Treasury memo from early May 2020 highlighting the importance of reopening hospitality. Sunak points out that the government wanted to open schools and non-essential retail first. He says there was quite a lot of resistance from schools about going back early. He says the Treasury’s input would have focused mostly on labour market issues. Opening schools has an impact on the labour market, because parents can return to work, he says. Keith shows Sunak a memo he was sent in April 2020, when the government was considering the timing of lifting lockdown measures. Here is one extract. But he focuses on this page, referring to the Treasury wanting the PM to see a document about the economy that has not been “watered down” by the Cabinet Office office. It is at line 3 b. Sunak says he did not write this. He says he is not sure what concerned his officials, but he says he never felt he could not express his views to the PM. At the Covid inquiry Rishi Sunak refers to a day during the early days of the Covid crisis when the government had a failed gilt auction. That meant the government was not able to borrow in the normal way on the money markets. It was a rare, and worrying, event. Hugo Keith KC says this happened at a time when the government was considering locking down London. Did that influence the decision? Sunak says he is not sure. That is a question for the PM. But he says this shows why he was doing such a difficult job. He says that day closing schools was proposed. The government acted. The government will publish a summary of its legal advice about the Rwanda bill, Pippa Crerar reports. She has just come out of the No 10 lobby briefing. NEW: No 10 says govt will published summary of legal advice on Rwanda bill today “in recognition of significant public interest”. Very unusual move, presumably intended to aid factions of Tory MPs studying bill. PM’s spox says still govt policy not to publish legal advice in full. The inquiry has resumed, and Hugo Keith KC is asking about the “behavioural fatigue” argument – the claim that introducing the first lockdown too soon would be mistake, because after a while people would get tired of complying. Rishi Sunak says he does not remember a lot about this debate. He says the Department of Health was on the lead on this. According to the Sun’s Jack Elsom, Rishi Sunak has invited Tory MPs considering rebelling over the Rwanda bill to breakfast tomorrow. Smoked salmon offensive! I hear Rishi Sunak has invited Tory Rwanda rebels in for a breakfast meeting tomorrow morning. If it’s the ERG lot, presumably he would do better offering them a Full English. The Covid inquiry has stopped for a 10-minute break. Sunak says one of his general reflections on Covid is about data, and access to good data. Early on, good data was not available, he says. Keith shows Sunak another minute sent to Sunak implying Johnson kept changing his mind. In it an official refers to “a high risk that this [decision] unwinds\/is unpicked”. Sunak says he is not clear what this refers to, but he repeats the point he made earlier about it being reasonable for Johnson to mull over decisions. (See 11.33am.) Keith puts it to Sunak that the inquiry has heard evidence from some of Johnson’s closest advisers saying he kept changing his mind and that decision-making was chaotic. Were you aware that his closest advisers had seemingly unanimously taken the view that there was a lack of efficiency, that the administration was described privately as brutal and useless, or criminally incompetent or operationally chaotic? Was any of that known to you? Sunak replies: I don’t think any of those comments were shared with me at the time. He goes on: But he says there were intense debates about policy, as there should have been. He says: I don’t think that that is necessarily a bad thing. It’s right that there was a vigorous debate because these were incredibly consequential decisions for tens of millions of people in all in all spheres, whether it was health, whether it’s education, whether it was economic, whether it was social, whether it was a long-term impact. These these were incredibly big decisions, the likes of which no prime minister had taken in decades. So the fact that there was debate and that people were passionate about it, and they had different points of view, is, I think, unsurprising and good. Keith shows Sunak minutes of a bilateral meeting he held with Boris Johnson to discuss future measures. On the second page the official writing the minute for Sunak refers to the proposals and says: “Until announced you never know!” Keith puts it to Sunak that this is evidence that Johnson kept changing his mind. Sunak does not accept that. He says Johnson liked to test arguments for policies. As you review the evidence, the decision might change. “I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that,” he says. He suggests this is “entirely normal”. It shows Johnson was “engaging with the process and hearing from different people”. Q: So you reject the argument made in this article, that No 10 did not fully accept the need for a trade-off between different interests when deciding lockdown policy? Sunak says that debate did not happen. With the first lockdown, it did not happen “particularly extensively”, because everything happened quickly, driven by the public health advice. But later there was more discussion. Keith asks about this passage in the Spectator interview: A cost-benefit calculation – a basic requirement for pretty much every public health intervention – was never made. ‘I wasn’t allowed to talk about the trade-off,’ says Sunak. Ministers were briefed by No. 10 on how to handle questions about the side-effects of lockdown. ‘The script was not to ever acknowledge them. The script was: oh, there’s no trade-off, because doing this for our health is good for the economy.’ And he shows Sunak an extract from a Treasury document shown to senior ministers in April 2020 that expressly referred to a trade-off. Sunak says he is not sure that was a Treasury document. He says the author had worked for him, but went to work at a different department. He says, when he spoke about trade-offs in the interview, he was referring to the government’s communications strategy. He says the communications strategy was not necessarily wrong; there was a case for keeping it simple. But he says he was making the case for having a wider debate. Back at the Covid inquiry, Hugo Keith KC asks about a line in a Spectator interview with Rishi Sunak by Fraser Nelson in which Nelson said Sunak tried not to leave a paper trail of what he told Boris Johnson. Sunak says that was what Nelson said, not what he said himself. And he says that he did write to Johnson about Covid matters. Q: What should the inquiry make of the suggestion, that you seemed to back, that you had a form of communication with the PM that was not recorded. Sunak says it is not possible for all conversations between cabinet ministers to be recorded. Civil servants do not follow ministers through the division lobbies, when they might talk. And he says when he was in the garden at Downing Street having lunch with his family, and Johnson was there too, they might have spoken – but a civil servant would not have been there. He says what mattered was that decisions were recorded Turning back to Rwanda for a moment, Sam Coates from Sky News has more on what rightwingers are up to this morning. He has posted these on X. Emergency Rwanda legislation latest The Tory right is plotting its tactics. It remains unhappy with the bill and wants significant changes. But Some are now going to vote FOR second reading because they believe it gives them more leverage at committee stage. Play loyal for now, bide time, remain in spotlight So one calculation puts 20 abstentions on the right Then have the big fight in the new year. It is interesting that Cleverly and Pursglove did lots of calls yesterday and Pursglove implied he is open to looking at amendments, according to a source, which some see as a different message to No10 However others on the right fear that if you don’t show your strength - via abstentions - the moment the vote is done tomorrow No10 will say “we’ve won; no change necessary” So the right doesn’t get what it wants There will be a brief media statement outside Grimond Room around 12.45pm. In time for for 1pm news slot Q: Did you think cabinet was being sidelined, as some witnesses have said. Sunak says this is not his “strong recollection”. He says he was always able to give the PM advice. And he says the Covid-O and Covid-S system Boris Johnson set up – two cabinet committees, one dealing with operations, and another with strategy – made sense for Covid decision-making. He suggests the lack of a Covid taskforce at the start was a problem. But that was introduced. And he says this is a model that can be deployed again “off the shelf”. Q: And did you have a view as to how the Cabinet Office was performing was at the start? Sunak says those first few weeks were very difficult. He says people were doing the best they could. But, once the taskforce was in place, things worked better, he says. He says there are claims that decisions were not made in the right place. But his “strong recollection” is that they were. The Covid-O and Covid-S system worked well, he says. Keith shows Sunak pages from minutes of a meeting he held with Boris Johnson on 15 March 2020 – the day before the “stay at home” order was issued. Here is the first page Other pages covered the potential costs of interventions. Sunak says, as time went on, the quality of the analysis improved considerably. Q: When there was a key decision to be made, the Treasury kept making arguments to the PM until the last moment. Sunak says he is not sure that is fair. The PM set up a decision-making process that worked for him, he says. He says he does not feel he did not get the chance to make arguments to the PM. He says the PM saw him more than he saw his wife during this period, he says. Sunak says the PM had to balance competing interests during Covid. Only he could do that, because only he saw all the competing arguments made by different cabinet ministers. Q: Did you see it as your job to promote the Treasury’s concerns about the economy? Or did you take a view as to what the ultimate decision should be? Sunak says it is difficult to generalise. It depends what the meeting was considering. It would be “context-specific”, he says. But his primary responsibility was to feed in information about the economic advice. If the PM asked him for a general view, he would give it. Q: And was the PM the ultimate decision maker. A lot of your advice just went to him. Sunak says the PM was the ultimate decision maker. That is not particularly controversial, he says. Hugo Keith KC, lead counsel for the inquiry, is questioning Sunak. He starts by saying Sunak, in his witness statement, says he does not use text messages or WhatsApp messages much. Your phone, you said, doesn’t retain, and nor do you have access to, text messages at all relating to the period of the crisis. In addition, you said although on occasion you use WhatsApp to communicate around meetings and logistics and so on, you generally were only party to WhatsApp groups that were set up to deal with individual circumstances such as arrangements for calls, meetings and so on and so forth. You don’t now have access to any of the WhatsApps that you did send during the time of the crisis, do you? Sunak confirms that. He says: I’ve changed my phone multiple times over the past few years and, as that has happened, the messages have not come across. As you said, I’m not a prolific user of WhatsApp in the first instance – primarily communication with my private office and obviously anything that was of significance through those conversations or exchanges would have been recorded officially by my civil servants as one would expect. Rishi Sunak is giving evidence now. He starts by saing how sorry he is to all of who lost loves ones, and who suffered during the pandemic. UPDATE: Sunak said: I just wanted to start by saying how deeply sorry I am to all of those who lost loved ones, family members, through the pandemic, and also all those who suffered in various different ways throughout the pandemic and as a result of the actions that were taken. I’ve thought a lot about this over the past couple of years. It’s important that we learn the lessons so that we can be better prepared in the future. It’s in that spirit and with enormous respect for all of those who are affected that I’m here today. I look forward to giving evidence in the spirit of constructive candour to help the inquiry with its deliberations. Boris Johnson’s 200-page witness statement to the Covid inquiry was published at the end of last week, after he finished his oral evidence. This is what he said in it about Rishi Sunak’s “eat out to help out” scheme. Before the Eat Out to Help Out scheme was implemented in August 2020, I had discussions with Rishi about the idea. It was of course impossible to model the impact of the scheme but Rishi and I both thought that there was a sound policy rationale for introducing the scheme. In particular, we were acutely conscious that women had been disproportionately affected by the lockdown and were also disproportionately likely to work in the hospitality sector. We thought it was especially important to do what we could to help the sector – even something novel – and ultimately to safeguard the jobs of women and others in minority groups that had been badly affected by the pandemic. It seemed to me a good idea; it was properly discussed, including with Chris [Whitty] and Patrick [Vallance], and it was not until later that some people started saying, ‘eat out to help the virus’. Of course, we considered the implications for infections, but we thought that this could and would be mitigated by the social distancing requirements still in force and it was very important to balance that against damage to the economy. The scheme was decided on the basis of the balance of risk that we were willing to run during that period. The Covid inquiry has been getting a lot of criticism in the media in recent days, particularly from newspapers that have been critical of lockdown and supportive of Boris Johnson. Mostly the government has not commented on how the inquiry is proceeding. On Any Questions at the weekend Esther McVey, the rightwing Cabinet Office minister dubbed “minister for common sense” when she was appointed, did suggest that lockdown had been a mistake. She told the programme: I’ve been perturbed with the inquiry, that it seems one dimensional at the moment. However, it is an independent inquiry and it has got some time to run. I do hope it asks the questions about the damage of lockdown, about why was no modelling done, that instead of going into lockdown we could have given advice to the public and how they would have reacted. Actually most of us are have got, I’m going to use the word common sense, and we would have protected the vulnerable, we would have looked after our own, we would have taken care and advice. McVey also said that, as a backbencher, she has voted against lockdown. In his interviews this morning Grant Shapps, the defence secretary, defended Rishi Sunak’s record during Covid, claiming that as chancellor Sunak “saved the economy”. He told GB News: It’s so easy in hindsight to look at all these things with 20\/20 vision and say: ‘Ah, if only you had done X at Y moment in time’. The fact of the matter is Rishi Sunak, during Covid, saved millions of jobs in this country through the furlough programme and saved millions of businesses as well, with huge amounts of support – over £400bn. I think we should actually remember that he was the guy who saved the economy, an economy which – against all the expectations previously – has actually grown this year as a result of the decisions he made not to allow businesses and jobs to go. Nigel Farage was one of the few prominent rightwingers not being touted as a possible replacement for Rishi Sunak in the papers yesterday. But in their Mail on Sunday story, Glen Owen and Dan Hodges did quote one Tory suggesting he could be given a peerage and appointed home secretary. They said: One Tory MP said: ‘When Farage comes back he’s going to be all over the airwaves, and he’s going to have us in his sights.’ Another said: ‘Reform are going to kill us, so we have to buy Farage off. The plan is we get him into the Lords, give him some brief like we did with Cameron – maybe even home secretary – then go to the country with the dream team. Among the Tories were touted as possible Sunak replacements were: Boris Johnson: In its story, the Mail on Sunday said: The Mail on Sunday has spoken to multiple Conservative MPs who believe that bringing back the former premier is the only way to save the party from an election wipe-out … One red qall MP told the MoS: ‘I came out early to say [Johnson] had to go. But I think we have to think outside the box now. Whatever you feel about him, one thing no one can question is his effectiveness as a campaigner. And we need that now, we’re staring at obliteration. Kemi Badenoch: The Sunday Times said the business and trade secretary is working on a leadership bid. In their story Tim Shipman and Harry Yorke said: Cabinet colleagues accuse Kemi Badenoch, the trade secretary, of calling another minister to say: “The ship is heading for the rocks. What are we going to do about the captain?” One cabinet minister entertaining thoughts of a leadership run said: “Kemi’s people are already offering jobs. I know that because one of my people was approached.” A source close to Badenoch told the paper this was untrue. Dame Priti Patel: The Mail on Sunday floated the idea that the former home secretary could installed as a caretaker prime minister while Johnson arranged to return to the Commons. Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg: The former Evening Standard editor Emily Sheffield posted this on X. Sir Simon Clarke: This is what Alex Wickham and Kitty Donaldson said about the former levelling up secretary in their Bloomberg long read. Some Tory lawmakers are plotting to oust him. Allies of his predecessor Liz Truss have held talks with colleagues about writing letters of no confidence in Sunak, and some want Simon Clarke, a rightwing backbencher, to challenge him, people familiar with those conversations said. Truss’s spokesman said she’s not plotting, while Clarke told Bloomberg he wants the government to succeed. There are several other figures in the party also whose leadership ambitions are well known, such as Suella Braverman, the former home secretary. UPDATE: The Times today has another addition to this list. David Cameron: In his story Matt Dathan says: Another ally of Johnson said the party’s fortunes were so dire that the former prime minister would struggle to win: “Even if he managed to secure a seat, what by-election can you imagine us winning,” the MP said. They said it would be easier to install Lord Cameron of Chipping Norton, the foreign secretary, as he has a winning record and is already in the House of Lords. Constitutionally the King could accept Cameron as prime minister so long as he agreed to stand for a Commons seat at an imminent general election. Ever since he gave up leadership of the Brexit party, and let Richard Tice lead it under its new name, Reform UK, Nigel Farage has liked nothing more than teasing the media with hints about a possible comeback. He was at it again this morning, in an interview with ITV’s Good Morning Britain after finishing third in I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! Farage was asked if he wanted to rejoin the Conservative party, which he used to belong to until he left to help set up Ukip in the 1990s. He replied: I am looking at a Conservative government that is in total shambles, facing tomorrow effectively a confidence vote on an issue that affects every single living human being in our country, namely immigration on a level that never happened even during Tony Blair’s days. Rishi [Sunak] is a lame duck walking. The Conservative party are headed for total defeat. As to whether I have a future in politics, I have no idea at this moment in time. But what I would say is never say never. And our country needs, actually, people at the top with some firm guidance as to where we’re going in the future. At the moment we are rudderless and I don’t see a Labour party with strength to get us out of this mess. Good morning. Rishi Sunak is in “facing his worst week as prime minister” territory. All prime ministers have weeks that are described by the media as their most difficult yet, and this does not necessarily mean all his lost. Tony Blair was regularly having “worst weeks yet” throughout his entire 10-year premiership. But Sunak really is in a dire state. He is facing near-certain electoral defeat at some point in the next 13 months and now, for the first time since he became leader, there is real speculation about some sort of leadership challenge. In what will be seen by many non-Tories as a sign that the party is flirting with insanity, there has even been talk of a Boris Johnson comeback. Sunak faces two particular challenges today. First, he is spending most of the day at the Covid inquiry, where he is likely to face questions about his lockdown-sceptical stance as chancellor that led him to be nicknamed “Dr Death” by Prof Dame Angela McLean, who is now the government’s chief scientific adviser (presumably that did not come up at her interview). Sunak will also be asked about his “eat out to help out” scheme. Tom Ambrose has a preview here. But, more importantly, two groups of Conservative MPs will meet to decide their stance on the new Rwanda deportation bill that is getting its second reading in the Commons. This is the issue that is creating a division in the party deep enough to pose an existential threat to Sunak’s premiership. It seems likely the bill will pass tomorrow, but only because Tory MPs will put off the key fight until report stage after Christmas, when rightwingers will try to amend it in one direction, centrists will try yanking it in the opposite direction, and at that point there might be no bill left the party can unite around. Even if the bill survives the Commons, it is bound to face challenge in the House of Lords. But perhaps the biggest danger of all for Sunak is that the bill does become law – only for it to fail to totally to “stop the boats” because of ongoing legal challenges (which is what his critics are saying is bound to happen). Rowena Mason has the latest on this here. Grant Shapps, the defence secretary, was doing a media round this morning. He defended the bill, claiming that it would stop 99.5% of appeals against deportation. He told Times Radio: I think my simple message is this plan is working, let’s unite behind it and get this further legislation through. This legislation, by the way, based on Home Office calculations means that of the cases which currently allow people to appeal, that only about one out of 200 cases ultimately would be able to get through that appeal. So this is a very significant, even dramatic move, designed to make the Rwanda route work. Shapps was referring to Home Office modelling leaked to the Times. In his story Matt Dathan says: The Home Office believes 99.5% of individual legal challenges submitted by migrants will fail to block their deportation to Rwanda under Rishi Sunak’s emergency law, leaked documents reveal. Modelling prepared by officials to assess the risk of individual legal challenges scuppering Rishi Sunak’s emergency Rwanda bill predicts nine in ten of all claims would be rejected with no right of appeal within ten days of their arrival in the UK … The department believes that of the 10% that are granted a hearing, 90% will be struck out at the second stage of the legal process. Only half of the remaining cases that are allowed to progress to an upper tribunal appeal would succeed and lead to the migrant remaining in the UK, according to the Home Office modelling. It means that if 1,000 migrants were to lodge individual legal challenges against their removal, 900 would be rejected at the first stage and only five migrants would ultimately succeed in blocking their deportation. Here is the agenda for the day. 10.30am: Rishi Sunak starts giving evidence to the Covid inquiry. He is due to give evidence all day. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. Noon: Sir Bill Cash briefs members of the European Research Group and other rightwing Conservative groups in parliament on the findings of the ERG’s legal “star chamber” on the viability of the Rwanda bill. 1.30pm: Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, holds talks with the main parties in Northern Ireland on efforts to resume power sharing at Stormont. 3pm: Sir Matthew Rycroft, permanent secretary at the Home Office, gives evidence to the Commons public accounts committee about the Rwanda deportation policy. 6pm: The Conservative One Nation Caucus meets to consider its stance on the Rwanda bill.

       "     'bodyText': 'Conservative MPs are split in their views on the government’s safety of Rwanda bill, which is aimed at overcoming the legal issues that have delayed the deportation plans. Pressure is being brought to bear on Rishi Sunak by moderate MPs, coalescing under the banner of the One Nation caucus, while rightwingers associated with a number of groups known as the “five families” have already received advice from a group of lawyers to the effect that the bill does not go far enough to ensure that the Rwanda deportation plan is not be frustrated by court challenges. To avoid defeat in Tuesday’s parliamentary vote, Sunak will need to keep the rebellion below 56 abstentions or 29 votes against. The five families Believed to be a reference to the five families who are alleged to control the mafia in the US, these MPs come from among the members of the European Research Group (ERG), the Northern Research Group (NRG), the New Conservatives, the Common Sense Group and the Conservative Growth Group. The groups, who favour a hard line on immigration but have expressed differing shades of scepticism about the bill, met at Westminster on Monday. A “star chamber” of lawyers convened by the ERG has already told them that the bill does not go far enough to deliver the policy as intended. The findings, by the veteran backbencher Sir Bill Cash and four others, said that “significant amendments” would be needed to stop the removal of people to Rwanda being frustrated through legal challenges. While the bill seeks to allow parliament to deem Rwanda a “safe” country and block courts from considering claims that it will not act in accordance with international obligations, some on the right believe more radical measures are needed, such as moves to set aside international law. The severity of the star chamber’s criticism took some by surprise and clashed with the government’s own legal advice, which was published on Monday. Rightwing MPs are urging the government to make concessions, although there is varying degrees of opposition among their ranks. In a statement on Monday night, the New Conservative caucus said that the bill needed “major surgery or replacement”. Briefing of Tory MPs was under way by government whips on Monday, who were expected to argue that key elements of the star chamber’s advice was simply wrong. Sunak will also seek to win over a group of influential rightwingers over a breakfast at Downing Street on Tuesday morning. The most likely scenario is that rightwingers support the bill at its second reading, with a view to seeking to amend it at a later date, abstain or vote the legislation down. One Nation caucus Conservative MPs from the largest single group in the parliamentary party – counting more than 100 members, almost a third of the total – have the numbers to bring down the bill. But as a wing, they have a vested interest in keeping Sunak in power, as the failure of the bill would imperil his position and open the door for a challenge from the right. Nevertheless, many are concerned that the bill sets aside some of the UK’s obligations in international law and have been taking legal advice from the former solicitor general Lord Garnier, who has told the BBC that the legislation is “political nonsense and legal nonsense”. Matt Warman, a former minister who is a leading member in the caucus, wrote on the Conservative Home website on Monday that many of its members worried that declaring Rwanda a safe country in law was a push too far. But he expressed caution about whether now was the time for the parliamentary party to “push the prime minister off a tightrope”. This week’s vote was not procedurally the moment where amendments would be laid, he added, but it was where all sides had a chance to set out their stalls and for the government to provide vital reassurances. Any big group of MPs was likely to hold a range of views, and the next steps “shouldn’t be to push for a further compromise that might break a delicate balance”. On Monday evening, after a meeting in Westminster, the group announced that it will vote for the legislation.'},\n",

       "     'bodyText': 'Nigel Farage has suggested he could return to politics following his appearance on I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here!, but dismissed the idea he could rejoin the Conservative party under Rishi Sunak. The former Ukip leader finished third in the reality television programme over the weekend after being locked in a box of snakes for his final challenge. Farage’s spell on the ITV show has led some Conservatives to speculate he could return to British politics as a Tory politician, having left the party in 1992 over the signing of the Maastricht treaty. Reports this weekend suggested some Tory MPs wanted Boris Johnson to return as party leader before the election on a double ticket with Farage as a way to reverse the party’s poll deficit. Farage told ITV’s Good Morning Britain on Monday he would consider doing so, saying: “Never say never. I can’t predict right now what will happen.” But he dismissed the idea he could return to the Conservatives under Sunak’s leadership. “I am looking at a Conservative government that is in total shambles, facing tomorrow effectively a confidence vote on an issue that affects every single living human being in our country, namely immigration on a level that never happened even during Tony Blair’s days. “Rishi is a lame duck walking and the Conservative party are headed for total defeat,” he said. His comments will keep hopes alive for those on the right of the Tory party that they could fashion some kind of deal with Farage’s Reform UK party, which is now polling at about 9%. Senior Conservatives have toyed with the idea of enticing Farage back to the party since the Brexit vote. In recent months his reputation on the Tory benches has been enhanced as the party’s poll rating has slumped. Sunak appeared to open the door to a return for the Reform UK founder during the Tory party conference this year when he told GB News: “The Tory party is a broad church. I welcome lots of people who want to subscribe to our ideals, to our values.” The idea of a joint Johnson-Farage leadership bid would be very difficult to engineer given neither has a seat in the House of Commons. It would either require a Conservative MP to resign their seat within months to allow Johnson to return or for an ally to act as prime minister until the election, when he may be able to come back to the Commons. Farage’s allies say he is unlikely to seek a seat as an MP at the next election, having failed on several occasions in the past. One told the Guardian this weekend: “I think the chances of him standing for election is pretty much nil. Apart from anything else, when he was standing for Ukip back in the day it ended up with him being locked up in South Thanet [where Farage stood] whereas this time he can roam around the country.” Farage said on Monday he would not make any immediate decision. “Somehow to think that we’re going to walk out of a jungle after 23 nights and announce a relaunch in British politics, frankly, is for the birds,” he told GB News.'},\n",

       "     'bodyText': 'Rishi Sunak is facing the biggest week of his premiership, with his authority in the hands of two warring Tory tribes vying to set out their battle lines on his flagship Rwanda bill. The prime minister is beset by rebellion on the right and left of the party, with up to 100 MPs on each side due to meet on Monday afternoon to debate how to vote on the legislation. To avoid defeat at Tuesday’s parliamentary vote, Sunak will need to keep the rebellion below 56 abstentions or 28 votes against. The prime minister’s allies have spent the weekend pleading with key groups on the left and right of the party, hoping to stave off a rebellion that could sink a bill he claims will stop most court challenges to deporting migrants to east Africa. David Cameron, the foreign secretary, has been among those spending the past few days trying urgently to persuade Tory MPs to back the plan at the second reading. In a hint Sunak could be open to further compromise, a government source said: “We are talking to colleagues, but we are confident this bill is extremely robust and makes the routes for any individual challenge vanishing small. This is the strongest possible piece of legislation to get Rwanda operational.” Monday’s drama will unfold as Sunak faces a gruelling day giving evidence to the Covid inquiry on issues such as the controversial “eat out to help out” scheme which has been blamed for spreading the virus in 2020. While Sunak speaks, up to 100 backbench MPs on the right of the party are expected to gather from noon to discuss the Rwanda bill. Robert Jenrick, a former close ally who resigned as immigration minister on Wednesday, is among those who say they cannot support the legislation in its current form. “I won’t be supporting this bill, but I do think we can fix this, and that’s what I want to do now,” he told the BBC on Sunday. “I care about this policy because I care about border security and I’m determined that we can persuade the government and colleagues in parliament that there is a better way.” A number of MPs from overlapping groups on the Tory right, are expected to join Jenrick in abstaining or even voting against the legislation at second reading – saying that they will only be able to support it with changes to harden it. They will meet in parliament’s Thatcher Room to hear from the veteran Tory Eurosceptic MP Sir Bill Cash’s “star chamber” of lawyers, who will warn the bill does not go far enough to set aside human rights law in order to deport migrants to Rwanda. There was, however, evidence that some MPs were open to making the legislation work, with the New Conservative leaders Danny Kruger and Miriam Cates suggesting this was their approach over the weekend. Later, the One Nation group of Conservative of MPs, which also has about 100 members, will meet at 6pm and release its verdict an hour later. Tory sources said its “centre of gravity” was moving towards backing the bill at second reading, but that they would not be able to stomach changes demanded by the right of the party that involved circumventing international human rights law. A handful of MPs on this side may vote against or abstain. They are expected to say the bill comes very close to what they can accept. One member suggested that leading cabinet members such as Alex Chalk, the justice secretary, and Victoria Prentis, the attorney general, could find it difficult to accept a hardening of the bill. A leading One Nation MP said: “Success looks like the ‘left’ of the party saying ‘this is as far as we can reasonably go’, and there’s quite a lot of us, and the right of the party saying ‘how about this’ – and hopefully coming up with something with that doesn’t trash all of international law. Then maybe we would be fine. “But the difficulty is no one thinks this legislation is perfect. There will be people on my side who say it disapplies bits of the HRA [Human Rights Act] and I’m not going to vote for it. My gut, which sounds like wishful thinking, is that we will find a way through it … But the thing that blows it all up is Jenrick and Suella [Braverman] saying it won’t work. The thing we all care about is finding a way that it can work.” With his flagship legislation in trouble and little sign of the polls narrowing, there is growing talk of ousting the prime minister before the election by plotters within his own party. Some backbenchers are keen to reinstall either Boris Johnson or an ally of Liz Truss. Johnson is no longer in parliament but some MPs think he could return in a byelection if Sunak were removed, with others pushing for him to team up with the Reform politician and former Ukip leader Nigel Farage. The Mail on Sunday reported that his critics within the Tories were planning “an Advent calendar of shit” to destabilise his leadership in the run-up to Christmas. But many Conservative MPs on the left of the party are anxious about the idea of a plot against Sunak before going to the polls, as getting rid of him would bring in a third unelected prime minister since the last election. Damian Green, the leader of the One Nation group of MPs and a former deputy prime minister, said those wanting to remove Sunak were “mad or malicious, or both”. Sunak’s position was defended on Sunday by Michael Gove, the communities secretary, who insisted top lawyers had said the government’s new legislation aimed at sending asylum seekers to Rwanda was “sound”. Speaking to Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips on Sky News, Gove suggested his party had had a “relative success” already in responding to irregular migration, which reached a record high this summer. “It’s pretty tough, actually, if you look at what we’re saying,” he said. “Of course we will look at what any colleague and, indeed, any eminent lawyer says, but whether it’s Jonathan Sumption or David Wolfson, they are pretty clear, this law is sound.” He also insisted the government was “not contemplating” holding a general election if the legislation were voted down.'},\n",

       "     'bodyText': 'It was about 5pm on Wednesday, as rumours began to spread like wildfire around the palace of Westminster about a big ministerial resignation, that Tory MPs found themselves asking an all too familiar question. Was authority draining away from their leader and prime minister? Suella Braverman, recently dismissed from the cabinet by Rishi Sunak for serial disloyalty, had just delivered a stinging personal statement to the House of Commons, surrounded by a few supporters on the party’s right wing, including Liz Truss. The group had nodded enthusiastically as the ousted home secretary said that Sunak’s latest plan for sending asylum seekers to Rwanda – to be unveiled a few hours later – must override human rights laws in order to work, and warned that if it did not, the Tories faced electoral “oblivion”. Braverman’s words were strong, but they were not the hottest topic of discussion in many quiet corners of the Commons. The word was getting round that Braverman’s speech would be followed within an hour or so by another bombshell departure from the Home Office, with the resignation of the immigration minister, and friend of Sunak, Robert Jenrick. Close to the Commons chamber, a former minister on the left of the party, when asked what he thought of the goings on, paused and said merely “there are no words [to describe my feelings]” before snorting and spinning off down the corridor. Nearby, a pair of ex-ministers on the opposite wing of the party – no supporters of Sunak – could be heard talking about Jenrick and what it all might mean for the PM. “Interesting times,” was the assessment of one, who then walked away, grinning. It was an afternoon and evening of unrelenting Westminster drama that could match many from the latter days of Boris Johnson or Liz Truss. At 6.30pm, Braverman’s replacement as home secretary, James Cleverly, had been at the dispatch box announcing the new emergency immigration bill on the Rwanda plan – now Sunak’s signature policy – as Labour MPs tried to shout him down with derisive taunts and cries of “Where’s Jenrick? Where is he?”. Where, indeed, was the man supposed to be fronting the entire bill on which Sunak appeared to be staking his reputation? Wednesday was supposed to have been the day that Johnson provided the media with its top political story from morning until night, with his appearance before Heather Hallett’s Covid inquiry. He duly did, until early evening. But after that, Sunak’s travails became the far bigger news, as yet another Tory prime minister seemed to be on the slide. At a meeting of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers that evening, supporters of Sunak were pleased he had turned up and come out swinging. “He was animated,” said one veteran. “He was blunt with the party. I thought, this guy wants to win. He wants to win this argument. It was like: ‘You’re either coming with me or you’re heading to opposition.’ He didn’t say it, but the impression was strongly left that some of our colleagues did want to be in opposition. Robert [Jenrick] may have given up, but I and others haven’t.” That early show of mettle, however, was almost immediately punctured by confirmation of Jenrick’s decision to quit. The news set minds racing faster, and planted new doubts about the man at the top and the breadth of his support. “It is very bad for Rishi. Jenrick and him were close,” said another former minister. “When you lose your friends, you have to worry. He has problems now if this spreads.” The next morning, Sunak held a rather tetchy mid-morning press conference defending the new bill and describing it as “the toughest immigration law ever”, while listing what he saw as his many other achievements in just over a year as prime minister. It was a show of bravado, but to some on his side it was all rather grating and ill-judged, not to say desperate. One former cabinet minister said: “In performance terms, Rishi being butch doesn’t work – for contingent reasons, like the fact that he is short and has a light voice. That is not his fault. But what is his fault is not to realise that his brand, Rishi at his best, is Rishi saying ‘I know more about this than you do, I am cleverer than you, I have read every word about this, I am now going to explain calmly to you why I am right and you are wrong,’ rather than this ‘come and have a go, mate!’ approach.” If the style was not working for many, the plan for the legislation to speed through parliament was also coming unstuck, as the whips picked up signs of widespread Tory disgruntlement. In his press conference, Sunak had said the bill to get flights off to Rwanda with asylum seekers on board would be pushed through “faster than ever before”. In fact, so great was concern about the prospect of mass rebellion that within a few hours business managers had shoved back the timetable so that only the second reading of the bill would happen before Christmas, and not the inevitably more problematic stages where amendments would be tabled. Labour also noted the delay could have big implications for the general election, which Sunak has hinted he wants to fight on immigration issues. The shadow leader of the house, Lucy Powell, said: “He [Sunak] has now pushed the bill back, moving difficult votes at committee stage into the new year, not before Christmas. That now leaves the prospect of all stages of the bill happening in time for a May election in serious doubt.” Others said royal assent in time for a May poll was virtually impossible, given the inevitability of hold-ups in the Lords. It is now more than two months since Sunak tried to reset his premiership by announcing U-turns on the green agenda, and by abandoning the northern section of the HS2 rail line. More recently, he has focused on immigration and the Rwanda plan, hoping to create a key dividing line with Labour. But politically, there is little sign that any of it is working for him. In fact, the indicators point the other way. Ominously for the prime minister, the latest immigration bill has brought various Tory factions on the right of the party together in a common cause. The European Research Group (ERG) – so critical during Brexit – along with the so-called New Conservatives and the old-right Common Sense Group, are now all worried, as Braverman had warned, that the new plans do not go far enough to allow international law to be bypassed, to ensure that Rwanda flights can actually take off. Some Tory MPs have found themselves at ERG meetings for the first time since the Brexit battle, to register their concerns. “I hadn’t been for years,” said one senior figure. “This is a bit like Brexit in the sense that it will have the effect of drawing the whole of the right together. It is the uniting of the right.” These three pressure groups alone, MPs said, could count 100 MPs among their collective memberships, indicating the size of the problem facing Sunak. Many of them are already describing votes on the bill – the first of which will happen on Tuesday – as key tests for Sunak’s authority, which could possibly determine his longevity as prime minister. “There is a definitive test of its effectiveness, and that is: will the planes fly?” said one former minister. “In six months’ time, if we find that the bill is law but it hasn’t worked, then that’s going to be catastrophic for Rishi. So they had better make it work. The stakes couldn’t be higher.” On the left of the party there is deep unhappiness too. The One Nation group, comprising more than 100 MPs on the centre and centre-left, is also worried about the bill. Writing online for the Observer, its leader, Damian Green, says his group too will make a judgment on how to approach the legislation at a meeting early this week. Their discomfort about anything that appears to disrespect international law is clear. The latest crisis in the Tory party is inevitably raising increasing questions about the strategy, judgment, and leadership coming from No 10. Many Tories are simply puzzled as to why the prime minister has decided to stake so much on a fight about immigration and ignored other, better subjects on which they believe he could cause real problems for Labour. “The next election isn’t going to be settled on immigration, and we’re slightly making problems for ourselves by having such a focus on it,” said one baffled former cabinet minister. “If you can flip things to more of an economic argument, that’s where the public are most concerned. That’s where Sunak is strongest, too.” As it is, the government now faces a protracted parliamentary battle on an issue that, initially at least, has served more to expose divisions within his own party, and sow internal doubts about his leadership, than cause trouble for Labour. While it is premature to talk of a leadership crisis or challenge to Sunak, some senior figures seem uncertain. Asked how he thought votes on the bill would go and if the PM could be in trouble, former party leader Iain Duncan Smith did not deny the potential for a crisis was there. “It is an important decision,” he said. “Everyone is keeping their counsel.” Another senior figure on the right said the “most likely” outcome would be that the bill would be given its second reading this week with only a few Tories abstaining or voting against, and then rewritten with amendments at later stages. Should it ever make it out of the Commons, there is the grim prospect of the Lords, where peers will feel it is their right to challenge a measure, on constitutional and legal grounds, that was not in the last Conservative manifesto. Tory peers have already raised concerns. And yet, just as the prime minister and his whips need to be wargaming the party’s factional responses to a bill on which Sunak’s own credibility may rest, the PM’s precious hours will be taken up this weekend going over his testimony to the Covid inquiry, before which he will appear on Monday. The hearing is yet more evidence of Sunak’s inability to escape his own party’s recent past. The inquiry has apparently been circulating in its bundle of evidence an interview conducted by Sunak during the Tory leadership contest in the summer of 2022, which he lost to Liz Truss. In the interview, with the Spectator magazine, Sunak suggested that scientists had too much power and that key discussions about the trade-offs arising from lockdowns were not discussed. “This is the problem,” he said at the time. “If you empower all these independent people, you’re screwed.” Then there are the troubling notes of Sunak’s comments made by Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser at the time of the pandemic. In a diary extract from 13 May 2021, Vallance noted a meeting at which Sunak “suddenly pipes up on incentives already in place. Argues that we should let this rip a bit.” Vallance also claimed in his diary that Sunak was pushing “very hard for a faster opening up and fuller opening up, getting rid of all restrictions”. More pressing than anything, however, is the “eat out to help out” scheme, which went ahead without the knowledge of key advisers. Boris Johnson has claimed that chief medical officer Chris Whitty called the scheme “eat out to help the virus”. Some who lost loved ones in the pandemic squarely blame the scheme. After a day of torment at the inquiry, Sunak’s parliamentary battle will begin in earnest on Tuesday. Ultimately, some figures who have sat in the Commons since the Brexit vote are getting a horribly strong sense of deja vu. Sunak finds himself leading a party irreconcilably divided and in no mood to find common ground, just months away from an election. “What he ended up doing was trying to weld the positions of two sets of people together as best as you can,” said a former minister. “But the difficulty is, those two positions aren’t actually compatible. “Usually, you have an element of ‘self-whipping’ that kicks in around this time, where people start to show an element of resolve and sense. That doesn’t seem to be evident.”'},\n",

       "     'bodyText': '‘If you don’t fix immigration, immigration will fix you.” This was new foreign secretary David Cameron’s stern warning to US senators, but it could equally have been addressed to parliamentary colleagues back home. Last week saw the latest in a series of immigration reform packages, yet nearly a year on from Rishi Sunak’s pledge to “stop the boats” his government seems no closer to a fix which satisfies his party or its supporters. There are two problems with the policies announced last week: those which work won’t address concerns, while those which address concerns won’t work. The first big package of reforms focused on the rules governing visas, with the goal of bringing net migration numbers down from record highs. While last week’s restrictions may well reduce inflows, they principally target groups – students and skilled workers – who enjoy broad public support. And even if numbers do fall, the impact won’t be visible in migration statistics until after the election. The second announcement was the latest chapter in the long campaign to get asylum seekers on to planes to Rwanda. Even if the government eventually succeeds in getting these planes in the air, the scheme is doomed by its flawed premise. The “Rwanda scheme” is meant to deter migrants crossing the Channel on small boats – a source of real public concern. But migrants willing to risk their lives making this crossing will not be put off by a minuscule risk of being sent on to Rwanda. This policy will not “stop the boats” and voters know it. Polls show that while many favour the Rwanda scheme in theory, most think it is a waste of money which is unlikely to work. The broader electoral landscape has also changed dramatically since then-prime minister Cameron struggled with immigration a decade ago. The public is now far more positive about immigration and its effects. Voters now favour maintaining or increasing migration into every profession asked about except banking, while support for migration to fill vacancies in the NHS and social care is overwhelming. A large part of this change is structural – the demographic groups most favourable to migration, such as graduates and ethnic minorities, are growing, while the social conservatives most opposed to it are in decline. The Conservatives’ anti-migration campaigns have electoral goals: winning back swing voters from Labour and seeing off a challenge from Reform UK on the right flank. Neither looks easy to achieve. Swing voters do not prioritise immigration and no longer trust the Conservatives on the issue. The hardline approach does not work as an electoral dividing line, as when invited to compare the two parties’ proposals, voters heavily prefer the Labour offer. Conservative focus on the issue also risks backfiring by reinforcing swing voters’ impressions of the Tories as divided, extreme and out of touch with their concerns. Nor do the current proposals look promising as a means to see off a challenge on the right. Attacks from rightwing backbenchers have already undermined the credibility of Sunak’s new policies with hardline voters, and even if implemented rapidly they will not deliver the swingeing cuts such voters want in time for an election. The endlessly repeated and never-delivered promise to “stop the boats” has thus provided Reform UK with the perfect stick to beat the government in the coming campaign. The government’s effort to see off Nigel Farage may have set the perfect stage for his return. The government’s mess over immigration brings both risk and opportunity for Labour. An incoming Labour government will face the same deep challenges and the same sceptical electorate – the voters who have lost faith in the government have little confidence in the opposition either. Rebuilding public trust on immigration will be hard, particularly as the emotive flashpoint of “small boats” migration will probably continue. And if Labour stumbles, the Conservatives will be eager to pounce. Anti-migration campaigns will be easier to run in opposition, liberated from the pesky constraints and compromises of governing. Yet the electoral coalition Labour has now assembled is, for the first time ever, strongly pro-migration. The voters who will back Labour next year already agree that open migration policies, properly managed, can be a vital ingredient in rebuilding public services and delivering economic growth. The Conservatives’ haphazard campaign of random restrictions and performative cruelty looks set to fail. Labour need to show voters a better approach is possible.

       "     'bodyText': '“Rishi is heading for Theresa territory,” says one Conservative backbencher, after a week in which Sunak appeared to lose control of his party. A managerial prime minister squeezed by warring Tory factions, mired in a parliamentary battle and haunted by the missteps of their predecessor: Sunak will be wary of how May was ousted after struggling to get her flagship policy through the House of Commons. The prime minister has had one of the worst weeks of his premiership after losing Robert Jenrick, his immigration minister, who told him his Rwanda plan was not strong enough to work. He is due to give evidence to the Covid inquiry on Monday, and will face challenging questions about the wisdom of his “eat out to help out” scheme, which is blamed for helping to spread the virus in summer 2020. His government has also been hit by a return of headlines about Partygate as Boris Johnson gave evidence defending No 10’s actions during the pandemic. And yet Sunak will face an even greater challenge on Tuesday as he attempts to get his emergency legislation aimed at overcoming legal hurdles to the Rwanda plan through the House of Commons. Tory MPs think it is now likely that the legislation will pass, but the two factions of the party are planning to lay opposing amendments in support of their positions in the coming weeks or after Christmas. The hard right of the party wants more concrete opt-outs from human rights law, and the centrist wing worries that Sunak’s emergency legislation already goes too far in undermining human rights. “I don’t think the showdown will be on Tuesday,” said one Conservative former minister on the more centrist wing of the party. “If it hadn’t already been invented, we wouldn’t invent the Rwanda scheme but we are where we are. But the real issue is simply going to be how do you get to a point that both wings of the party are happy. “That is hard to envisage that. But we got through Brexit, so maybe we will get through this.” Conservative MPs have said the One Nation group is broadly more on board with the position than the right wing, although there will be some who cannot support the legislation as it stands. On the right, there are more who are hardline and refusing to support the bill without further amendments down the line. There is also growing disquiet among Tories about the rising cost of the scheme, opening up territory for Labour to attack the party on the grounds of competence and bad economic management. “It’s too expensive and not going to be value for money quite obviously,” one MP said. “But politically, it’s now impossible to junk this.” Tory MPs have described the atmosphere towards Sunak as frustrated and support for him as “wobbly”, with many regarding his decision to bet his premiership on stopping small boats as being unwise. However, only one Conservative MP, Andrea Jenkyn, has gone public with her no-confidence letter despite reports of more than a dozen having gone in to the 1922 Committee of backbenchers. The clear difference with May’s premiership is that Sunak and his Tory colleagues are staring down the barrel of an election within the next 12 months, despite trailing hugely in the polls. Conservative MPs know they ought to be presenting a united front, and the idea of a swapping to a third unelected prime minister in as many years would probably be too much for the electorate to stomach. One former cabinet minister said that while they did not necessarily expect an imminent leadership challenge, reaching the necessary threshold of 53 letters of no confidence from Conservative MPs could not be ruled out. “There are more than 50 colleagues who know they will lose their seats, so they essentially have nothing to risk,” they said. “There are another 150 who think they might lose their seats. We could very easily get to a point where 50-plus letters go in and we stumble into a leadership election. “I don’t think there’s any appetite for it now, but that is contingent on things not getting any worse. If we get into spring and the polls are deteriorating, it could change very suddenly. Watch this space.” One longer-term reason for Sunak’s unpopularity was the perception he had shifted the government to the centre with the appointment of David Cameron as foreign secretary and James Cleverly to the Home Office, they added. “It looks like he has chosen Winchester over Workington,” the MP said. “The problem is that Winchester has already probably chosen the Lib Dems. Workington is still to play for.” The big battle over the immigration legislation is also crucial for the timing of an election. If it looks like it will pass, Sunak will want as much time as possible to try to get a flight to Rwanda off the ground before going to the polls. If it is blocked, it is possible he could call an early contest fought on the grounds of trying to get a parliament that will pass the law and possibly a hardline manifesto promise to leave the European convention on human rights. However, one Conservative minister dismissed the idea of an early poll, saying they would be very surprised if Downing Street opted for a spring election. “As the polls stand, we would lose badly. I can’t think of a prime minister who went for an election before they had to, knowing that they would lose. There is always the hope that something will come up. And if not, you get more time being prime minister.”'},\n",

       "     'bodyText': 'Robert Jenrick has accused the prime minister of failing to keep his word “to do whatever it takes” to “stop the boats”. The former immigration minister quit his role on Wednesday just hours after Rishi Sunak tabled a bill to save his Rwanda deportation policy. Jenrick stood down after it was revealed that the legislation did not allow the government to override the international laws that have stopped it sending asylum seekers to central Africa. Rwanda had said it would pull out of the deal if the UK ignored international law and up to 10 ministers had indicated they could resign if the bill did so. In an article for the Daily Telegraph, the MP for Newark in Nottinghamshire claimed that when he was appointed in October 2022, the Home Office was “beleaguered”, with the UK “beyond breaking point” due to the number of crossings of small boats in the Channel. He said that was compounded by the “indefensible” and “farcical” situation of hotels accommodating asylum seekers. Jenrick wrote: “The prime minister was right, therefore, to promise to do whatever it takes to end this farce. And, until Wednesday, he had kept his word.” He added that Sunak was right to argue the new Rwanda bill went further than the previous legislation, however he said that if passed it would still fail to end the “merry-go-round of legal challenges that prevent small boat arrivals being swiftly removed in sufficient numbers to create a meaningful deterrent”. Section four of the bill allows people to lodge challenges against their individual deportation to Rwanda. Jenrick wrote: “Backlogs will likely build, and cases that would at best take months to resolve will be stayed considerably longer. Injunctions will likely follow. “And we will begin losing bail claims, forcing us to release people from detention. People will of course abscond and disappear into communities. “The idea, therefore, that this bill will guarantee all those arriving are detained and swiftly removed is for the birds. “The only bill capable of delivering that is a bill that guarantees removal within days, not months, of arrival by blocking off individual challenges that would otherwise prevent that.” Jenrick wrote that he also believes that integrating people from different countries into British society is “impossible” at the current levels of immigration. “GP services and hospitals do not grow on trees,” he wrote. “Integration is impossible if you let in over 1.2 million new people as we have done over the last two years.” The Rwanda (asylum and immigration) bill stopped short of leaving the European convention on human rights and does not include the “notwithstanding clauses” that would allow ministers to circumvent the ECHR and other international treaties. The legislation, which must be voted on by parliament, gives ministers the powers to disregard sections of the Human Rights Act. The prime minister told an emergency Downing Street press conference on Thursday that he would “finish the job” of getting his controversial deportation plan off the ground despite criticism from the Tory right and anxiety among centrist MPs.'},\n",

       "     'bodyText': 'The Home Office has been ordered to give parliament the “full and frank” costings of the scheme to deport migrants to Rwanda, after admitting projected initial spending had doubled to almost £300m. Matthew Rycroft, the permanent secretary of the Home Office, has been asked to attend the public accounts committee on Monday to explain the situation, after the initial costs of the scheme rose from £140m to £290m. The committee issued its summons to Rycroft after No 10 stressed that it was Suella Braverman, who was sacked as home secretary last month, who signed off an extra £100m payment to Rwanda earlier this year, not Rishi Sunak. (See 12.08pm.) Humza Yousaf, Scotland’s first minister, has said a court ruling saying the UK government was entitled to veto the Scottish parliament’s gender recognition (reform) bill shows devolution is “fundamentally flawed”. (See 2.49pm.) No individuals will receive a penalty from the Metropolitan police regarding a gathering in parliament in December 2020, the force has said. Senior Downing Street officials have flown to Delhi to kickstart talks over a multibillion-pound free trade agreement, with the government of Narendra Modi having indicated it is keen to finalise a deal in the next three months. In the House of Lords earlier two Labour peers, Lady Taylor of Bolton and Lord Kennedy of Southwark, asked the Home Office minister Lord Sharpe if the new payments to Rwanda revealed last night were being made under letters of direction – the process whereby senior civil servants can register that they are not sure a particular policy is value for money, and ministers have to say in writing it must happen anyway. Sharpe said he did not know the answer, but would reply in writing. In fact, the Home Office revealed the answer last night. In his letter Sir Matthew Rycroft, the permanent secretary, said all payments to Rwanda, including the £100m one this year and the £50m one scheduled for next year, “are covered by the ministerial direction of 16th April 2022”. Rycroft was referring to the ministerial direction originally issued to enable the scheme to go ahead in the first place. Priti Patel, the then home secretary, had to issue one after Rycroft said he was not convinced the policy was cost effective. In his letter at the time Rycroft said: I recognise that, despite the high cost of this policy, there are potentially significant savings to be realised from deterring people entering the UK illegally. Value for money of the policy is dependent on it being effective as a deterrent. Evidence of a deterrent effect is highly uncertain and cannot be quantified with sufficient certainty to provide me with the necessary level of assurance over value for money. I do not believe sufficient evidence can be obtained to demonstrate that the policy will have a deterrent effect significant enough to make the policy value for money. This does not mean that the MEDP [migration and economic development partnership] cannot have the appropriate deterrent effect; just that there is not sufficient evidence for me to conclude that it will. Humza Yousaf, Scotland’s first minister, has said today’s court judgment saying the UK government was entitled to veto Scotland’s gender recognition (reform) bill shows the devolution settlement is “fundamentally flawed”. He gave his reaction in two posts on X. Today’s judgment confirms beyond doubt that devolution is fundamentally flawed. The Court has confirmed that legislation passed by a majority in Holyrood can be struck down by Westminster. The only way to guarantee we get true self-government is through independence. This is a dark day for devolution. Sovereignty should lie with the people of Scotland, not a Westminster Government we didn’t vote for with the ability to overrule our laws. We, of course, respect the Court’s judgment and will take time to consider its findings. The full 65-page judgment is here. Lord Davies (Lab) suggests the government does not want the asylum claim backlog cleared quickly – because so many would be approved. Sharpe says that is an interesting theory – but the government is clearing the backlog, he says. Hilary Armstrong (Lab) says that, although Sharpe is saying the deterrent effect of the Rwanda policy is already working, because small boat crossings are down by a third, the PM has said that is due to the deal with Albania. Sharpe says the Albania deal is part of government policy on this. Sharpe says none of the money provided to Rwanda so far has come from the aid budget. Sharpe says payments made to Rwanda so far represent about 30 days of the amount being spent putting up asylum seekers in hotels in the UK. He says if the plan succeeds, as he thinks it will, it will be good value for the taxpayers. UPDATE: Sharpe said: The simple fact of the matter is the daily cost of hotels for migrants is now £8 million. The cost of the UK’s asylum system has roughly doubled in the last year and it now stands at nearly £4bn. So the payments made so far to Rwanda represent about 30 days of hotel costs. Criminal smuggling gangs are continuing to turn a profit using small boats. We have to bring an end to this and when this plan succeeds, as I think it will, I think British taxpayers will acknowledge it actually represents good value for money. Lady Hayter (Lab) asks if the deal allows for money to be clawed back. Sharpe says he does not know. Lord Collins, the shadow deputy leader of the Lords, says the new Rwanda treaty has changed the nature of the scheme. He says ministers should disclose costs. Sharpe says the permanent secretary at the Home Office has disclosed extra payments in his letter to the two select committee chairs. The total spend so far is £240m, he says. In the House of Lords Lord Sharpe, a Home Office minister, is answering a private notice question (the Lords equivalent of an urgent question) on payments to Rwanda. He says no extra money was provided to Rwanda to go with the new treaty. And he says the precise costs for the deportation scheme will depend on how many people go to Rwanda. He says sums payments under the economic partnership will be disclosed in the Home Office’s annual accounts. Oliver Dowden, the deputy prime minister, has said the government is “four-square” behind Israel in its efforts to remove the threat of Hamas. Speaking alongside the chief rabbi, Ephraim Mervis, at a vigil in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, Dowden said: I stand before you, not just as the deputy prime minister, nor as the member for Hertsmere, but also as a proud friend of Israel and a supporter of our Jewish community. I want to say to you that the government stands four-square behind the central missions of Israel, of the Israel Defense Forces, of the Israeli government, namely, number one, to secure the release of every one of these hostages, and we will stand four-square until that is delivered. But not only that, we must ensure that this cannot happen again, and that means, however difficult it is, we have to remove the threat of Hamas to stop it being able to do this to Israel again, and we stand four-square behind Israel in that mission as well. In the House of Lords this morning peers have been debating Love Matters, a report on families and households by a commission set up by the archbishops of Canterbury and York. Opening the debate, Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, warned that the new family visa rules announced this week would have a “negative impact” on married and family relationships. He said: The government is rightly concerned with bringing down the legal migration figures and I’m not, you’ll be relieved to know, going into the politics of that. But there is a cost to be paid in terms of the negative impact this will have on married and family relationships for those who live and work and contribute to our life together, particularly in social care … The state is useful to the family, the family is indispensable to the state. A lack of strong families undermines our whole society. Government needs families to work. They must not set a series of hurdles for them to jump over. He also called for the removal of the two-child cap on benefit payments. He said: The End Child Poverty campaign estimates removing the two-child limit will lift a quarter of a million children out of poverty. The moral case is beyond any question, yet the unfair penalty applied to additional children affects their educational outcomes, mental and physical health, their likelihood to require public support from public services later on. It is not a good policy. Will the government and the opposition, should they become the government at some point, consider removing the two-child limit and addressing other systems and policy choices which keep family in poverty? In normal circumstances it would not be surprising to hear a Conservative MP expressing support for the party leader, but with backbenchers muttering about a leadership challenge, Rishi Sunak will be glad of all the support he can get and so the Jonathan Gullis interview on Sky News a few minutes ago will probably go down well. Gullis is one of the rightwingers pushing most strongly for a tougher Rwanda deportation policy. But, when asked if he would continue to support Sunak, he replied: The prime minister will retain my confidence and I believe he should lead us into the next general election and that is unequivocal. He also declined an invitation to criticise the extra £100m given to Rwanda, saying that he was not aware of the details of the negotiation with Rwanda and that he thought the deportation scheme would eventually prove value for money. Here is Libby Brooks’ story about the court of sessions judgment saying the UK government’s veto of Scotland’s gender recognition reform bill was lawful. No 10 has restated Rishi Sunak’s claim that his new Rwanda bill will only allow a very small number of people to challenge deportation orders – despite a report claiming lawyers have warned ministers that that is not the case. (See 10.33am.) Asked about the Times story, and echoing the line used by the legal migration minister Tom Pursglove this morning, a No 10 spokesperson said: We expect that [the number of those] able to provide compelling evidence about specific individual risks will be vanishingly narrow and that’s why we believe that this is the best approach to get flights swiftly off the ground. The spokesperson also refused to say whether Pursglove’s comments about amendments to the bill this morning (see 10.03am) meant the government was willing to accept changes to its approach. Asked if ministers would compromise on the legislation, the spokesperson said: There will be the usual processes and debate next week. I wouldn’t pre-empt that process. But we’ll be setting out why we believe our approach is the best and swiftest way to get flights off the ground. Ministers will publish a “pack of evidence” about conditions in Rwanda on Tuesday to support its case that it is a safe country for asylum seekers, Downing Street said this morning. At the lobby briefing, a No 10 spokesperson said there would be evidence that “underpins and explains the work that we’ve been doing with Rwanda” published to coincide with the second reading of the safety of Rwanda (asylum and immigration) bill. The main provision of the bill says that ministers, immigration officials and courts “must conclusively treat the Republic of Rwanda as a safe country”. Last night, during a press conference in Washington, David Cameron, the foreign secretary, said he had seen the evidence and found it persuasive. He said: A bill has been published and will be introduced to the House of Commons and a pack of evidence about the true nature of what happens in Rwanda is being put together. I’ve seen that myself and I think it’s very convincing and will overcome the arguments put in the supreme court. The Scottish government has lost its legal challenge at the court of session in Edinburgh against the UK government’s decision to use the Scotland Act to block the Scottish parliament’s gender recognition (reform) bill. This is from the BBC’s James Cook. Downing Street has signalled that Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, was responsible for the decision to approve an extra £100m payment to Rwanda this year. At the lobby briefing this morning, asked who “signed off” the money, a No 10 spokesperson told journalists: The home secretary. It is an operational decision to release funding under the MoU [memorandum of understanding]. And asked if the payment was “signed off” by Rishi Sunak, the spokesperson replied: No. It’s part of the existing MoU [memorandum of understanding]. So it’s an operation decision for the home secretary to sign off. That’s the usual process. The MoU with Rwanda was agreed in April 2022, when Priti Patel was the home secretary and the Rwanda partnership was first announced. No 10 said today that the original MoU made it clear that payments would go to Rwanda in addition to the original £140m. Last night, in his letter to two select committee chairs, Sir Matthew Rycroft, the permanent secretary at the Home Office, said a further payment of £100m was made to Rwanda under the deal in April. As the BBC’s Chris Mason revealed this morning, No 10 and the Suella Braverman camp have been engaged in a briefing war, in effect blaming each other for the payment. (See 9.21am.) The No 10 spokesperson did not criticise Braverman over the payment, or even mention her by name. But Downing Street does not always answer government process questions with such clarity. Sunak sacked Braverman last month, and since then she has launched a series of bitter attacks on his record over immigration. It is widely assumed she wants to replace him as party leader. The government currently has a working majority of 56 and as yet no Conservative MPs are publicly saying they intend to vote against the Rwanda bill on Tuesday next week, and so at the moment the risk of government defeat seems extremely small. But Tory MPs on both wings of the party – the rightwingers who want the government to ignore the European convention on human rights on migration policy, and “moderates” who fear the government has already gone too far – have concerns about it, and some of them may be more inclined to abstain than to vote against. Stephen Hammond, a member of the “moderate” One Nation Caucus, told Times Radio that he would not decide whether or not to support the bill until Monday. He said: I’m encouraged by some of my friends’ legal advice, which is that by leaving in section four of the Human Rights Act, that does overturn some of the more worrying aspects. But I think what I want to do, and what a lot of my friends want to do, is have the chance to look at it really carefully over the weekend and then make a decision on Monday. The Commons is not sitting today, but the Lords is, and Labour has been granted a private notice question (the Lords equivalent of a Commons urgent question) on the costs of the Rwanda deportation policy. It has been tabled by Lord Collins of Highbury, the shadow deputy leader of the Lords, and it will be taken at about 12.30pm. A minister will respond. As Kiran Stacey and Pippa Crerar report, some Conservative MPs have criticised the party’s HQ for running a social media advert showing a picture of a BBC presenter making a rude gesture. In his Today programme interview this morning, Tom Pursglove, the legal migration minister, defended the post. Asked about the controversy, he told the programme: I’ve not spent an awful amount of time on Twitter in the last 24 hours as you’ll imagine, having just been appointed yesterday and trying to immerse myself in all of the detail. But the bottom line is it does highlight the fact that the Labour party doesn’t have a credible alternative? The DUP has played down suggestions that it is close to an agreement that would see it lift its boycott of power sharing at Stormont. The Northern Ireland assembly has not been sitting, and there has been no power-sharing executive, as a result of the boycott, which started in 2022. The DUP is protesting against the post-Brexit trading rules set out in the Northern Ireland protocol, and amended by the Windsor framework. As PA Media reports, speculation has been growing in recent weeks that the DUP could be closing in on an agreement with the UK government that could restore the assembly at Stormont. The Northern Ireland secretary, Chris Heaton-Harris, said negotiations were in their “final, final phase”. But Gavin Robinson, the DUP’s deputy leader, told the BBC’s Good Morning Ulster programme this morning: Jeffrey Donaldson [the DUP leader] said a number of weeks ago that we will not be calendar-led. The issues that we are raising with the government have been long in fruition. It is a matter for the government whether they are prepared to recognise the harm that they caused to Northern Ireland, recognise that the Windsor framework was significant progress in that endeavour, but there is still more work to be done. At his press conference yesterday Rishi Sunak said that under the new Rwanda bill successful legal challenges against deportation will be “vanishingly rare” because the bill is so tightly drafted. This morning the Times has splashed on a story saying some lawyers have told the government that that is not true. In their story Matt Dathan and Steven Swinford report: The Times has been told that Downing Street was warned by two senior lawyers that the scheme risked failure because it would continue to allow migrants to lodge challenges against their individual removal to Rwanda. Legal advice from a senior government lawyer said “the scheme would be seriously impeded” if the bill did not include a so-called “ouster clause” that barred individual legal challenges. Separate external legal counsel that was sought by the government warned that the failure to bar individual challenges “is inconsistent with the intellectual underpinning of the bill and also would provide an easy way for many applicants to avoid the effects of the bill”. Asked about this story, Tom Pursglove, the new legal migration minister, played down suggestions it contains a signficant loophole, saying the law was “robust”. He said: The legislation closes off so many of the grounds that people have come forward with in raising claims about being sent to Rwanda previously. We believe that this is robust … I believe that this will do the job. The prime minister has said that we will do whatever is necessary in order to make this work. This is an important step in doing that. When Rishi Sunak said that the government would respond to the supreme court judgment on Rwanda with a bill saying the country was safe, he described it as emergency legislation. But that is a term normally applied when the government passes a bill within days. It has taken the Home Office almost a month to produce a bill and the government has not even committed to trying to get it through the Commons before Christmas. Yesterday Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, told MPs the second reading would take place on Tuesday. But she did not say when the remaining stages of the bill would be debated, and she did not mention them when she listed what MPs would be doing on the days leading up to the start of the Christmas recess. In interviews this morning, Tom Pursglove, the legal migration minister, was unable to say when the bill would clear parliament. Asked about this, he told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: You’ve got to have consideration in both houses of parliament and that does take some time. The whips and the leader of the house will come forward in terms of setting out a timetable by which we will seek to do this. I want to see this legislation delivered as quickly as possible. The Times is reporting this morning that Sunak has decided to delay the key votes on the bill in the Commons (the report stage votes on amendments) until the new year “to give him more time to win support for his legislation”. Tom Pursglove, the new minister for legal migration, was trying to play down suggestions that the Conservative party is tearing itself apart over the Rwanda policy in his interviews this morning. He told the Today programme that there was “a unity of purpose on the Conservative benches in parliament” over the need to address the issue. But he did suggest that the government might accept amendments to the safety of Rwanda (immigration and asylum) bill, which is getting its second reading on Tuesday. Yesterday Rishi Sunak suggested that if he were to move “an inch” in the direction of making it tougher, Rwanda would withdraw support for the policy. But when Pursglove was asked on Sky News if the government would accept amendments to the bill, he did not say no. He replied: There will be parliamentary debates, there will be opportunities for people to bring amendments, the house will consider them in the normal way and as ministers we will engage constructively with parliamentarians around any concerns that they have, and handle that in the way that we would any other piece of legislation. The Liberal Democrats have described the Rwanda deportation policy as an “unforgivable waste of public money” in the light of the new revelations about how much it is costing. This is from Alistair Carmichael, the party’s home affairs spokesperson. The fact that this government is content to squander millions on this totally unworkable white elephant of a policy tells you everything you need to know about their priorities. Three home secretaries and millions of taxpayers’ pounds later, the Conservatives have nothing to show for their failing Rwanda policy. It’s an unforgivable waste of taxpayers’ money – and to think this could have paid for more than 5m GP appointments just puts salt in the wound. It’s time for the Conservatives to accept reality and abandon this impractical, inhumane and extortionately expensive policy. The Home Office only disclosed the full costs of the Rwanda deal in response to pressure from Commons committees. Last week Sir Matthew Rycroft, the permanent secretary, told the home affairs committee that the figures would not be published until next year. This morning Meg Hillier, the chair of the public accounts committee, accused the government of “cloak and dagger” tactics. She told the Today programme: We’re very concerned that at each step of the way, as a change is proposed [to the Rwanda policy], we have no detailed information about what’s happening … It’s unconscionable that MPs would be expected to vote on this without understanding fully what the costs are so far, what they are expected to deliver and what the costs are going forward. Emily Dugan has more on what Hillier said here. Good morning. Rishi Sunak is still struggling to persuade his party to back his new Rwanda deportation bill, and at his press conference yesterday he was trying to focus attention instead on Labour, criticising it for not backing legislation he claimed was in line with “the values of the British people”. When the policy was first announced last year, Labour did not immediately commit to scrapping the policy. But it did, over time, harden its opposition to the policy. It has said it will vote against the new bill on Tuesday, and last night the Home Office made an announcement that must strengthen Labour’s case considerably. Until yesterday the price tag for the Rwanda policy was £140m – £120m of which was going on the economic development part of the Rwanda deal, and £20m to fund setting up the facilities that would allow the country to house asylum seekers from the UK. But last night, in a letter to the chairs of the home affairs committee and the public accounts committee, which have been asking for information about the full costs, Sir Matthew Rycroft, the permanent secretary at the Home Office, revealed that another £100m has been paid this year, and £50m more is due to be handed over next year. That will take the total cost of the scheme to £290m by 2025 – even though not a single asylum seeker has been flown to the country, and there is still considerable doubt as to whether any will. Commenting on the revelation last night, Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said: This is just incredible. The Tories have wasted an astronomical £290m of taxpayers’ money on a failing scheme which hasn’t sent a single asylum seeker to Rwanda. How many more blank cheques will Rishi Sunak write before the Tories come clean about this scheme being a total farce? Britain simply can’t afford more of this costly chaos from the Conservatives. Tom Pursglove, the new minister for legal migration at the Home Office, has been doing an interview round this morning and he defended the payments. He told Times Radio: We’ve always been clear that this is an economic and migration partnership. We want to support economic development in Rwanda. And of course, there are quite understandably obligations on us to work with Rwanda to make sure that all of the right infrastructure to support the partnership is in place. But a more telling indication of how this is seen in government came from the BBC’s Chris Mason revealing on the Today programme this morning that Rishi Sunak and Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, seem to be blaming each other for the payments. He said that No 10 sources are saying Braverman signed off on the payments, although Sunak knew about them, and that sources close to Braverman are saying it was the PM who approved the payments. In reality, they were both responsible. The Home Office paid the money, with No 10 approval. If they are trying to pretend otherwise, MPs won’t find that convincing. I will post more from the Pursglove interviews, and more on the Rwanda crisis, shortly. Otherwise, it may be a quiet day. There is a No 10 lobby briefing at 11.30am, and we are due to get the judgment from the court of session in Edinburgh on whether it was lawful for the UK government to use the Scotland Act to block the Scottish parliament’s gender recognition (reform) bill.

       "     'bodyText': 'Larry Elliott makes two main arguments in his article (I’ve got news for those who say Brexit is a disaster: it isn’t. That’s why rejoining is just a pipe dream, 5 December). He’s wrong on both. His first point is that the EU is faltering and the UK is recovering more quickly from global headwinds. However, he is using the wrong comparison. We should not compare the UK with the EU, but with what the UK would have been like without Brexit. The opportunity cost, not the relative comparison, is the relevant factor. And on this correct measure, Brexit is deeply damaging to the UK economy. The Office for Budget Responsibility is crystal clear on this point – it expects long-run productivity to reduce by 4%, and imports and exports by 15%; and new trade deals will not have a material impact. Worse, the damage will accrue for many years to come – not just in sales lost and companies that have already folded, but in businesses that will never be set up and developments that will never take place. The second point Elliott makes is that the UK has avoided the rise of far-right parties such as the Alternative for Germany party or the Freedom party in the Netherlands. On this point, I can only imagine that he is being wilfully blind. The Tories are the functional substitute for the European far-right parties. They have dealt with the rise of the far right by adopting its language, policies, presentation and contempt for norms and governance. It is disturbing that Elliott ignores this in favour of spurious pro-Brexit arguments. Oscar Franklin Chatham, Kent • Larry Elliott’s excellent article highlighted real challenges to those of us who persist in campaigning to overturn Brexit. But he did not mention the educational and wider political identity that being part of the EU confers. I have just returned from a conference in Italy to discuss progress towards a pan-European graduate-tracking study that will monitor graduate careers and migration among member states and beyond. We used to be able to compare similar UK employment statistics with those of other European countries as part of the EU-funded Eurostat, but the UK is not included any more. And that’s only one area of social science research. Think about all the scientific, political, humanities and arts research, and opportunities for knowledge exchange that have been affected by Brexit, not to mention the wider cultural restrictions in the performance arts. Academics cannot so easily work with their European colleagues and we have seen a significant exit of European scholars from British universities. Our children can’t participate in the Erasmus undergraduate exchanges either. Hopefully some of these disadvantages can be ameliorated after a change of government, but in the short term, they have been costly. The UK is a group of small islands just off the coast of Europe and our long-term interests surely lie in Europe. We should be in there, in support of other Europeans who are fighting the rise of the far right. Kate Purcell Coventry • I agree with Larry Elliott. Playing political hokey cokey around membership of the EU will be a disaster. The problem with making Brexit a success is that the political, economic and business establishments don’t accept his analysis of the underlying weaknesses of the UK economy, particularly the punishing impact of a combination of economic inequality, stagnated growth and a chronic inability to invest in the future by the state and the market. We need an alternative to the neoliberal economics that has led the country to absorb such absurdities as water firms dumping raw sewage into our rivers, for which no one can be held to account. On the flip side, if you advocate for models of public ownership for our utilities, which are the norm in the six founding EU nations, you are painted as a dangerous radical. Labour’s position seems to be that bringing us back to a state of pre-Brexit orthodoxy will sort out the economy. I think Elliott would agree that that is flawed. We need an alternative. It’s not coming from the main two-party system. Brexit was led by the extreme right and was an anti-immigration vote. But for Brexit to work, we need something way more progressive than Keir Starmer’s Labour, and that is unlikely to emerge from our two-party system, which is tied at the hip to the dogma of neoliberal economics. Cllr Mark Blake Independent Socialists, Haringey council, London • Larry Elliott writes that Brexit “isn’t a disaster” for the economy. He’s right, but perhaps not in the way that he thinks. Mainstream economics would not characterise Brexit as disastrous for growth. Rather, Brexit is an inversion of Dave Brailsford’s maxim of “marginal gains” – the wildly successful sporting philosophy that saw British champions triumph at the Tour de France. If the UK economy were a cyclist competing in the Tour d’Europe, she wouldn’t be totally unfit – but she would be subject to a series of “marginal losses”, struggling at the back of the peloton, envious of her less-afflicted competitors. Eventually, she’d probably fire her manager, and strive to undo the marginal losses that impair competitiveness. Sam Langfield Principal economist, European Central Bank, and former economist, Bank of England • I had the most overwhelming feeling of sadness on reading Larry Elliott’s article. As the child of a displaced person who couldn’t get back to her own country after the second world war, but was welcomed in the UK even though she was German, I felt totally rejected by the country of my birth. My mum came here without a word of English and only the clothes she stood up in. She was given a job in a cotton mill and eventually taught herself enough English to be able to train as a nurse. She embraced life here. She came not even knowing if she would ever see her family again. My heart bursts with pride at her bravery and determination. Now, thanks to Brexit, I feel people like her would be vilified and despised. Like millions of others fleeing conflict and persecution, all Mum wanted was a home and a life – and the UK gave her that. Mr Elliott doesn’t look at the bigger picture. Ingrid Marsh Newton Abbot, Devon • One glaring omission from Larry Elliott’s article is the ways in which Brexit has made things better. Privacy? Human rights? Trade? Water quality? Roaming charges? Staff shortages? Food prices? Trust in politics? A policy that has made almost everything worse and made nothing better can’t be anything other than a disaster. Jon Page Camberley, Surrey • So Brexit is only a partial disaster. That’s all right then. David Walters Cardiff • Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

       "     'bodyText': 'Rishi Sunak was forced into a desperate defence of his new Rwanda asylum law as he battled to hold together the fractured Conservative party amid speculation that he could face a challenge to his position. The prime minister told an emergency Downing Street press conference that he would “finish the job” of getting his controversial deportation plan off the ground despite criticism from the Tory right and anxiety among centrist MPs. The Conservative party chair, Richard Holden, warned MPs that it would be “insanity” to try to oust Sunak over the issue after the resignation of Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, and denials from Suella Braverman that she was spreading poison in a bid to get rid of him. Yet Sunak faces a rebellion on both flanks of his party as MPs consider whether to vote against the legislation when it comes to the Commons next week, or whether to try to amend it. Sunak said the vote would not be a “confidence matter”, giving Tory MPs who vote against it some leeway and meaning he will not be obliged by convention to stand down or call an election if he loses. Since Labour has stated that it will oppose the bill, it would take just 29 Tory MPs to vote it down. His tetchy appearance in front of reporters followed a chaotic 24 hours during which Jenrick quit, arguing that the proposed law did not go far enough and was a “triumph of hope over experience”. As Sunak has staked his government’s reputation on coming up with a plan to “stop the boats”, Jenrick’s departure was a serious blow to his authority. There has been speculation that at least a dozen Tory MPs are considering submitting letters to trigger a confidence vote. The Tory MP Rachel Maclean, one of several deputy chairs of the party, told GB News that the Rwanda vote would, in fact, be a confidence issue. “Of course it’s about confidence in the government and what it delivers,” she said on Thursday evening. It has emerged that the cost of the scheme had more than doubled to £290m. The Home Office admitted that, on top of the initial £140m payment, it had handed over a further £100m, and extra £50m is to follow. Responding to the news, Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said: “This is just incredible. The Tories have wasted an astronomical £290m of taxpayers’ money on a failing scheme which hasn’t sent a single asylum seeker to Rwanda. “Britain simply can’t afford more of this costly chaos from the Conservatives.” The emergency bill will give ministers the power to ignore some judgments from the European court relating to asylum, while stopping short of leaving or “disapplying” the European convention on human rights (ECHR) in its entirety. Defending his plans, Sunak claimed his rightwing critics were wrong to say that the bill would not work. He insisted there was only an “inch” between what they were demanding and what the Rwandan government would accept without the scheme “collapsing” entirely. But his critics have argued that the legislation raises the possibility that the Rwanda plan would still be open to individual legal challenges under domestic law. A group of Tory rightwingers are taking legal advice on the bill through the so-called star chamber court process used to assess Theresa May and Boris Johnson’s Brexit plans, before deciding whether to back it or move against it next week. One insider said concerns were focused on clause 4 of the bill, which permits challenges in the domestic courts. They told the Guardian that they planned to back the bill at its second reading on Tuesday, then try to have it amended it at a later stage. However, one MP indicated that they were willing to vote against the bill if it did not incorporate any of the amendments they put forward. “I can’t see how we would support a bill that doesn’t achieve its purpose,” they said. Supporters of the prime minister are furious at the Tory right’s response. One MP described their colleagues as “batshit crazy” and added: “Not a single one of them is a true Conservative.” Sunak also faces a challenge from the centrist One Nation group of MPs, who number over 100, and who sources said were “very nervous” about the draft legislation. It is likely that the legislation will run into trouble in the House of Lords. Edward Garnier, who is advising the centrist One Nation group on the bill, said on Thursday he would vote against the bill. The legislation is “nonsense”, Lord Garnier said, adding that passing a bill to declare Rwanda is a safe country was like passing one saying “all dogs are cats”. However, the attorney general, Victoria Prentis, and the justice secretary, Alex Chalk, who were previously said to have reservations about a hardline approach to the Rwanda plan, are both understood to be “comfortable” with the bill. Allies of the pair said they were reassured that it would not lead to the UK withdrawing from the ECHR. Neither is believed to be considering their position. Richard Holden warned colleagues against jostling for position amid tensions over the Rwanda plan. Echoing the prime minister’s calls for unity, he suggested it was the “biggest challenge” his party was facing ahead of the next election. Asked if he could rule out another leadership contest before the next election, he said: “I think it would be insanity to do that.” The party needed to be “fighting the opposition rather than ourselves”, he said. “We all know that divided parties don’t win elections.” Suella Braverman, who was sacked by Sunak as home secretary, was forced to deny “spreading poison” within the party on Thursday. In a combative interview, she told the BBC she was a “plain speaker” and was not trying to remove the prime minister. However, she refused to back the deportation plan, insisting that “the reality and sorry truth is, it just won’t work”, again warning Sunak of the “perilous” situation the Tories found themselves in given his pledge to stop the boats at the start of the year. “The facts don’t lie, and we need to deliver on a key promise. That’s how we will win the next general election,” she said. “The time for talk, the time for slogans and promises is over. We need to show delivery, and that’s what this debate right now is all about.” Sunak told reporters the bill fundamentally addressed concerns raised by the supreme court over the deportation policy and would guarantee that Rwanda was “unequivocally” safe for asylum seekers. In an attempt to curtail the growing rebellion on the right, he said the legislation would be an “effective deterrent” to people coming to the UK illegally and would restore public trust in the system. The law would end “the merry-go-round of legal challenges” that had blocked the Rwanda plan so far, he said. “We have blocked every single reason that has ever been used to prevent flights to Rwanda from taking off.” He admitted that legal challenges could still be brought against removals, but insisted that the new law left only an “extremely narrow exception” that would require individuals to provide “credible and compelling evidence” that they faced risk of serious harm. The Kigali government has stressed the need for the new UK legislation to be compatible with international law. Sunak said: “If we go any further, the entire scheme will collapse, and there is no point having a bill with nowhere to send people to.” He has appointed two ministers to cover the brief. Michael Tomlinson becomes the minister for illegal migration – attending cabinet – while Tom Pursglove becomes the minister for legal migration and delivery.'},\n",

       "     'bodyText': 'Conservative internal turmoil after the publication of Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda plans and Robert Jenrick’s resignation has cast a spotlight on the patchwork of different factions that make up the parliamentary party. While the prime minister insists the Tories remain a “broad church”, he faces particular pressure from a range of Conservatives on the right wing of the party who coalesce around several groups labelled “the five families”. The groups, whose membership sometimes overlap, consist of the New Conservatives, the European Research Group, the Common Sense Group, No Turning Back and the Northern Research Group. They are largely holding fire until a “star chamber” of experts has pronounced on the proposed legislation. But there is also pressure from those sometimes referred to as moderates in the One Nation Conservatives, who remain a sizeable force. The New Conservatives The newest and one of the most vocal groupings, it was created in May and includes the party’s deputy chair Lee Anderson, as well as Tories gaining more prominence such as Miriam Cates, although many are in marginal “red wall” seats. Its MPs, who are thought to number about 25 and are predominantly from the party’s 2019 intake, have been tightlipped on Sunak’s latest proposals but the group’s co-chair Danny Kruger has pressed the PM to deliver the Rwanda deportation plan by “unpicking” Britain from a range of international obligations. European Research Group (ERG) A group that perhaps had its moment in the sun during the civil war that engulfed the party under Theresa May, it has become active once again in terms of putting pressure on Sunak to take a hardline approach on Rwanda. In an echo of the days when May was on the receiving end of similar moves to hold her feet to the fire, it was the ERG chair, Mark Francois, who announced details this week of the star chamber chaired by the veteran Eurosceptic MP Sir Bill Cash, which will scrutinise Sunak’s Rwanda bill. Northern Research Group (NRG) Less clearly ideological in some ways than the other groups, the NRG has prioritised investment in the north. The group was founded by Tory MPs elected in red wall constituencies of England as well as Wales and Scotland in 2019. But as the NRG chair, John Stevenson, said, it also sees immigration as a significant issue for many of the voters who elected the party. He believed Sunak’s proposed legislation would be “overwhelmingly” supported by northern MPs. “Some may have wanted it to be more robust but I think that most will support it and I would be surprised if anybody went against it,” he said. Common Sense Group The group was launched with relatively little fanfare in the summer of 2020 with about 40 members, who have been at the forefront of leveraging “culture war” issues, including criticising the National Trust leadership. Led by Sir John Hayes, the veteran Conservative backbencher and former Home Office minister who is close to Suella Braverman, it has been pushing alongside the New Conservatives for tougher action on both legal and illegal immigration. No Turning Back With a lower profile than the other rightwing groups, No Turning Back traces its lineage back to the the 1980s when it emerged as an ultra-Thatcherite force within the party and has since included MPs who were cheerleaders for the ill-fated Liz Truss administration. John Redwood, who was one of Thatcher’s ministers, is the group’s chair and has been consistently pushing a UK withdrawal from the European convention on human rights (ECHR) as a means of ensuring that the Rwanda deportation plan can be realised. One Nation Conservatives The single biggest grouping within the party, it claims to have a membership of 106 MPs and is regarded as the umbrella for moderate Tories. Some of its members had previously described overriding the ECHR as a “red line” and, as the bill has implications for Britain’s commitments under the convention, its MPs remain nervous about it. They are yet to make a final decision before next week’s vote on the second stage.'},\n",

       "     'bodyText': 'It was a three-pipe problem. Rishi Sunak sank back into a creaky armchair and waited for the morphine to take hold. He picked up a violin and began a painful threnody. Over on the other side of the room, Dr Dowden kept his peace. Downstairs, Mrs Hudson prepared breakfast. Eventually Sunak broke his silence. He spoke with a dull rasp. “You know, Olive,” he said. “This is the most difficult case of my entire career. Of far more consequence even than that fiend Moriarty. No less than the future of the entire Conservative party is at stake.” The Curious Affair of Robert Jenrick. How could it ever have come to this? How could the most vacuous, most empty-headed MP of his generation – the one who throughout his time in parliament had said or done anything to further his career – have turned out to have a principle after all? The whole purpose of Honest Bob was to believe in nothing except himself. Now it turned out that his immigration minister – make that former immigration minister – did have a line in the sand. And that was because he could not support the government’s batshit crazy (TM James Cleverly) Rwanda policy. Not because it was batshit crazy. But because it wasn’t batshit crazy enough. It didn’t completely degrade Britain’s legal standing in the world. So now he and Suella were the darlings of the Tory right. Waiting to pick up the pieces when he lost the next election. “There’s only one thing for it,” said Sunakered Holmes. “We must hold a press conference. That should show the country I know what I’m doing.” “Good plan,” replied Olive. “Nothing shouts strong and stable government like a last-minute, panicky presser. Though maybe now is not the time to go on about integrity, professionalism and accountability. There again, you haven’t mentioned them for a while anyway.” So at 11am Rish! marched purposefully into the Downing Street media centre. Maybe it was just the morphine comedown, or maybe he was just tired. Either way he came across as tetchy and entitled from the start. By the end he was having a full-blown toddler temper tantrum. A complete meltdown. Unable to accept any reality but his own. Railing against a cruel and unfair world that has treated him so badly. No one has suffered more than Sunak. Down to his last £700m. At the very least, the country could show some gratitude for all that he had done. Rish! began with a short statement. He was proud to be the child of immigrants. But you know what? Sometimes you can have too many of them. And that time had long since come. God knows, it had reached the point where he even hated himself. So enough was enough. The country deserved better than this after 13 years of a Tory government. His ability to shape-shift into an alternate reality is breathtaking. Almost as though his Conservative party is a totally different party from the one that has been running the country for well over a decade. That the Sunak who was Boris Johnson’s chancellor is not the same Sunak who is now prime minister. Then to the details of the new Rwanda legislation. “I respect the supreme court’s decision,” he said. A barefaced lie. Of course he doesn’t. Otherwise he wouldn’t be scrabbling around trying to undermine it. Think about it. A Tory prime minister at the heart of the establishment doing away with the rule of law. This is the kind of thing we expect from petrostate dictators. Rwanda would now be declared a safe country. To say otherwise would be a crime punishable by death. We knew this because the law said so. So if Rwanda did accidentally shoot a few refugees then at least they could die knowing they had been shot safely. All legal protocols had been observed. He would also disapply all international laws. It would be like the Covid rules in No 10: optional. British law would become global law. Apart from Rwanda law. The Rwandans had insisted that a few legal caveats be inserted into the bill – these were the bits to which Honest Bob and Suella objected – to make them compliant with Rwandan law. Imagine. It’s now a matter of pride to Sunakered that Britain has lower legal standards than Rwanda. The stuff that dreams are made of. That was that. We could do what we liked with refugees. Deport them, kill them. Whatever. It was their lookout for daring to come here. Of course individuals could appeal against their deportation\/execution. But let them try. Cue another backlog of cases in the courts and no flights to Rwanda. The whole thing was just smoke and mirrors. A depraved exercise in performative vindictiveness. Rish! only dared take questions from the main broadcasters and three tame media sources. But even they had turned on him. This wasn’t about a viable bill to stop illegal immigration. It was about civil war within the Tory party. His government was falling apart, decaying in front of our eyes. Sunak just got even more ratty. The contempt not just for the reporters but for the entire country on show. How dare anyone suggest this was about party management? There was no chaos in the Tory party. The existential crisis was Labour’s. He was the stabiliser. The lone rational voice in Westminster. No, the vote wouldn’t be a confidence vote. Why would it when he was obviously going to win and no one would dare vote against him. And why couldn’t people just concentrate on everything he had done to make their lives better. Prices still rising, the economy stagnant. It was delusional stuff. Straight out of the Boris Johnson playbook. Talking of which, the Convict was into his second day of giving evidence at the Covid inquiry. He was no more coherent or prepared than he had been on day one. Almost as if he had set out to deliberately insult the bereaved families. He hadn’t actually meant to kill so many people. Just hadn’t been that bothered about them one way or another. And there had definitely never been any parties in No 10. Not even the ones where there was photographic evidence. No one had been shagging in cupboards. Drinking from the bottle. There’s a polite word for this: clusterfuck. An incompetent Tory party falling apart. But it’s worse than that. Everywhere you turn there is the stench of corruption. Of a government whose sole purpose is to live another day. Even the Maybot was better than this. Sunak was right about one thing. Enough is enough. This can’t go on.

       "     'bodyText': 'Rishi Sunak has vowed to “finish the job” of getting his Rwanda plan off the ground as he batted away questions about his future and fought to regain control of his mutinous party. The former home secretary Suella Braverman has denied spreading poison within her own party to get rid of Rishi Sunak. Boris Johnson said there was nothing he could have reasonably done to stop lockdown-breaking parties in Downing Street, calling media coverage and TV adaptations of these events “absurd” and “a travesty of the truth”. Boris Johnson has told the Covid inquiry that he assumed Rishi Sunak’s flagship “eat out to help out” hospitality scheme had been cleared by government scientists and was surprised to learn later that it had not. Russian spies have been targeting British MPs, peers, civil servants, journalists and others with cyber-hacking since 2015 as part of a concerted attempt to meddle in British politics, a Foreign Office minister has said. The Conservatives raised three times as much as Labour in the last quarter boosted by £10m from the will of supermarket tycoon John Sainsbury, showing they are on course to benefit from No 10’s decision to raise election spending limits. The BBC’s governing body has said the UK’s creative sector will be hit by the government’s decision to limit the expected licence fee increase to £10, after the culture secretary confirmed a below-inflation rise. David Cameron has said that American lives could be at stake if the US Senate does not approve more military aid to Ukraine. As the BBC’s James Landale reports, he made the comments in a speech in Washington, where the Senate is blocking a further financial aid package. In a thread starting here, Landale says Cameron, the new foreign secretary, said supporting Ukraine was in America’s self-interest. UK Foreign Secretary @David_Cameron makes a punchy intervention in US domestic politics. On a visit to Washington, he tells policymakers American lives could be at risk if they do not vote through new money for Ukraine. This only hours after the Senate blocked £61bn for Kyiv. He told the Aspen Security Forum he was “worried” the US and the West were not giving Ukraine the support it needed against invading Russian forces &amp; said they had to help Ukraine through the winter so it could rebuild in the spring. “Anything less than that is a victory for Putin,” Lord Cameron said. “If we let him win in Ukraine, it will be somewhere else next and it won’t just be American money that’s at risk. It might be a Nato country so it could be American lives.” He added: “If that money doesn’t get voted through, there are only two people that will be smiling. One of them is Vladimir Putin in Russia. The other one is Xi Jinping. And I don’t know about you but I don’t want to give either of those people a Christmas present.” Lord Cameron challenged and rejected arguments made by some Republican senators, namely that Ukraine’s military campaign was failing, that Europe was not pulling its weight, that the strategy was not clear enough and that Ukraine was corrupt. He said Ukraine had sunk 1\/5th of Russia’s Black Sea fleet, European countries were giving twice as much support as the US, the strategy was to back Ukraine through the winter &amp; rebuild in the spring &amp; Ukraine now had tougher anti-corruption laws than both US &amp; the UK. In an article for the Guardian, Henry Hill, the deputy editor of the ConservativeHome website, argues that one reason why Rishi Sunak is focusing on small boats is because the Tory record on overall immigration is so poor. Hill argues: When James Cleverly, the home secretary, claims that the government’s latest proposals will cut immigration by 300,000, that huge number won’t even take the annual inflow back to where it was when the Conservatives first entered government. This is why Sunak keeps focusing on Rwanda, and the broader question of asylum, despite the enormous difficulty the government is having getting the scheme off the ground: to try to use it as a shorthand for being “tough on immigration”, without having to admit that since 2019 the Conservatives have been running perhaps one of the most laissez-faire immigration policies in modern British history. This problem predates Sunak. But the fact is that that neither he nor his predecessors wanted to confront the hard choices that reducing the UK’s reliance on imported labour would entail. They have instead repeatedly talked tough, and installed a rightwinger at the Home Office with the impossible task of sorting the issue out, while allowing other departments such as education, business, and the Treasury to keep pushing policies that drive the numbers ever higher … Focusing on the troubled Rwanda scheme is the closest Sunak has got to answering an impossible question: how do you campaign on being tough on immigration when your record says the opposite? I suspect that next year he will learn the hard truth: you can’t. While it is Conservative MPs whose positions will determine the fate of Sunak’s legislation, the views of the party’s membership, who have tended to be more rightwing than those in parliament, is harder to quantify Paul Goodman, the editor of ConservativeHome, said a survey which the website had carried out in July found seven out of 10 Conservative activists believe the UK should leave the European convention on human rights. He said: In terms of how they feel about this legislation now, a certain amount depends on what positions they see Eurosceptics they support taking. Though her support among MPs may be limited, some members will look for a lead from Suella Braverman, although the picture there is also complicated. When members were surveyed on whether Sunak was right to sack her as home secretary, half said he was wrong but two in five said he was right, which is a substantial minority. The Conservative party chair, Richard Holden, told reporters at a press gallery lunch his party still has a “fighting chance” of winning the next general election. He said: I wanted to come in here today to tell you and especially my colleagues in the room, that the fight is not over, despite what Labour seem to think … Our opponents may think it is a forgone conclusion and try to keep their heads down because whenever they put them up, they make a mistake. But it’s clear to me that the fight isn’t over and it has a few facets to it. Holden criticised Keir Starmer for making a number of U-turns and not standing up to Jeremy Corbyn when antisemitism was at its peak in the party. On Starmer’s praise for Margaret Thatcher, Holden said the “public see him as a shapeshifting child. A major issue for him is that he means to stand for something that he can’t stand for.” The Tory chair also said his party would be ready for a general election from February 2024. The chair of an influential group of Conservative MPs who include many from “red wall” constituencies said he believes they would support Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda legislation. John Stevenson, the Carlisle MP who chairs the Northern Research Group, said: I think that it will be overwhelmingly supported by northern MPs. Some may have wanted it to be more robust but I think that most will support it and I would be surprised if anybody went against it. Immigration a big issue in all of seats in the north of England and I view this as another stage in the government approach, so let’s bring forward the legislation. My attitude is that if it doesn’t work then you would need to revisit the whole issue. George Osborne has suggested that one reason Boris Johnson was not fully focused on Covid in early 2020 was because he was working out how to pay off a big tax bill. The former Tory chancellor floated the theory, without offering any firm evidence to back it up, on his Political Currency podcast which he co-hosts with Ed Balls. Osborne and Johnson have a rivalry dating back to the time when they were both seen as likely successors to David Cameron as prime minister, and Johnson’s successful leadership of the leave campaign in 2016 in effect killed off Osborne’s political career. In February 2020 Johnson spent a long period at Chevening, a government grace-and-favour country home, while Chequers was being refurbished. In his witness statement to the Covid inquiry, Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s former chief adviser, said Johnson was “on holiday for a fortnight” dealing with his divorce, the announcement of his engagement, and accusations about him in the media from an ex-girlfriend. Cummings also said Johnson wanted to work on his Shakespeare biography. Johnson’s allies have dismissed the Shakespeare book claim, and at the Covid inquiry yesterday Johnson said he was holding some work meetings during the Chevening period. But the former PM has not given a full account of how he spent that time. Osborne said on his podcast: I think he [Johnson] hits a kind of financial crunch in early 2020. Because he’s basically taken the job of prime minister, which is a big pay cut for him. He has a big tax bill to pay, because he was giving speeches for money in that period between when he was foreign secretary and prime minister. And he wouldn’t have put aside money to pay HMRC a few years later … Because he’s bust he can’t deal with Covid. That is a theory about what happened in February. It didn’t really surface, put it this way, at the Covid inquiry, but it’s a personal pet theory of mine of why he disappears in February. In response, a spokesperson for Johnson said: This is total and transparent nonsense and is also in contradiction of the evidence which was presented at the inquiry; it shows that Mr Johnson was working in this period, including attending meetings in person in Downing Street, receiving box work and taking part in Covid-relevant discussions. Tory civil wars have “completely reopened”, George Osborne has claimed. Speaking on his Political Currency podcast, which he co-hosts with Ed Balls, the former Tory chancellor said the events of this week had undermined Rishi Sunak’s claim to be a force for stability. Osborne said: The Tory civil wars have completely reopened. Rishi Sunak’s big claim was, ‘I’ve come after the chaos of Boris Johnson and the chaos of Liz Truss … I’ve stabilised things.’ He can’t now claim anymore to have stabilised things. His government is fragmenting around this immigration issue. Osborne also said he did not think that Robert Jenrick’s decision to resign yesterday was just motivated by a dispute over policy. “You’ve got to be thinking he’s also positioning himself for what’s going to come in the Tory party,” Osborne said. One group of lawyers inspecting Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda legislation are expected to return their judgment to rightwing Consevative MPs before Tuesday’s vote, PA Media reports. The European Research Group (ERG) chair and MP Mark Francois said: We all agree with the prime minister that we need to stop the boats but the legislation to do this must be assuredly fit for purpose. To that end, spoke with Sir Bill Cash, who confirmed his star chamber team are already analysing the Rwanda bill, in detail. This may still take a few days to complete but he was confident their findings will be available, at the very latest, prior to the second reading debate on Tuesday. The New Conservatives and Common Sense groups are also interested in the verdict, PA says. When Rishi Sunak became Conservative leader, he was significantly more popular with the public than his party. A big question in politics was whether he would drag his party up (with people taking a more positive view of the Tories, because Sunak was leading them), or whether the opposite would happen. Now the answer is clear. As new polling from Ipsos confirms, being Tory leader seems to have had a dire impact on Sunak’s popularity. Keiran Pedley, director of politics at Ipsos, said: At the start of the year the prime minister’s personal poll ratings were stronger than his party’s. In January, Rishi Sunak held a net favourability rating of -9 whilst the Conservative party stood at -26. Today Mr Sunak’s stands at -28 and the Conservative party -33. A year of public concern about the cost of living, NHS and immigration now mean Mr Sunak is almost as unpopular as the party he leads as he grapples with how to turn their collective fortunes around in 2024. New from @IpsosUK. 2023: The year Rishi Sunak became (almost) as unpopular as his party Net favourability Jan 2023 Sunak: -9 Conservatives: -26 November 2023 Sunak: -28 Conservatives: -33 A reader asks: Do we have a timetable for passage through Lords for Rwanda bill? Surely this is unlikely to get through the Lord’s without amendment? We don’t even have a timetable for the passage of the bill through the Commons. During business questions this morning Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, said the second reading would take place on Tuesday next week. But she did not say when the remaining stages would be debated, even though she announced provisional business in the Commons up until Tuesday 19 December, when the Christmas recess starts. It is possible the bill could clear the Commons before 19 December; it is not unusual for the government to schedule new debates at short notice. But in the Lords there is no mechanism by which the government can force legislation through quickly against the wishes of the opposition. Peers will probably want to spend a few weeks on it. And, you’re right – it is unlikely to pass without amendments. Humza Yousaf, Scotland’s first minister, has described the UK government’s plan to slash immigration as marking a “real dark day” for Britain. Speaking at first minister’s questions, in response to a question from the SNP MSP Clare Haughey specifically about the plan to stop people on care worker visas bringing dependants with them, Yousaf said: It’s a real dark day for the UK, a country that once welcomed immigrants, including my grandfather, to the country. In fact, begged him to come and others to come to work in their factories, to drive buses, due to the labour shortages that were seen at that time. As PA Media reports, Yousaf’s grandfather came to Scotland from Pakistan in the 1960s to work in a sewing machine factory in Clydebank. Yousaf argued that Labour and Conservative governments were both responsible over the years for making immigration rules increasingly restrictive. He said: What successive UK governments have done – Labour and Conservatives – is they have, bit by bit, dismantled our immigration and indeed our asylum processes. On immigration, the latest announcements mean that we’re asking – the UK government is asking – migrants to come here to look after our own family members but doing so by abandoning their own family members back home. On asylum, the UK government has virtually eliminated any practical legal route for those that are fleeing war or persecution. The policies of the UK government in this respect are not only morally repugnant, but they are economically illiterate. The SNP, the Scottish government, values migration. We value the importance of it to our social fabric but also to our economy, and let me say unequivocally that in Scotland, the Scottish government will always say that we are proud of the benefits that migrants bring to this country, and we are proud that they have chosen Scotland to be their home. The Institute for Government thinktank has published an analysis of the Rwanda bill by Sir Jonathan Jones, a former head of the government’s legal department. He confirms Rishi Sunak’s argument that the bill would stop most, but not all, legal challenges to a deportation order to Rwanda. Jones says: Clause 4 does to a limited extent allow claims on the grounds that Rwanda is not a safe country for a particular person “based on compelling evidence relating specifically to the person’s individual circumstances” (rather than grounds that Rwanda is not a safe country in general). However such claims are excluded if they relate to the risk of someone being subject to refoulement from Rwanda to another country – in other words they must relate to the safety of conditions for the individual in Rwanda itself. What the bill cannot do is prevent claimants going to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg if they have been unable to enforce their rights in the domestic courts. The Strasbourg court would not be bound by the UK-Rwanda treaty or by the UK legislation. It would perform its own assessment, on the latest evidence available, as to whether there was a breach of the ECHR. The One Nation caucus of Conservative MPs, which represents “moderates” in the party who support staying party to the European convention on human rights, are expressing doubts about the Rwanda bill, Kevin Schofield from HuffPost UK reports. At Rishi Sunak’s press conference he was asked by Christopher Hope, from GB News, about a GB News report claiming the Rwanda policy is treated as a joke by people smugglers. (See 11.35am.) In its report GB News quoted a source “with intimate knowledge of the smuggling gangs in the camps of northern France” who told the channel: Mention Rwanda now and people here in the camps just laugh. It’s become the butt of jokes around here. The migrants are well aware of the difficulties the UK government is having around this policy. The threat hasn’t put anyone off from coming here, because no one thinks for a second they’d be heading to Rwanda if they make it to the UK. The BBC licence fee will rise by £10.50 to £169.50 a year, the culture secretary, Lucy Frazer, has confirmed. In a statement to MPs, Frazer also announced a review of the licence fee that will consider alternative funding models. In a news release the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said: The review, supported by a panel of independent experts soon to be announced from across the broadcasting sector and wider business world, will assess a range of options for funding the BBC. It will look at how alternative models could help secure the broadcaster’s long-term sustainability amid an evolving media landscape, increased competition and changing audience behaviour, while reducing the burden on licence fee payers. Under its terms of reference, the review will consider various issues including “whether the BBC should provide more services to audiences on a fully commercial basis, and what those services could be” and “how the BBC could transition to any new funding model”. The names of those leading the review have not yet been announced. This was the second press conference Rishi Sunak has held at No 10 within a month about the Rwanda deportation policy. The first came on the day of the supreme court judgment saying the policy was unlawful and on that occasion he sought to win over Tory MPs by promising “emergency legislation” (even though the emergency bill he was proposing was not the same as what they wanted). Today the bill is out, and Sunak stressed that it included “notwithstanding clauses”, even though they are not the hardcore “notwithstanding clauses” sought by rightwingers. Sunak’s will disapply parts of the Human Rights Act; Suella Braverman and her allies want clauses that will disapply all or parts of the European convention on human rights. Sunak was eloquent today when arguing that his bill is strong enough to ensure deportation flights to Rwanda will take off. But it is not yet clear whether his legal arguments are as robust as his rhetoric, and today he sounded more uncertain and defensive than he did when going over this ground last month. He said four times that he was “confident” his plan would work, but the more he said it, the less confident he sounded. And perhaps the biggest takeaway of all came from the questions; the Daily Mail, the Sun and the GB News, which are normally quite favourable to the Tories, all asked sceptical or hostile questions. Here is the text of Sunak’s opening statement. And here are the main points from the statement and the Q&amp;A. Sunak claimed the new bill will close down the vast majority of the legal routes used by asylum seekers who have challenged decisions to deport them to Rwanda. He said: Let me just go through the ways individual illegal migrants try and stay. Claiming asylum – that’s now blocked. Abuse of our Modern Slavery rules – blocked. The idea that Rwanda isn’t safe – blocked. The risk of being sent on to some other country - blocked. And spurious Human Rights claims – you’d better believe we’ve blocked those too … because we’re completely disapplying all the relevant sections of the Human Rights Act. And not only have we blocked all these ways illegal migrants will try and stay. We’ve also blocked their ability to try and stay by bringing a Judicial Review on any of those grounds. That means that this bill blocks every single reason that has ever been used to prevent flights to Rwanda from taking off. The only, extremely narrow exception will be if you can prove with credible and compelling evidence …. that you specifically have a real and imminent risk of serious and irreversible harm … I am telling you now, we have set the bar so high that it will be vanishingly rare for anyone to meet it. He said the UK was willing to ignore injunctions from the European court of human right seeking to block deportation flights. He said: I will not allow a foreign court to block these flights. If the Strasbourg court chooses to intervene against the express wishes of our sovereign parliament, I will do what is necessary to get flights off. And today’s new law already makes clear that the decision on whether to comply with interim measures issued by the European court is a decision for British government ministers – and British government ministers alone. Ignoring injunctions from the ECtHR is not the same as ignoring all judgments from it. He claimed that there was only “an inch” between his stance and that of his Tory critics who want a tougher bill. And if he agreed to their demand (for a bill allowing the UK to ignore the ECHR), Rwanda would pull out, he said. For the people who say ‘you should do something different’, the difference between them and me is an inch, given everything that we have closed. We’re talking about an inch. That inch by the way is the difference between the Rwandans participating in this scheme and not. He challenged Labour to back the bill. (See 11.18am.) He said next week’s second reading vote on the bill would not be a confidence matter. (See 12.12pm.) He ducked a question about whether voters would be entitled not to trust him if Rwanda flights were still not taking place by the time of the next election. At his press conference Rishi Sunak was asked if No 10 would treat next week’s vote on the Rwanda bill as a confidence vote. His answer was not entirely clear, but No 10 has confirmed that he said no. Treating the second reading vote as a confidence vote would mean that any Tory MP who voted against, or perhaps even abstained, would lose the whip, and could be banned from standing as a candidate at the next election. That might seem like an attractive option for No 10, but designating a division as a confidence vote can easily backfire because MPs view it as an extreme measure, and an act of desperation. Liz Truss resigned as PM the day after a bungled threat to treat a vote on fracking as a confidence issue. This is from ITV’s Paul Brand. Asked whether they think the right of the party are willing to push Rishi Sunak to the brink, one Conservative MP replies, “Yes. They’re lunatics.” The Russian Federal Security Service has used “cyber interference” to target MPs, journalists and others as part of attempts to “meddle in British politics”, the Foreign Office minister Leo Docherty has told the Commons. He made the announcement in a statement taking place around the same time as Rishi Sunak’s press conference. Rowena Mason has the story. Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, has told MPs that the second reading of the safety of Rwanda (asylum and immigration) bill will take place on Tuesday next week. Victoria Prentis, the attorney general, has rejected calls from Labour to publish her legal advice to the government about the legality of the safety of Rwanda (asylum and immigration) bill yesterday. In response to a question in the Commons from Emily Thornberry, her Labour opposite number, Prentis said that she was not allowed to discuss her legal advice to the government and she said the government only published a summary of its legal advice “in very, very rare circumstances”, such as ahead of military action. She also said the section 19 (1) (b) statement on the face of the bill, from James Cleverly, the home secretary, saying he was unable to say the bill was compatible with the European convention on human rights, was not unprecedented. Asked if she was comfortable with the bill, Prentis said: I take very seriously my obligations to encourage government to act in a lawful manner and to make sure that government is acting in a lawful manner both on the international and the domestic front. And when Andy Slaughter (Lab) asked if there was any significance in the fact that her name is not included on the face of the bill in the lists of minister backing it (Michael Tomlinson, solicitor general until this morning, is named instead), Prentis replied: I can’t give the details of the legal advice that I have been giving the government – or whether or not I have been giving such advice – from this despatch box, and that remains the case. I remain very comfortable in my role and I will hope that I remain in this role to give the government legal advice for a long time to come. Prentis was reportedly firmly opposed to the government publishing an even tougher version of the bill that would have allowed the UK to ignore parts of the European convention on human rights. Some previous attorneys general, such as Suella Braverman, have been more relaxed about challenging international law. Q: [From GB News] We have been to Calais and found people smugglers are laughing at the UK’s Rwanda policy. Are they entitled to do that? Sunak says, look at the results. Crossings this year are down by a third. And many people have been arrested. He says 22,000 people have been returned. So what they are doing is making a difference, he says. Cooperation with the French is working, he says. He talks about barriers being erected in French rivers stopping boats getting to the coast. He is confident that this will work, he says. And it is the only approach that would work, he says. He repeats his call for Labour to support the bill. And that’s it. Q: [From the Sun] If no flight leaves to Rwanda before the election, are voters entitled to say they no longer trust you? Sunak gives a list of areas where he claims he has delivered. The British people will get to decide. He is confident that the British people will see that, he says. Q: [From the Daily Mail] Jenrick said this bill was a triumph of hope over experience. He is right, isn’t he? It is not going to work. Sunak does not accept that. He says he is delivering on immigration. He is “entirely confident” about this, he says. He has worked through it with multiple lawyers. This is the toughest legislation on this decision. He stresses, again, that the bill contains a notwithstanding clause. He claims the bill blocks every avenue used in the past to obstruct deportations. He says the difference between him and his Tory critics is only “an inch”. But that inch of difference is what ensures Rwanda still backs the scheme, he says. Q: You have lost control of your party. Will you call an election if you lose these votes? Sunak says small-boat numbers are down by a third. Legal enforcement raids are up. Thousands of migrants in the country illegally have had their bank accounts closed. What is happening is “ridiculous”, he says. He says he wants to finish the job. This is a top priority for the country. He is focused on delivering. Q: What if you lose? Sunak says he is confident that he can win the vote. He wants this bill on the statute book in record time. He claims his track record shows he can get things done. If Labour “get the values of the British people”, they will vote for the bill, he says. Q: Will you treat next week’s vote as a confidence vote? Sunak says the real question about next week is for the Labour party. He says he has a plan. But Labour doesn’t have one. The real question is, what will Labour do. (Pat McFadden, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, confirmed this morning that Labour will oppose it.) Sunak is now taking questions. Q: Are you saying to your MPs back me or sack me? Sunak says he is saying to the country his patience is running thin. They have to end the legal merry-go-round and get deportations to Rwanda up and running. What is happening is “patently unfair”, he says. Sunak says he did not agree with the supreme court’s judgment, but he respects it. The bill will address the concerns it has. The supreme court was commenting on conditions in Rwanda 18 months ago, he says. The bill includes notwithstanding clauses. This means people will not be able to use domestic law to challenge decisions to deport them. He lists a series of reasons migrants might try to use to challenge a decision to deport them. They have all been blocked. He says the only challenge that might be allowed would be if someone could prove, with credible evidence, that they were at real risk of harm if they were sent abroad. He says without this provision, Rwanda would not have agreed to the scheme. And in that case the scheme would have collapsed. He says this is an “extremely narrow” exception. It means the prospect of a challenge succeeding will be “vanishingly rare”. (This is the point Chris Heaton-Harris was making this morning – see 10.40am.) UPDATE: Sunak said: That means that this bill blocks every single reason that has ever been used to prevent flights to Rwanda from taking off. The only, extremely narrow exception will be if you can prove with credible and compelling evidence that you specifically have a real and imminent risk of serious and irreversible harm. We have to recognise that as a matter of law – and if we didn’t, we’d undermine the treaty we’ve just signed with Rwanda. As the Rwandans themselves have made clear, if we go any further the entire scheme will collapse. And there’s no point having a bill with nowhere to send people to. But I am telling you now, we have set the bar so high that it will be vanishingly rare for anyone to meet it. Rishi Sunak says he is holding this press conference to explain why the government is publishing its Rwanda bill. He says he is the child of immigrants. He understands why people want to come to the UK. But his parents came here legally, he says. If people are allowed to come to the UK illegally, that will destroy people’s trust in the system, he says. Michael Tomlinson has been appointed to replace Robert Jenrick as immigration minister, No 10 has announced. Tomlinson was the solicitor general. He will be a minister of state at the Home Office, with the official title of “minister for illegal migration”, and he will attend cabinet. Tom Pursglove, who was the minister for disabled people, has also been moved to the Home Office, as “minister for legal migration and delivery”. And Robert Courts has been promoted to replace Tomlinson as solicitor general. He was the chair of the defence committee, but will have to stand down. These appointments are likely to go down well with the Tory right. Tomlinson is a former deputy chair of the European Research Group, and Pursglove is a vocal Brexiter. In her Today programme interview this morning Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, said she was opposed to the Rwanda bill published yesterday because it would allow asylum seekers to use the courts to challenge the decision to remove them. She said the bill would allow “a whole raft of individual claims to be made by people that we might seek to remove to Rwanda” and that these legal challenges could take months or years. But in his interviews this morning Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, claimed the bill would only allow legal challenges in rare circumstances. He told GB News: You’ll be really having to go some way to be able to prove that you’ll be in immediate harm or danger if you went to Rwanda to be pulled off a flight. I think the chances of that are … vanishingly small. And on BBC Breakfast, Heaton-Harris said these legal challenges would only happen in a “very, very small number of matters, like misidentification”. In his LBC interview this morning Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, played down the significance of Robert Jenrick’s resignation last night as immigration minister over the Rwanda bill. He said: I don’t think it’s as big a story as is being made. I generally don’t like anybody resigning from my party … [but] when I was Boris’s chief whip pretty much everybody did, so maybe I have a sense of scale and proportion that others don’t. Rishi Sunak will be holding a press conference at 11am, No 10 has announced. We’ll have a live stream of it in the blog shortly before 11. You may need to refresh the page to see it. Rishi Sunak will give evidence to the Covid inquiry for most of Monday, the inquiry has announced. He is scheduled to appear in the morning, starting at 10.30am, and again for a session in the afternoon. He will be asked about his time as chancellor during the pandemic, and he is the last witness scheduled to appear before the inquiry hears closing statements from lawyers later next week at the end of module two, which has been looking at “decision making and political governance”. With so much happening today, I’ll be covering the crisis in the Conservative party, and other Westminster political stories, here. And my colleague Sammy Gecsoyler will be covering Boris Johnson at the Covid inquiry on a separate live blog here. Here are the main lines from Suella Braverman’s interview on the Today programme. Braverman, the former home secretary, claimed that she was not actively plotting to bring down Rishi Sunak as Tory leader and she claimed she hoped he would lead the party into the next election. (See 9.14am.) She said: I want the prime minister to succeed in stopping the boats. He said he would do whatever it takes. I’m telling him there is a way to succeed in stopping the boats and fulfilling that promise. If we do it, if he does it as prime minister, he will be able to lead us into the next election telling the people we have succeeded on this very important pledge. She rejected claims the Conservative party had a “death wish”. She said the Rwanda bill published yesterday would not work. She explained: There are elements that should be welcomed in this new bill that the prime minister has presented. But taken as a whole and looking at the reality of the challenges that are involved in detaining people, removing people and getting them to Rwanda – this is a very litigious field and there are lots of legal frameworks that apply – the reality is and the sorry truth is that it won’t work and it will not stop the boats. She said the bill needed to be changed “to totally exclude international law – the refugee convention, other broader avenues of legal challenge”. She defended her habit of making controversial and provocative statements. She said: The truth is that when I served as home secretary I sought to be honest; honest to the British people, honest for the British people, and sometimes honesty is uncomfortable. But I’m not going to shy away from telling people how it is and from plain speaking, and if that upsets polite society then I’m sorry about that. But the point is that we need to be honest, we need to be clear-eyed about the situation right now. We can’t keep failing the British people. We have made promise after promise [on immigration]. We have put forward plan after plan. They have all failed. And we have now run out of time. Kevin Schofield from HuffPost has posted on X the text of Nick Robinson’s “spreading poison” question to Suella Braverman in full. Good morning. Boris Johnson is back at the Covid inquiry later this morning and, although yesterday was tough, today is likely to be even more challenging for him. He is expected to face questions on why he ignored calls from scientists for a second lockdown for weeks, why he repeatedly made comments in public suggesting he would be happy to see old people die if that was necessary to keep the economy open, and why he allowed Partygate. But if you think Johnson v Hugo Keith KC will be the best example today of a senior Tory giving implausible answers in response to hostile questioning, you probably weren’t listening to Suella Braverman being interviewed by Nick Robinson on the Today programme right now. Although the two stories are separate, they are not unrelated. Support for the Conservative party crashed as a direct result of Johnson’s leadership, and Partygate, both of which are being investigated by the inquiry. And if the Tories were not 20 points behind in the polls, it is hard to believe that their MPs would be at war with each other with such hostility. In her Today interview, Braverman’s biggest whopper came when she was asked if she thought Rishi Sunak should remain Conservative leader if he did not change his Rwanda policy. Braverman replied: No one’s talking about leadership, or changing leadership. Robinson replied: “That’s nonsense, and you know it’s nonsense.” He said Tory MPs were talking about a leadership challenge, and that Braverman had held meetings to discuss this herself. But that wasn’t even Robinson’s most hostile intervention. That came when he put it to Braverman that she was “a headline-grabber who does it by spreading poison, even within your own party”. In response, Braverman said she “sought to be honest”, and that honesty involved saying uncomfortable things. Braverman’s main argument was the one she also made yesterday in her personal statement to the Commons – that the Rwanda plan drawn up by Sunak did not go far enough. She also denied wanting to bring down Sunak. She claimed that she wanted him to succeed, and that she hoped he would lead the party into the next election. Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, was also interviewed on LBC this morning. Asked about the prospect of Sunak facing a leadership challenge, he replied: I think it’s highly unlikely, very unlikely. I’d say vanishingly small. At this point it is very hard to tell how the Tory crisis will unfold. For Sunak to face a confidence vote, 53 Conservative MPs would have to write to Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the 1922 Committee, requesting one. This seems unlikely before Christmas, but this time yesterday no one was even talking about this seriously as a potential outcome. Now it is conceivable. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: Boris Johnson resumes giving evidence to the Covid inquiry. 10.10am: Victoria Prentis, the attorney general, takes questions in the Commons. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.

       "     'bodyText': 'The former home secretary Suella Braverman has denied spreading poison within her own party to get rid of Rishi Sunak. In a combative interview after the resignation of the immigration minister, Robert Jenrick, on Wednesday, Braverman told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme she was a “plain speaker” and not trying to remove the prime minister. However, she refused to back Sunak’s Rwanda deportation plan, key to fulfilling one of his five pledges, insisting “the reality and sorry truth is, it just won’t work”. She also again warned the prime minister of the “perilous situation” the Conservatives found themselves in given his pledge to stop the boats at the start of the year. She made her remarks a day after delivering a personal statement in the House of Commons, in which she told MPs the Tories faced “electoral oblivion in a matter of months” unless ministers blocked all human rights laws used to halt deportation flights to Rwanda. “The facts don’t lie, and we need to deliver on a key promise. That’s how we will win the next general election,” Braverman told Today. “The time for talk, the time for slogans and promises is over. We need to show delivery and that’s what this debate right now is all about.” Braverman said she wanted Sunak to succeed in “stopping the boats as he said he would do whatever it takes”, but added that his draft bill would “allow a merry-go-round of legal claims and litigation”. The emergency bill will give ministers the power to ignore some judgments that come from Strasbourg while stopping short of leaving or “disapplying” the European convention on human rights in its entirety. Critics from the Conservative right have said that such a move raises the possibility that individual legal challenges would still be able stop planes taking off for Rwanda. The draft bill does not allow the government to override the international laws that have stopped it sending asylum seekers to central Africa, which pushed Jenrick to stand down from his role as immigration minister. Braverman was asked: “Isn’t the truth that you’re a headline grabber that does it by spreading poison even in your own party?” She replied: “The truth is that … I sought to be honest, and sometimes honesty is uncomfortable. If that upsets polite society, I’m sorry about that.” Jenrick, regarded until recently as a close political ally of Sunak, wrote in his resignation letter: “I am unable to take the currently proposed legislation through the Commons as I do not believe it provides us with the best possible chance of success. “A bill of the kind you are proposing is a triumph of hope over experience. The stakes for the country are too high for us not to pursue the stronger protections required to end the merry-go-round of legal challenges which risk paralysing the scheme and negating its intended deterrent.” Echoing Jenrick’s comments, Braverman said: “If you look at the wording of the bill, there are clear sections which allow a whole raft of individual claims to be made by people that we might seek to remove to Rwanda. “They will be able to bring those claims through the courts via judicial review. They will be able to challenge the decisions made by the secretary of state and those challenges could take months, and potentially sometimes years.” The former home secretary went on to emphasise on Thursday: “We can’t can’t tweak at this problem. We can’t do half measures. We have to totally exclude international law, refugee convention or the border avenues of legal challenge … people will bring legal claims.” Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, attempted to play down Tory divisions over the Rwanda policy. Asked if the vote on the safety of the Rwanda bill would be treated as a matter of confidence in the prime minister, he said that was a decision for the whips but he could not see why it would need to be as “all Conservatives will vote for it”. The cabinet minister told Sky News: “The policy of stopping the boats is something that actually does unite the Conservative party. “There’s elements in this bill where people would like to go further … there’s also people that say this goes too far. I actually think this bill strikes the right balance. It is a really strong group of measures to try and stop the boats in a completely legal and justifiable way. And I think it will work.”'},\n",

       "     'bodyText': 'Thanks so much for following events with us. We are closing this blog now, you can read all our UK politics coverage here. The immigration minister, Robert Jenrick, has quit, just hours after the prime minister tabled a bill to save the Rwanda deportation policy. He stood down after the legislation did not allow ministers to override international laws which have stopped the government from sending asylum seekers to central Africa. Jenrick, who was appointed in October 2022, said the emergency legislation introduced to revive the Rwanda policy had “moved towards my position” but the Bill was “a triumph of hope over experience”. Rishi Sunak has described Jenrick’s resignation as “disappointing”, telling him in a letter he fears it was “based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the situation”. The government earlier published emergency legislation aimed at shoring up its Rwanda asylum policy after it was ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court last month. The home secretary, James Cleverly, told the Commons the legislation will prevent further legal challenges to deportation flights but Jenrick said in his resignation letter the draft law “does not go far enough”. The Rwandan government has in effect confirmed what Rishi Sunak told Tory MPs about it being responsible for blocking a bill that would have disapplied the European convention on human rights. Vincent Biruta, the Rwandan foreign affairs minister, released a statement saying its deportation deal with the UK must meet “the highest standards of international law”. During his evidence to the Covid inquiry, Boris Johnson said it is “nonsense” to claim he kept Matt Hancock as health secretary so he could be a sacrifice for the inquiry. Johnson also told the inquiry in London he is “deeply sorry” about the pain and suffering experienced during the pandemic. Johnson insisted he does not recall being told in a Cobra meeting conclusion from 26 February 2020 that mass deaths were increasingly likely. He also admitted regrets for previously saying that long Covid was “bollocks” and “Gulf War syndrome stuff”. In his letter to Jenrick, Sunak wrote: “Your resignation is disappointing given we both agree on the ends, getting flights off to Rwanda so that we can stop the boats. I fear that your departure is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the situation. It is our experience that gives us confidence that this will work. “Our returns deal with Albania, that you were instrumental in securing, has cut Albanian arrivals by 90% … “This [Rwanda] bill is the toughest piece of illegal migration legislation ever put forward by a UK government. It makes clear that Parliament deems Rwanda safe and no court can second guess that… “If we were to oust the courts entirely, we would collapse the entire scheme. The Rwandan government have been clear that they would not accept the UK basing this scheme on legislation that could be considered in breach of our international law obligations. There would be no point in passing a law that would leave us with nowhere to send people to.” Sunak has described Robert Jenrick’s resignation as “disappointing”, telling him in a letter he fears it was “based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the situation”. You can read our full report into Robert Jenrick’s resignation – and what it means for Rishi Sunak – here. Jenrick entered the Commons as MP for Newark in Nottinghamshire in a 2014 by-election, Press Association reminds us. Theresa May promoted him to a Treasury minister in January 2018 and he was made housing secretary by Boris Johnson when he took office in July 2019. But his time around the cabinet table ended in controversy, when he was sacked after a string of high-profile and damaging accusations. His departure followed the unlawful approval of a Tory donor’s housing development and eyebrow-raising journeys during lockdown. Johnson stuck by Jenrick despite anger over his approval of media mogul Richard Desmond’s 1,500-home Westferry Printworks development in east London. The permission came the day before a new council community levy would have cost Desmond’s company an extra £40m. Jenrick later had to quash his own approval, conceding the decision was “unlawful” due to “apparent bias”. There was also criticism over Jenrick’s decision to travel 150 miles from his London property to his Herefordshire home, and then journeying for more than an hour to visit his parents in Shropshire while the country was in Covid lockdown. He later lost his post in a reshuffle. The arrival of Liz Truss in Number 10 saw Jenrick return to government for a short stint in the Department of Health. Then in October 2022, with Rishi Sunak taking the top job, Jenrick was appointed immigration minister. Labour’s national campaign coordinator Pat McFadden said: “This latest chaotic chapter demonstrates why the country is ready for change. And Keir Starmer’s changed Labour Party stands ready. “The British people deserve a government that will fix the issues that matter to working people, not a Tory circus of gimmicks and leadership posturing.” Jenrick, who was appointed in October 2022, also said the emergency legislation introduced to revive the Rwanda policy had “moved towards my position” but the Bill was “a triumph of hope over experience”. He said: “In our discussions on the proposed emergency legislation you have moved towards my position, for which I am grateful. “Nevertheless. I am unable to take the currently proposed legislation through the Commons as I do not believe it provides us with the best possible chance of success. “A Bill of the kind you are proposing is a triumph of hope over experience. The stakes for the country are too high for us not to pursue the stronger protections required to end the merry-go-round of legal challenges which risk paralysing the scheme and negating its intended deterrent.” In the letter to Rishi Sunak, Jenrick said the small boats crisis was doing “untold damage” to the country and the government needed to place “national interests highly contested interpretations of international law”. He added: “As you know, I have been pushing for the strongest possible piece of emergency legislation to ensure that under the Rwanda policy we remove as many small boat arrivals, as swiftly as possible to generate the greatest deterrent effect. “This stems from my firmly held position that the small boats crisis is a national emergency that is doing untold damage to our country, and the only way we will be able to stop the boats completely is by urgently introducing a major new deterrent. “I have therefore consistently advocated for a clear piece of legislation that severely limits the opportunities for domestic and foreign courts to block or undermine the effectiveness of the policy.” Robert Jenrick has officially announced his resignation on X, saying “I cannot continue in my position when I have such strong disagreements with the direction of the Government’s policy on immigration.” That brings the Commons’ reaction to the home seecretary’s Rwanda statement to an end. The Guardian’s Pippa Crerar on Robert Jenrick’s resignation. Cleverly, asked how the Bill can comply with international law when its front page states the Home Secretary cannot say it is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, told the Commons: “Because what the statement says on the front of the Bill is clear, the words are unambiguous. “But also I am absolutely certain that we are in accordance with international law, the two are not interchangeable.” Conservative former immigration minister Kevin Foster asked if Ministry of Defence aircraft could be used to transfer people to Rwanda, with Mr Cleverly replying: “I don’t want at this point to go into too much detail of all the operational procedures, but I can reassure him we’re thinking about the logistics of that.” Conservative former minister Mark Francois said the Home Secretary had “pointedly ducked” questions about individual appeals. He asked: “As every person we would seek to send to Rwanda is an individual, if under this legislation those people could continue to appeal and appeal in order to delay being put on a flight, what’s the point of the Bill?” Cleverly, in his reply, said: “An appeal process is an important part of a new legal process, it will not preclude people from being sent to Rwanda on this scheme.” The provision of individual appeals is not related to the safety of Rwanda, the home secretary said. James Cleverly’s comments were in response to a question from Conservative former minister Dr Caroline Johnson, who said: “There is a provision as he said for individual claims, can he tell what circumstances such an individual could expect to be successful? And how long that and the appeals process will be expected to take?” Cleverly said: “The provision of individual claims is not to do with the safety of Rwanda, that’s an important distinction that needs to be made. “Of course there does need to be provisions for appeals, that’s a normal part of any judicial or legal process.” Cleverly has now confirmed that Robert Jenrick has resigned as immigration minister. “That has been confirmed,” Cleverly said after repeated questioning. The immigration minister, Robert Jenrick, has quit, just hours after the prime minister tabled a bill to save the Rwanda deportation policy. He stood down after the legislation did not allow ministers to override international laws which have stopped the government from sending asylum seekers to central Africa. Jenrick’s resignation will be seen as a move to position himself as the head of a growing rightwing rebellion aimed at ensuring that the UK can act unilaterally and send flights to Kigali. James Cleverly will be judged for “decades” on the impact of the Government’s new Rwanda treaty and emergency bill, a senior Conservative backbencher has claimed. Tory former minister Sir John Hayes, a close ally of ex-home secretary Suella Braverman, told the Commons: “The new Home Secretary will of course be aware and welcome the fact that he will be… judged by the effectiveness of this legislation for weeks and months and years, perhaps decades even. “So will he confirm that the provisions in this Bill are sufficient to resist individual challenges from those who might be sent to Rwanda, and the interest groups and the dodgy lawyers who support them? And in particular would he speak specifically about the disapplication of Rule 39?” Rule 39 orders from European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg have been used to suspend attempts to deport migrants in the past. Cleverly replied: “The right is for ministers to decide on our response to a Rule 39 application, that is in the Bill. He is right that this sets important precedents. The European court of human rights would benefit from “evolution” and “updating”, Cleverly told the Commons. The Conservative former home secretary Priti Patel asked for details of any assessments made “as to whether the disapplication of the Human Rights Act and other laws are robust and will stand up to the legal challenges and ensure ultimately the delivery and the implementation of this policy”. Cleverly said: “The UK takes its international obligations incredibly seriously. The Human Rights Act is in part being disapplied through this legislation” He said the UK was one of the founding members of the European court of human rights, adding: “We regard it as an important institution, but like many postwar institutions it would benefit from evolution, it would benefit from updating.” The home secretary added: “We have a robust legal system, we have a robust parliamentary system here in the UK. We should have some more self-confidence in those systems and use our experience to help capacity-building in partner countries like Rwanda.” The Home Office minister Laura Farris has said that Robert Jenrick has resigned as immigration minister. She told LBC: “I understand that he has.” Asked why, she said: “I don’t know, in all honesty. I just came from the chamber and found out after I connected to your show.” The Lib Dems’ Christine Jardine says the policy is “immoral”, “expensive” and “unworkable”. From Sky News’ Sam Coates. Cleverly again refuses to answer a question from Labour about the cost of sending an asylum seeker to Rwanda. The Times’ Aubrey Allegretti is reporting that Jenrick is on the brink of resigning. In response to the Rwanda draft bill, the Law Society of England and Wales president, Nick Emmerson, has said in a statement: “The UK government is seeking to overturn an evidence-based finding of fact by the supreme court and shield itself from accountability under both domestic and international law through this legislation. “For the second time this year and by its own admission, the government is unable to guarantee the bill will be compatible with the European convention on human rights. “The Rwanda scheme has never been the answer to tackling the asylum question. The government is risking the UK’s international reputation and its standing in the world to deliver a plan that can, at best, be described as gestural.” With Robert Jenrick still absent in the Commons, Cleverly tells the home affairs committee chair, Diana Johnson: “I have no doubt the immigration minister will be in front of her committee as promised.” Cleverly reiterates that the government will publish the cost of the Rwanda scheme on an annual basis. Amid the cries of “Where is Robert?” from the Labour benches, Cleverly sought to assure the Commons that there was no risk of refugees being returned to their countries of origin from Rwanda as a result of the treaty and new legislation. The home secretary told MPs: “It means that someone removed to that country will not be removed or sent to another country in contravention of any international law, and anyone who is seeking asylum or who has had asylum determination will have their claim determined and be treated in accordance with that country’s obligations under international law. “Anyone removed to Rwanda under the provisions of the treaty will not be removed from Rwanda except to the United Kingdom in a very small number of limited and extreme circumstances. “And should the UK request the return of any relocated person, Rwanda will make them available.” From the Guardian’s Pippa Crerar. Cleverly does not answer the questions and responds that the “mask has slipped” on the other side of the house, citing Labour’s support for giving money to countries to develop. Cooper fires off a series of questions including asking how much more money has been paid to Rwanda and if there is any deal for annual payments regardless if asylum seekers are sent there. Cooper also cites reports that the Rwandan government told Rishi Sunak that it did not want to be on the wrong side of international law. Cooper cites the former home secretary Suella Braverman calling the bill “fatally flawed” and that it will not stop the boats. In response, the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, describes it as “total chaos” and brings up the elephant in the room: where is the immigration minister Robert Jenrick? Cleverly says “other countries” have copied the UK’s plans on Rwanda but does not specify which ones. Cleverly adds that anyone removed from Rwanda under the treaty will not be removed from the African country unless to the UK in extreme circumstances. From GB News’ Christopher Hope. Cleverly says emergency legislation published today says Rwanda is a safe country to prevent courts “second guessing” the will of parliament. “We will introduce legislation tomorrow in the form of the safety of Rwanda (asylum and immigration) bill to give effect to the judgment of parliament that Rwanda is a safe country, notwithstanding UK law or any interpretation of international law.” The new treaty includes a new specialist appeals tribunal to consider individuals’ appeals against refused claims. Cleverly reiterates the government’s commitment to Rwanda and says it is a “vital partner to the UK”. He says flights will take place “as soon as possible”. On the supreme court judgment three weeks ago stating the removal of asylum seekers to Rwanda was unlawful, Cleverly says those concerns have been “conclusively answered” and changes have been made. The home secretary, James Cleverly, is about to give a statement in the Commons on the Rwanda treaty and bill. The Rwandan government has in effect confirmed what Rishi Sunak told Tory MPs about it being responsible for blocking a bill that would have disapplied the European convention on human rights. Vincent Biruta, the Rwandan foreign affairs minister, has released a statement saying its deportation deal with the UK must meet “the highest standards of international law”. ITV’s Paul Brand has the full statement. That’s all from me for today. Nadeem Badshah is now taking over. James Cleverly, the home secretary, will deliver a statement to MPs at 6pm on Rwanda. It will cover the treaty signed yesterday, and the bill published this afternoon. Eleni Courea from Politico has more on what happened at the 1922 Committee meeting. She says Rishi Sunak told his MPs that he could not publish a bill proposing to disapply the European convention on human rights because that would have been unacceptable to Rwanda. She has posted these on X. Rishi Sunak has just told Tory MPs at the 1922 committee that it’s time for them to make a choice whether they fight the Labour Party — or one another The PM has told MPs that it’s Rwanda — not him — who doesn’t want to be seen as breaching international law, according to a Tory source He argued that if the government went further to disapply international conventions, then Rwanda would want no part in it Theresa May has told the 1922 committee that “whatever the views of some people in this room” Rwanda is not what will determine the next election She said that instead the Tories need to focus on cost of living and economy and — in fact quieten the talk on Rwanda Significant win for Rishi Sunak - Bill Cash seems to have given his tentative backing to the bill At the 1922 committee Cash told MPs it seems robust and reasserts parliament’s sovereignty Sunak said “it is this Bill or it is nothing” Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, has recently become popular with the Tory right for the stance he has been taking on small boats, and on legal migration. He let it be known that he was pushing No 10 for much stronger measures, and he recently implied in the Commons that his own plans were blocked last year. There are reports tonight that he is unhappy with the Rwanda bill. This is from the i’s Arj Singh. Sunak sets up showdown with Tory right as Rwanda laws stop fail to ignore ECHR One source claims Robert Jenrick is “teetering” on the brink of resignation because legislation is not hard enough This is from the Spectator’s Isabel Hardman. And this is from Mail Online’s David Wilcock. Rishi Sunak told his MPs they had to “unite or die”, Kitty Donaldson from Bloomberg reports. Sunak tells his MPs “unite or die” Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, believes the Rwanda bill does not go far enough. A source close to her said: This bill doesn’t come close to meeting Suella’s tests. The prime minister has kept the ability for every single illegal migrant to make individual human rights claims against their removal and to then appeal those claims if they don’t succeed at first. It is fatally flawed. It will be bogged down in the courts for months and months. And it won’t stop the boats. It is a further betrayal of Tory voters and the decent patriotic majority who want to see this insanity brought to an end. Braverman set out her five tests in a personal statement in the Commons this afternoon. (Cabinet ministers can make a personal statement to MPs when they resign. Braverman was sacked, and it was more than three weeks ago, but she was allowed to make her statement anyway.) As the BBC reports, here are the five tests she set for a Rwanda bill. The BBC describes them as: 1) It must address the supreme court’s concerns about the safety of Rwanda 2) It must pave the way for flights to Rwanda before the next election “by blocking off all routes of challenge”, including under the Human Rights Act, the ECHR, the Refugee Convention, and all other international law 3) It must ensure removals to Rwanda can take place within days of people arriving illegally, rather than allowing challenges which drag on for months 4) It must allow people who arrive illegally to be detained until they are removed, and “Nightingale-style detention facilities” must be built to enable this, like Nightingale hospitals were built to deal with Covid 5) Parliament must be prepared to sit over Christmas to get this bill passed Boris Johnson was booed as he left the Covid inquiry a few minutes ago. Here is Rajeev Syal and Kiran Stacey’s story about the Rwanda bill. Rishi Sunak is about to address the backbench Conservative 1922 Committee. This is from the Sun on Sunday’s Kate Ferguson, who is with journalists in the corridor outside the room in the Commons where the meeting is taking place. Colin Yeo, a barrister specialising in immigration law, has posted a first-take analysis of the Rwanda bill in a series of posts on X. He says he thinks the bill does not breach international law, but that deportations under the bill could be unlawful under international law. Commenting on the Rwanda bill (see 4.41pm), Rishi Sunak said: I have been unequivocal that we can no longer tolerate the endless scourge of illegal migration on our country. It is costing us billions of pounds and costing innocent lives, and that is why we are taking action to put a stop to it and make clear once and for all that it is parliament that should decide who comes to this country, not criminal gangs. Through this new landmark emergency legislation, we will control our borders, deter people taking perilous journeys across the Channel and end the continuous legal challenges filling our courts. And we will disapply sections of the Human Rights Act from the key parts of the bill, specifically in the case of Rwanda, to ensure our plan cannot be stopped. The government has just published its bill intended to enable Rwanda deportation flights to take off. It’s called the safety of Rwanda (immigration and asylum) bill. Johnson defends Matt Hancock, the health secretary. He says he thought he was doing a good job. He was intellectually able and on top of his department. And he says he did not see why it would be good to replace him with someone who might not be better. He says control of the pandemic was centralised in No 10. Q: Mark Sedwill said in July you should sack him, you knew he had a tendency to over-promise, you knew people did not trust him, but you stuck with him? Johnson says it was not obvious that sacking him would help. And in politics someone is always urging you to sack someone, he says. Q: Dominic Cummings says you wanted to keep Hancock “as the sacrifice for the inquiry”. Johnson says he does not remember that at all. He goes on to say it’s “nonsense”. Hancock was a good communicator. Q: Sedwill said he told you to sack Hancock “to save lives and protect the NHS”. Johnson says he does not remember. And that’s it. Lady Hallett says Johnson has had a long day. And she says he will have a long day tomorrow, when he is back giving evidence for another whole day. Keith shows an exchange of messages between Mark Sedwill, the former cabinet secretary, and Simon Case, his successor. Johnson says he does not recall any conversations with Sedwill or Case about behaviour. He repeats his point about it not being a bad thing having people there who could “challenge the consensus and get things done”. Q: But lots of things were not done. Johnson says, when it came to the management of the pandemic, he does not think any feuding between officials made “the slightest difference” to processes or decision making. Q: The inquiry was shown a particularly offensive WhatsApp message about Helen MacNamara from Cummings to you and others. You never complained about that. Johnson says he does not remember that, but he must have seen it. He was on the group. He says he has called MacNamara to apologise for that. Keith says Johnson himself described the government as “an orgy of narcissism”. Johnson says that was at the end of the process. Q: A lot of evidence has been given to the effect that No 10 was dysfunctional. Johnson says no one put it to him like that. He says the country needed “continuous, urgent action”. He wanted meetings where people could speak their minds without fear. And he says he sometimes spoke bluntly in meetings “because I wanted to give people cover to do the same”. Lady Hallett intervenes. She says she wants to know if Johnson might have had a better framework for decision-making if a different culture had been in place. She says eventually they settled on the Covid-O and Covid-S committees (cabinet committees that managed Covid). Johnson says Hallett has “put your finger on it”. He says he wanted meetings where people said their piece. For future pandemics, there should be more clarity about the difference between decision-making meetings and discussion meetings. He says the PM should go into some meetings knowing that they are decision-making meetings. That was not happening, he says. Keith comes back to the departure of Mark Sedwill. He says it will be for Lady Hallett to decide whether he was sacked or whether, as Johnson claims (see 11.21am), he moved on. And he asks about the report that Helen MacNamara, the deputy cabinet secretary, compiled about the operation of No 10. Johnson says he would rather have a No 10 where people challenged, and brought new ideas, and felt free to say things, than one where people pretended all was well. Q: If you were concerned about civil service unease about Dominic Cummings, your response was to sideline Sedwill, and keep Cummings. Johnson says that is Keith’s way of putting it. Sedwill told him he wanted to move on, Johnson claims. As for the culture, “it was occasionally argumentative, but that was no bad thing”, he says. Q: For a long time you questioned if long Covid existed. And you compared it to Gulf War syndrome. Is that fair? Not really, says Johnson. But he says the words he scribbled in the margins of submissions about long Covid have been published. He accepts that they have caused offence, and he says: “I regret it very, very much.” He was trying to get to the truth of the matter. And it took him a long time to get a proper paper on it. Keith shows a note where Johnson described long Covid as “bollocks” and “Gulf war syndrome stuff”. And he says the evidence shows that Johnson continued to take this view. Even when he got a paper on it, Johnson said “it’s not exactly Gulf War syndrome”, Keith says. Johnson says many people with Gulf War syndrome had terrible symptoms. But some people thought they were suffering from something related to the Gulf War, which was not related to it. He says, with long Covid, he also wanted to find out what the Covid link was. Q: Did you know the mayor of London was repeatedly excluded from Cobra meetings? Johnson says Sadiq Khan, the mayor, was consulted a lot. There was talk of locking down London first. But that idea was dropped, he says. Q: The evidence from the metro mayors was that local leaders did not get enough information. That was a very significant failing, particular in regard to the tier system. Johnson says he is grateful to all the mayors for the work they did. Q: The inquiry has seen evidence that Manchester was punished for political reasons. Johnson says he does not remember that. In Liverpool there was a real effort to get mass testing going, he says. Johnson says, while taking account of the concerns of devolved administrations (DAs), he thinks the UK needs a better way of setting public health regulations for the UK in a pandemic. (During Covid England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all set their own regulations, which often differed.) Johnson says, with hindsight, he would have liked to have spend more time with the DAs. Q: But in your witness statement you said it was wrong for the PM of the UK to hold meetings with the first ministers. Johnson says he also thinks that. Q: They can’t both be true. Johnson says it can be worth doing things that are “constitutionally a bit weird” in the interests of fighting the pandemic. He says they need “a better way of getting a unified message for the United Kingdom”. Q: You said meeting with the DAs would look like a mini-EU. And you thought they leaked after Cobra meetings. And you accused them of taking decisions for political reasons. Johnson says he is not sure he said that to them. But he did think the coherence of the UK was being undermined. He says: Some form of integrated decision-making which does not leak is what you’re after. Comments have had to close for a bit, I’m afraid, because all our moderators have to attend a staff meeting. They should be open again around 3.30pm. I’m sorry about that. At the inquiry Hugo Keith KC is now asking about the end of the first lockdown. He says Rishi Sunak was concerned about over-compliance with the stay-at-home instruction. Q: In July 2021 did you say you had got the messaging wrong on this? Boris Johnson says, as they came out of lockdown, he felt strongly that it was important to allow people some freedom. He wanted to see people back at work, he says. But a lot of people were in a different place. They were still apprehensive. They did not want people lecturing them about what to do, he says. Keith shows extracts from Sir Patrick Vallance’s diary in which Vallance writes about Johnson wanting to “let it rip” in the summer of 2020. But he shows another message implying Johnson was concerned. Keith quotes the words at the top of this message as if they were from Johnson. Johnson said he thinks Keith has got this wrong. It was Matt Hancock talking about rising cases, he says. He says, like all good cabinet ministers, Hancock was lobbying for more money for his department. Before the break, Boris Johnson was asked if he should have waited to see if other measures were working before ordering the full lockdown on 23 March 2020. He said at that point it was “right to throw everything at it”. He went on: And we didn’t have any other shot, we didn’t have the systems to control the virus that perhaps I believed earlier in the month that we did. I didn’t know what other tools I had, as prime minister, to protect large numbers of people from this virus and I felt, fundamentally, that I was out of time. And what I believed in the previous week was that we still had some wiggle room because that seemed to be what I was hearing. I might have been wrong but I took the view on the Sunday and Monday that we were just out of time and the thing was too big and the curve was too aggressive. The inquiry is having a break until 3.10pm. Q: Do you think the full lockdown could have been avoided if the other measures introduced beforehand, like the instruction to people to stay at home, had started earlier? Johnson says he thinks that is unlikely. Keith shows a message from Johnson on 26 March 2020, the day he announced the full lockdown, in which he expressed doubt about the measure. Johnson says he thought that lockdown was necessary, and that it did work. But he says more work is needed to show exactly what impact it had. UPDATE: Johnson said: But I’ve got to tell you, in all honesty, I find it difficult to quantify the impact that those measures had, and the more we can do to explain why NPI [non-pharmaceutical intervention] measures of any kind why they’re necessary to the satisfaction of everybody, the easier it will be for government next time and the more public buy-in there will be. Lady Hallett intervenes. Q: When you decided to lock down, did you consider if there was a clear argument against lockdown? Johnson says he did. But he gave that argument “pretty short shift”. He says he thought the job of government was to protect life. If there had been no lockdown, what was happening in Italy would have happened here. He goes on: I had no other tool – literally nothing else. Many commentators have criticised the inquiry for assuming that the lockdown was a good thing, and for not considering the downsides. But Keith has regularly been asking government witnesses, as he has just been asking Johnson, why they did not delay lockdown so they could see if the voluntary “stay at home” order was working. Keith asks about Johnson’s meeting with Evgeny Lebedev, the Evening Standard owner, on 19 March 2020, in the week before the lockdown was formally announced. Why did it take place? Johnson claims he cannot remember, but he says he thinks it was about Covid. As owner of a London paper, Lebedev had to know what was happening, he says. Neither Keith nor Johnson name Lebedev. Keith does not press Johnson about this. It is widely assumed that this meeting took place to discuss Lebedev’s peerage, which at the time was being blocked by the House of Lords Appointments Commission. Johnson did not have face-to-face meetings with other newspaper owners at this point, and indeed people were being advised to avoid any unnecessary face-to-face meetings. UPDATE: Johnson said: I can’t remember what happened at that meeting, it was a very brief meeting. The newspaper proprietor in question doubtless wanted to know about what was happening to London … and indeed the whole country and wanted to be informed and I wanted to be supportive. Asked whether the meeting had been Covid-related, Johnson said: I can’t remember but I’m absolutely certain it must have been. The journalist Russell Scott says, when he submitted a Freedom of Information request, he was told that this was a personal\/social meeting. Q: To what extent did you appreciate by the night of Sunday 15 March that a lockdown was essential? It was not imposed until Monday 23 March. And it was going to be technically complicated. Was it a) you deciding a lockdown was essential, but it would take; or b) you starting planning for one, but delaying the final decision to later? Johnson says he was “increasingly reconciled” to the fact that he would have to do a huge amount more to suppress the virus. The complications were enormous, he says. His state of mind was – “I’m now more or less in virus-fighting mode”. Q: But you were not entirely like that? Here are messages showing that you were still opposed to lockdown. You would have been inhuman if you had not oscillated. But is it fair to say you made your oscillation clear to all around you. Johnson says it was his job to consider all the implications and to “test the policy”. These messages refer to a conversation with the chancellor where they considered the downsides. It would have been “negligent” not to consider those factors, he says. But this “did not in any way divert us from the crescendo of actions that we took”. Q: This is a poor example of executive function. You could not make up your own mind. Johnson objects. For the first time, almost, he seems to be getting angry. He had the chancellor with him, he says. He was told there was a risk to the UK bond markets. He had to go through the arguments. Q: You talked at this time about the danger of killing everyone to save “bedblockers”. Keith shows an extract from a note of a meeting. Johnson says this was an indication of the cruelty of the decision he had to take. If he said something like that, it was to illustrate the point. The comment was not designed to broadcast, he says. Q: Over the weekend of 14-15 March 2020 there was a change of strategy. Some people like Dominic Cummings were pushing for change. You know about the likely impact on the NHS. Why wasn’t the Department of Health and Social Care pushing for a different approach? It was still pushing for the “squashing the sombrero, herd immunity” strategy? Johnson says they knew at that point they had to act. They still thought they had “a bit of time”, and that was what the Sage paper from 12 March seemed to say. The shift on 13 March was about timing, he says. There was “a confluence of opinion”, he says. On Saturday 14 March he was talking to Prof Sir Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance. By 13 March Sage had realised something needed to be done, he says. Q: Until Cummings talked about plan B, no one at DHSC said a new approach was needed. Johnson says the Sage meeting was where the view changed. Q: Matt Hancock says he called you on Friday 13 March and said there should be an immediate lockdown. Do you recall that? Johnson says he does not. It has been a long time, he says. As the inquiry heard last week, there is no written evidence to support Hancock’s claim he made this call. Hancock did not even mention it in the book he wrote about the pandemic. Johnson says, with hindsight, he thinks the government should have stopped mass sporting events in early March. Q: But not doing so was in accordance with your own libertarian instincts? Johnson says at every stage he was thinking of the impact on people. What the government was going to do was “very destructive for a lot of people least able to bear the costs”. Keith shows a graph from a government paper from 12 March 2020. It shows that, even with measures in place, the NHS was going to be overwhelmed. (The black line shows the number of NHS beds. Even in the graph showing the peak of the virus suppressed, as a result of interventions, there are more hospital cases than beds.) Johnson says he was “bewildered” when he saw that chart. He says he “clocked” the danger. He goes on to say he thought “there must be a reason why we’re not being told to go urgently”. He goes on: I do remember looking at it and thinking there was something amiss. Keith shows an exchange of messages from Sunday 15 March 2020 in which Johnson says they have “no time” given what was happening in Italy. Johnson says on 12 March there was a press conference where he said a large number of people might die. It was “a pretty grim press conference”, he says. He says they were asked about the way through. Sir Patrick Vallance said that they wanted to flatten the curve, with some measure of herd immunity a good outcome by the autumn. He says Vallance said it might not be necessary or desirable to stop everyone getting the virus. Here is our live blog of that press conference. He says at this point people thought the government wanted to let the virus spread unchecked. That is not what the government wanted, he says. He says they had to do quite a lot of work to clear up that mess. He says they hoped herd immunity would be “a byproduct” of what they were doing. Keith shows a message from 5 March 2020 in which aides discuss telling Boris Johnson to stop saying it is “business as usual”. Johnson says he does not remember that. Keith asks if he understands that Sage was not able tell him what to do. Johnson accepts that. It is like a doctor-patient relationship, he says. If you do this, this will happen, he says. Q: You shook hands with patients at a hospital on 1 March. Was that because you had not been advised not to shake hands? Johnson claims he did not know about the advice, but he says in retrospect he should not have done that. But, he says, “I wanted to be encouraging to people.” The inquiry hearing is resuming. Hugo Keith KC, counsel for the inquiry, starts by showing a WhatsApp message that Dominic Cummings sent to Lee Cain on 3 March 2020. Boris Johnson says by this point he was rattled by what was happening in Italy. But he says the part of the message that is accurate is what it says about his fear about the impact of policies on the economy. Q: If you said “I don’t think anything can be done”, that is significant. Johnson says he cannot remember what he said to Cummings, and he says he “would not place too much reliance” on Cummings’ evidence. But he could not see what the plan was, he says. The NPIs (non-pharmaceutical interventions – lockdown-type measures, and other Covid rules) were “pretty far-fetched”, he says. And here is a summary of some of the key points from this morning by Ben Quinn and Matthew Weaver. Here is Peter Walker’s story about the evidence at the Covid inquiry this morning. Keith says Johnson chaired his first Cobra meeting on Covid on 2 March. He was told then that test and trace would not work. Q: Prof Sir Chris Whitty said at that meeting that interventions should not be imposed too early, to ensure maximum effectiveness. To what extent did this idea influence your decision making? Johnson says it was “the prevailing view for a long time”. It was not just Whitty. At a press conference on 12 March Sir Patrick Vallance also made the same argument, he says. Q: To what extent do you think you would have introduced measures earlier if you had not been told this. Johnson says this is “fundamental”. They did lock down. But it bounced back after they lifted restrictions, he says. Keith takes him back to the question. Q: Would you have gone earlier? How long a delay did this cause? Johnson says he does not think he would have gone earlier, because he would have been guided by the advice. To do this was not something to rush into. Q: Did you consider over-ruling the CMO, saying public health demands a lockdown, regardless of whether people will get tired of them. Johnson says: The short answer is no. Absolutely candidly, I don’t remember saying to myself: ‘This is so bad, they must be wrong, I must ignore the scientific advice and the threats to public health and have worse outcomes if we go too early’, and ‘I got to deal with the problem in front of the windscreen. I got to deal with it now’. I didn’t do that, perhaps with hindsight, I should have done but, as I said to you right at the outset of this hearing, I just don’t know the answer. And that is the end of the morning’s hearing. They are back at 1.40pm. Starmer asks Sunak about the Rwanda agreement, joking that the Conservatives would have been seen as making the “gimmick” a “resounding success” if its purpose was to “get people out of the country who simply couldn’t deal with … three home secretaries”. Sunak hits back, claiming Starmer “doesn’t understand” that deterrence is critical, in order to “break the cycle”. He says the government will do everything it takes to get the scheme working and stop the boats, and resorts to accusing Starmer of finding himself on the side of the people smugglers. Starmer again calls the scheme a “gimmick”, noting when the government first announced it, they vowed to settle thousands of people, which was reduced to hundreds. He asks how many refugees from Rwanda will be coming here to the UK under the treaty? Given no one from the UK has yet been sent … Sunak responds questioning if Labour has a plan to address the problem, and then quips that Starmer’s plan would be to “cook up a deal with the EU that would see 100,000 illegal migrants trebled on his watch”. Starmer asks how much the Rwanda deal has cost Britain in total given the scheme is capped at Rwanda’s capacity, and the east African country would be able to turn asylum seekers away if they wanted to. Sunak says he’s been “crystal clear” there is no incremental money but invites Starmer to support the plan. Starmer says the Rwanda scheme costs hundreds of millions of pounds with nothing in return. Referring to claims the home secretary, James Cleverly, called the plan “batshit”, Starmer said: “I am beginning to see why the home secretary said the Rwanda scheme was something to do with ‘bat’, I think, was it?” Sunak said there is a simple question: “If you believe in stopping the boats, as we on this side of the house do, you need to have an effective deterrent and returns agreement. It is as simple as that.” He went on to criticise Labour MPs who campaigned to block deportation flights of foreign criminals, citing that as a reason Starmer doesn’t back the Rwanda plan Meanwhile, the SNP Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn, asks Sunak if he’s worried that he’ll be the first Conservative party leader to lose a general election to a fellow Thatcherite, in reference to Starmer’s praise of the former Tory prime minister. He pits Labour and the Conservatives together based on their apparent stance on migration before asking why the prime minister thinks it’s acceptable to show “complete disregard” towards migrants. Sunak replied: “It is important that those who come here contribute to our public services.” Johnson says he recalls asking his advisers if the UK was facing a severe to mild flu, or pandemic, or something that would kill 500,000. Keith shows an extract from a note from Imran Shafi, Johnson’s private secretary, in which he records Johnson warning about the danger of an over-reaction. This was on 28 February 2020. Johnson says he was conscious of the potential costs. Q: So, instead of getting the government to respond, you warned about the possible over-reaction? Johnson says he was asking for a menu of options. Q: Do you accept the “level of seriousness” was not sufficiently communicated by you? Johnson says they had discussed borders, and he has been told there were ample supplies of PPE. They had also discussed NPIs (non-pharmaceutical interventions). But there was no concept of lockdown then. Q: There was not a proper debate about what to do. Johnson said people still did not think the RWCS was likely. Keith asks about Johnson being at Chevening at this period. Johnson says he does not accept claims he was doing nothing. He says he was working, including having calls with President Xi of China and President Trump. Q: No one is suggesting you were on holiday. Except you, says Johnson. Keith says he was referring to evidence given by Dominic Cummings. Johnson apologises for attributing that view to Keith. Johnson says the number of potential fatalities under the reasonable worst-case scenario (520,000) was horrific. He could not believe it. Q: Do you accept there was a lost opportunity in government to react in that two-week period? It took its eye off the ball. Johnson says there were things the government could and should have done if it had known how fast the virus was spreading. Keith shows minutes from a Cobra meeting on 26 February saying the RWCS was becoming the central planning assumption. Q: Were you told this? Johnson says he does not remember this. Rishi Sunak kicked off prime minister’s questions wishing the speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, a speedy recovery and offered condolences to the family and friends of Alistair Darling, Glenys Kinnock, and James Douglas-Hamilton, otherwise known as Lord Selkirk of Douglas, who “each made an enormous contribution to public life and will be deeply missed”. The prime minister went on to apologise for the suffering of the Hillsborough families and said the government wouldl ensure their pain was not repeated. Today ministers rejected the families’ call for a legally enforceable “duty of candour” but signed a charter to commit to transparency after public tragedies. Sunak said he hoped to meet the families in the new year. Tory MP for Lichfield, Michael Fabricant, used a closed question to praise Margaret Thatcher and warmly welcome Keir Starmer to the “Thatcher fanclub”. Sunak said he’s always delighted to welcome new Thatcherites from all sides of the house, but said it “says something” if the main “female and strong leader” Starmer could praise is Margaret Thatcher and not his own fantastic deputy, Angela Rayner. The Labour MP for Rotherham, Sarah Champion, asked the prime minister how he could justify taking food from the poorest children in her constituency as in March the government is set to end the household support scheme, which could end about 12,000 free school meals for the poorest children. Sunak said he was ensuring no child was growing up in poverty with the government’s cost of living support, and highlighted the government’s holiday activity and food programme, which only runs during the longest school holidays Keith shows Johnson an email from Shafi, written on 24 February 2020, saying he would soon like to expose Johnson to decisions he would have to take about Covid. Three days earlier 11 municipalities in Italy had locked down. Johnson says the scenes from Italy “really rattled me”. He remembers seeing a report saying they had an 8% fatality rate in Italy because they had an elderly population. He recalls thinking the UK had an elderly population too. He goes on: We should have twigged, we should collectively have twigged, much sooner. I should have twigged. Keith shows a message from Dominic Cummings on 6 February 2020 saying Covid was likely to spread around the world. Q: Why was your focus then on communications, not on preventing the spread? Johnson says it was because they assumed it would be like other viruses, like Sars. The scientific community within Whitehall at that stage was not telling us that this was something that was going to require urgent and immediate action. He says they could see the mathematical implications of the reasonable worst case scenario (RWCS). But they did not think it would happen. Q: But you were told Covid had a 2% fatality rate – much higher than those other viruses. Johnson accepts that. But he says that “fallacious, inductive logic” meant they did not take those warnings as seriously as they should have done. He says they thought the RWCS would not materialise, but in this pandemic the outcome was close to the RWCS. Q: Did you express scepticism about the possible number of deaths? Johnson says he cannot remember that. But he can remember the impact of BSE in the UK, and the huge number of animals that had to be killed. He wanted to probe the forecasts, he says. Q: Do you accept that being informed about the possible fatality numbers was a lost opportunity? Johnson says he would accept that his mindset, “like the mindset of the overwhelming majority of the ministers and officials in Whitehall, in [January to mid-February] was not as alarmed as we should have been”. Q: Dominic Cummings says you asked at one point if people would think you were mad for not closing the borders? Johnson says he may have said something like that. He thought the public would take that view. Q: And Cummings says you were opposed to border controls because you thought Covid would be just like swine flu. Johnson says he did want advice about borders. He suggests countries that imposed border controls did better. PMQs is about to start. My colleague Aletha Adu will be covering it, and posting about it here in the blog. I will keep going with the Covid hearing. Johnson says, again, that he and his colleagues did not comprehend at the start the risk. He suggests that, although figures were produced with potential death tolls, people did not fully believe them. He says: I don’t think we attached enough credence to those forecasts. He describes himself as “agnostic” at this point. He took what Matt Hancock was saying seriously, he says. But he was waiting for the advice to change. Keith says Johnson says in his witness statement they vastly underestimated the seriousness of Covid in January 2020. Keith asks Johnson why he was not warned at the end of January 2020 that there was a risk of a pandemic. Johnson says it was at the end of Feburary that the alarm was truly raised. The inquiry is back. Hugo Keith KC says he now wants to cover what happened in January and February 2020. Q: Matt Hancock says he remembers warning you about Covid in January. Do you remember those conversations? Boris Johnson says he doesn’t, but he says he spoke to Hancock a lot. He recalls not being sure whether Covid was “going to turn into a typhoon or not”. Q: There were five Cobra meetings on Covid. Did that not imply it was serious enough for you to get directly involved? Johnson says a Cobra is a regular occurrence in government. The possibility of a Covid pandemic was not something that had really “broken upon the political world” or entered his consciousness as a potential disaster. He was not asked about it at PMQs, he says. He says he asked Hancock to keep him posted. But, by the end of February, he was getting anxious. Q: Did you discuss whether you should have been chairing any of those Cobra meetings? Johnson says he recalls talking to his office about that. Q: That was on 24 February. Did you consider chairing Cobra yourself before that. By 16 January it was spreading outside of China. Why, as PM, were you not informed? Johnson says: “Here’s what I really think happened.” People could see what was happening to the data, he says. But they did not necessarily draw the right conclusions. That was “no fault of theirs”, he says. This was outside living memory. I don’t think people computed the implications of that data, and it was not escalated to me as an issue of national concern until much later. Q: You were PM. How could a government had failed to stop and think? Johnson says people did not remember anything like this. But people did remember Sars and Mers and swine flu, and these did not cause serious problems for the UK. Q: So it was a failed mindset? Johnson said it was a human, natural response, based on people’s experience. Before the break Hugo Keith KC showed extracts from Sir Patrick Vallance’s diary criticising the way decisions were taken at No 10. Asked if he thought the system whereby he was reliant on advice from special advisers needed to change, Johnson stressed that his key advisers on Covid were Prof Sir Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance. Q: Did you lose confidence in your cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill? Johnson said Sedwill decided to step aside. Q: Did you lose confidence in Dominic Cummings, your chief adviser? Johnson said he decided to stand aside too. The inquiry is now taking a short break. Keith shows the inquiry more WhatsApp exchanges about the culture at No 10, including this one, where Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, said he had “never seen a bunch of people less well equipped to run the country”. Q: Doesn’t this show friction in government was causing a problem? Johnson does not accept that. He claims that, if WhatsApp messages were available from the Thatcher government showing what its members thought of each other, some of them would have been “pretty fruity”. He says it would have been worse to have had a culture where people were “deferential” and “reluctant to make waves”. UPDATE: Johnson said: I think that the worst vice, in my view, would have been to have had an operation where everybody was so deferential and so reluctant to make waves that they never expressed their opinion, they never challenged and they never doubted. It was much more important to have a group of people who are willing to doubt themselves and to doubt each other. And I think that that was creatively useful rather than the reverse. Keith asks about a claim from Helen MacNamara, the deputy cabinet secretary, that talented people would not work at No 10 because of the culture there. Johnson claims he was not aware of that. Keith says there is evidence Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, told him directly that “top-drawer people” were refusing to work in Downing Street because of the atmosphere there. Johnson claims he cannot recall that. He says he ran a harmonious team when he was mayor of London. But he says at No 10 there should have been more women involved in some of the meetings. UPDATE: Johnson said: I think that the gender balance of my team should have been better … I think sometimes during the pandemic, too many meetings were too male-dominated if I’m absolutely honest with you. Keith says the inquiry is interested in the culture at No 10. It is not interested in the salaciousness of Dominic Cummings’ messages. But what he says about the culture at No 10 is relevant, he says. Q: That material paints “an appalling picture of incompetence and disarray”. Johnson says the inquiry has dredged up a phenomenal quantity of the type of material never available to a previous inquiry. That is a good thing, because you can get a feeling for the relationships and texture. Johnson says a lot of the language in those WhatsApp exchanges is unacceptable. He says he has apologised to one person over this. But there is a distinction between what is said, and what the government does. He suggests it is not unusual for people in government to not like each other, but for them to get a lot done anyway. He refers to the Blair government as an example. Q: There are extracts from Patrick Vallance’s diary that imply the opposite. Johnson says there were a lot of talented people trying to do their best. Under stress, they were inclined to be critical of others. Any other administration would have been similar, he suggests. Q: But do you accept that this related to the performance of government? Johnson does – but he says this was healthy. He goes on: We needed constantly to challenge ourselves and constantly to try to do better. He says, if the WhatsApp messages were all: “Aren’t we doing brilliantly?”, the criticism would have been even stronger. Q: You said in one message the government’s response had been “totally fucking hopeless”. Johnson says it was not his job to say everything was great. The government had notable achievements, he says. But it was his job to ensure some “challenging” characters kept going. UPDATE: Johnson said: I think that actually what you’re looking at, in all this stuff, is a lot of highly talented, highly motivated people who are stricken with anxiety about what is happening about the pandemic, who are doing their best and who, like all human beings, under great stress and great anxiety about themselves and their own performance, will be inclined to be critical of others … It would not have been right, if we’d had a load of WhatsApps saying, ‘aren’t we doing brilliantly folks, isn’t this going well’. I think your criticisms might have been frankly, even more pungent. Q: Were you aware that Matt Hancock, the health secretary, was sometimes excluded from meetings where health policy was discussed? Johnson says he does not accept that characterisation. A lot of things were very costly. He needed to have conversations with the Treasury, he says. Q: Who were you most reliant on for advice? Johnson says he does not want to embarrass officials by naming them. He says he had a superb deputy private secretary, and a brilliant private secretary for healthcare. Keith asks to what extent Johnson came to rely on his advice. Johnson says he relied on them, of course. But he goes on to say advisers advise, and ministers decide. Q: Did you read Sage (the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) minutes? Johnson says he may have looked at them “once or twice”. He says, in retrospect, it may have been “valuable to try to hear the Sage conversation”. He implies he relied on Prof Sir Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, who jointly chaired Sage. Q: Did you not consider reading the minutes direct? Why did you not call for the primary material, particularly in the debate on behavioural fatigue? Johnson says that it is a good question. But he was reliant on Whitty and Vallance, who are “outstanding experts in their field”. Keith asks about claims that cabinet was sidelined, and that it was not a place for serious discussions. Johnson says he does not accept that. But he claims cabinet as a whole was “more reluctant” to impose NPIs (non-pharmaceutical interventions – lockdown-type measures and other rules about conduct) than he was. Keith asks again if Johnson thinks that government decisions let to excess deaths being higher than they needed to be. Johnson says, again, he does not know. Johnson says there were some factors that made the UK particularly vulnerable to excess deaths. We have a an elderly population, extremely elderly population. We do suffer, sadly, from lots of Covid-related comorbidities and we are a very densely populated country, the second most densely populated country, in Europe, and that that did not help. Keith shows the inquiry an extract from Johnson’s witness statement. In it Johnson said: We – I – unquestionably made mistakes, and for those I unreservedly apologise. Keith asks what he is referring to. Johnson talks about mistakes with government communications. Keith suggests Johnson cannot think that was the main mistake, and he asks again what Johnson was thinking off. Johnson does not give a clear answer. He says he expects to cover what happened, issue by issue, as the hearing goes on. Q: Do you mean there were failings you got avoidably wrong? Or do you mean, with hindsight, you could have done better? That’s a deterministic question, Johnson says. Q: It’s an important one. Johnson says with hindsight he can see they should have done things differently. But at the time they felt they were doing their best. Q: Do you accept that overall the government decision making led materially to more excess deaths than might otherwise have been the case? Johnson says he cannot give an answer to that question. “I’m not sure.” But he says Keith presented a slide at an earlier hearing showing the UK second only to Italy in the league of excess deaths. That is not right, he says. The evidence is that the UK was “well down the European table” for excess deaths. Keith says he does not accept that. Johnson says he has seen data showing the UK 16th out of 33 countries for excess deaths. Keith says, among western European countries, the UK had one of the worst records for excess deaths. Q: Why was your old phone missing around 5,000 WhatsApp messages when handed over to the inquiry? Johnson says he cannot give a technical explanation, but he thinks it is something to do with it being reset. Q: A technical report says there may have been a factory reset of the phone. Johnson says he does not remember any such thing. Q: Did you make it clear you wanted those messages disclosed? Yes, says Johnson. He says, for the avoidance of doubt, he wants to say he has not removed any WhatsApp messages. Hugo Keith KC is questioning Johnson. He asks if Johnson’s approach has been to give all relevant material to the inquiry. Johnson says that has been his view. Keith shows WhatsApp exchanges, shown to the inquiry at a previous hearing, which implied that Johnson did not expect his messages to be disclosed. Johnson says he does not remember that. Boris Johnson starts saying he is “deeply sorry” about the pain and suffering experienced during Covid. He says: I understand the feelings of these victims and their families and I am deeply sorry for the pain and the loss and suffering of those victims and their families. He also expresses his thanks “to the hundreds of thousands of healthcare workers, and many other public servants, people in all walks of life” for what they did to protect people. As Boris Johnson starts, there seems to be some protest in the room. The cameras are not showing us what is happening, but Lady Hallett tells someone that unless they sit down, they will be asked to leave. She then says they will have to leave. Lady Hallett starts by expressing her “concern” about the reports in the papers about what Boris Johnson will say. She says what witnesses say in witness statements is supposed to be confidential until those statements are published. She goes on: I wish to remind all those involved in the inquiry process they must maintain this confidentiality so as to allow the sharing of materials prior to hearings between those most involved in the inquiry process. Failing to respect confidentiality undermines the inquiry’s ability to do its job fairly, effectively and independently. As we report this morning, there has been plenty of coverage in the papers about what Boris Johnson is likely to say to the Covid inquiry. In fact, there has been more advance leaking than you get with a budget. Some of this seems to be authorised, although probably not all of it. (If the editor wants a story on what Johnson is expected to say, a resourceful journalist will provide one, regardless of whether or not the Johnson camp are cooperating.) If Johnson is trying to influence Lady Hallett, the inquiry chair, he is bound to fail; you can’t spin a judge. But if his team has been engaged in a pre-briefing operation, as seems likely, their target will be public opinion, not the inquiry team. Here is a round-up of what the papers have been saying. On Saturday The pre-hearing coverage kicked off with this story in the Times, in which Steven Swinford, Chris Smyth and Oliver Wright said Johnson would admit to mistakes. They said: Boris Johnson will next week admit that he “unquestionably made mistakes” over Covid but insist that the decisions he took ultimately saved hundreds of thousands of lives. In his evidence to the Covid public inquiry the former prime minister is expected to issue an unreserved apology and say that he and his government were initially far too complacent and vastly underestimated the risks posed by the virus. He will argue that he had a “basic confidence that things would turn out alright” on the “fallacious logic” that previous health threats such as BSE and Sars had not proven as catastrophic as feared. However, he is expected to say that, overall, the government succeeded in its central aim of preventing the NHS from being overwhelmed by making the “right decisions at the right times”. On Sunday There was plenty more on Sunday, of which the best article was probably Tim Shipman’s in the Sunday Times. He said Johnson would argue that the first lockdown was delayed because scientists argued that “behavioural fatigue” would stop people complying with lockdown measures after a while, which meant they should not start too early. Shipman said: Johnson has spent, aides say, almost a year preparing for his appearance in front of Baroness Hallett and her panel. He will make the case that many of the explosive WhatsApp exchanges that have left his government looking like it was in the middle of a civil war were simply conversations around the issues, or “dark humour” — but that the key decisions were made in formal meetings based on this official advice. One minister from the Johnson government who has read his written evidence said: “I think he gives a good account of himself, actually.” In the Sun Sophia Sleigh also said Johnson would seek to deflect blame onto the scientists. She said: An ally of the ex-PM told The Sun on Sunday: “The only trolley involved were the trolleys full of vaccines Boris helped deliver for the UK. Boris only changed his views when the scientific advice changed. The experts kept changing their tune on issues.” And Glen Owen in the Mail on Sunday said Johnson wants more focus on whether the Covid virus was invented by the Chinese. On Monday On Monday Ben Riley-Smith in the Daily Telegraph said Johnson would deny Dominic Cummings’ claim that in February 2020 he was on holiday at Chevening trying to finish his book about Shakespeare instead of focusing on Covid. On Tuesday On Tuesday Steve Swinford and Chris Smyth in the Times said Johnson would suggest that Prof Sir Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, was responsible for the first lockdown being delayed. They said: Boris Johnson will claim that he delayed implementing the first lockdown on the advice of Sir Chris Whitty amid concerns that people would tire of the restrictions and flout the rules. The former prime minister’s statement to the Covid inquiry is expected to say that given the “massive disbenefits” of lockdown it was “obviously right” to ensure that it was not implemented too soon. He will highlight a series of warnings from Whitty, the chief medical officer, about the risks of locking down too early. In the Telegraph Ben Riley-Smith and Blathnaid Corless said much the same thing, although they also quoted a source saying Johnson would not be “blaming” the scientists. They said: Asked how the former prime minister would respond to [criticism about the timing of the first lockdown] an ally of Mr Johnson told The Telegraph that he would point to shifting scientific advice. The source said: “The scientific advice was right up until the last minute that lockdowns were the wrong policy and herd immunity was the right policy. People might get lockdown fatigue so you had to do it at the right time.” The source added: “We are not seeking to blame the scientists. They were doing a good job. It is more about getting an accurate recall on how little certainty there was around lockdown in February and March 2020. The scientists have to deal with the changing facts.” In a recent edition of his The Rest is Politics podcast, which he co-hosts with Rory Stewart, Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair’s former communications chief, recalled giving evidence to one of the Iraq inquiries. (I don’t think he was clear whether it was Hutton or Chilcot.) There were going to be protesters outside, and Campbell said he was offered the chance of going in by the back door. He refused, he said, and insisted on going in through the main entrance, ignoring the shouting. This is what he posted on X this morning about Johnson dodging the protests at the Covid inquiry this morning. What a coward. When the pandemic came he couldn’t be arsed to get from his bed in Chequers to Cobra meetings. But when there is a risk of being confronted by the consequences of his inactions he sneaks in as early as he can. Contemptible Asked about Boris Johnson arriving three hours early for the Covid inquiry this morning, Chris Philp, the policing minister, joked “it’s the first time Boris has ever been early for anything”. Outside the Covid inquiry representatives of families who lost loved ones during the pandemic are holding a mini press conference ahead of Boris Johnson’s evidence. Aamer Anwar, lead solicitor for the Scottish Covid Bereaved, was the first speaker. He said the evidence presented to the inquiry so far had presented “a deadly culture of impunity, of incompetence, of arrogance and blaming everyone else but themselves”. UPDATE: Anwar said: Boris Johnson is expected to issue an apology this morning. Yet he will claim he saved thousands of lives. For many of the bereaved that will be a grotesque distortion of the truth. In Boris Johnson’s words, instead of solving a national crisis, his government presided over a total disgusting orgy of narcissism. He did let the bodies pile up and the elderly were treated as toxic waste. As a result, over a quarter of a million people died from Covid. They cannot speak for themselves but their families, the bereaved and all those impacted by Covid deserve the truth today. Good morning. Boris Johnson has never been known for his punctuality. As a journalist he was famous for submitting his articles well beyond the deadline, and as PM he was not one of those ministers obsessed with starting and finishing meetings on time. But this morning he arrived three hours early at the Covid inquiry, where he is due to start a two-day evidence session at 10am. Perhaps he’s got some last-minute reading to do. The fact that he managed to get in before relatives of people who died in the pandemic, who have been outside protesting at some hearings, were present may just have been a fortuitous bonus. Henry Zeffman from the BBC has a picture. When he left office, Johnson’s supporters used to claim that, on Covid, he got “all the big calls right”. More recently some of the briefing by his allies has settled on the line that he got most of the big calls right. The next two days will help to determine how the inquiry – and history – assesses his performance as a pandemic PM, and the final judgment is likely to be a bit closer to the “he didn’t get everything wrong” category. As Peter Walker, Pippa Crerar and Ben Quinn report in their preview story, Johnson has been criticised for the extensive briefing about what he is going to say that has already appeared in the papers. I will be focusing mostly on the Covid inquiry today. But I will break away to cover PMQs at noon, and if there are any other big political stories, they will feature too. We are still waiting for the government to finalise and publish its legislation intended to enable Rwanda deportation flights to go ahead, and that is expected before the end of the week.

       "    'fields': {'headline': 'Robert Jenrick quits frontbench over Rwanda bill, piling pressure on Sunak',\n",
       "     'bodyText': 'Rishi Sunak’s government was plunged into further crisis when the immigration minister quit just hours after the prime minister tabled a bill to save his Rwanda deportation policy. Robert Jenrick stood down after it was revealed that the legislation did not allow the government to override the international laws that have stopped the government sending asylum seekers to central Africa. In a letter published on X, the MP for Newark said Sunak’s bill was “a triumph of hope over experience” and will mean that the policy will be challenged again in the courts. Jenrick’s resignation will be seen as a move to position himself as the head of the growing rightwing rebellion aimed at ensuring that the UK can act unilaterally and send flights to Kigali. It comes just weeks after the former home secretary Suella Braverman was sacked and accused Sunak of “wishful thinking” to “avoid having to make hard choices” on immigration. Jenrick, seen until recently as a close political ally of Sunak’s, wrote: “I am unable to take the currently proposed legislation through the Commons as I do not believe it provides us with the best possible chance of success. “A bill of the kind you are proposing is a triumph of hope over experience. The stakes for the country are too high for us not to pursue the stronger protections required to end the merry-go-round of legal challenges which risk paralysing the scheme and negating its intended deterrent,” he said. The emergency bill will give ministers the power to ignore some judgments that come from Strasbourg while stopping short of leaving or “disapplying” the European convention on human rights in its entirety. Critics from the Conservative right have said that such a move raises the possibility that individual legal challenges will still be able stop planes taking off for Rwanda. Sunak thanked Jenrick for his efforts, but said his resignation was “disappointing”, telling him in a letter he fears it was “based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the situation”. He said the bill was “the toughest piece of legislation ever put forward by a UK government” but ignoring the courts entirely would have meant Rwanda pulling out of the scheme. “There would be no point in passing a law that would leave us with nowhere to send people to.” Confirmation of Jenrick’s resignation came earlier on Wednesday night as Cleverly presented the bill to MPs alongside Sunak but without Jenrick. The shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said: “We’ve got a home secretary making the statement, but the rumours are that the immigration minister has resigned. Where is he? Perhaps he can make that the first question that he answers – whether he still has an immigration minister in place. “They’ve got open warfare among their backbenches, the starting gun fired on the next leadership election, and once again the whole country paying the price for this chaos.” Cleverly initially declined to answer several requests for an explanation, but was then informed that the home office minister, Laura Farris, had confirmed Jenrick’s resignation on LBC. The Rwanda (asylum and immigration) bill stopped short of leaving the convention and does not include “notwithstanding clauses” which would allow ministers to ignore the ECHR and other international treaties in the area of asylum. The legislation, which must be voted on by parliament, gives ministers the powers to disregard sections of the Human Rights Act. Cleverly has admitted that he cannot confirm that the legislation is compliant with Britain’s obligations under the ECHR. Last night, several Tory MPs indicated that they were deeply unhappy with the bill. A source close to Braverman said the bill was “fatally flawed”. “The prime minister has kept the ability for every single illegal migrant to make individual human rights claims against their removal and to then appeal those claims if they don’t succeed at first. It is fatally flawed. “It will be bogged down in the courts for months and months. And it won’t stop the boats. It is a further betrayal of Tory voters and the decent patriotic majority who want to see this insanity brought to an end,” the source said. Other rightwing Tory MPs were unhappy that the bill does not disapply the ECHR and believe that each asylum seeker could seek an injunction to stop being removed on a flight. “\\u2060I can’t see how we’ve prevented individual legal challenges,” said one MP. In the Commons, the former minister Sir John Hayes, an ally of Braverman’s, told the Commons: “The new home secretary will of course be aware and welcome the fact that he will be … judged by the effectiveness of this legislation for weeks and months and years, perhaps decades even.” Mark Francois, the former defence minister, said the home secretary had “pointedly ducked” questions about individual appeals. “As every person we would seek to send to Rwanda is an individual, if under this legislation those people could continue to appeal and appeal in order to delay being put on a flight, what’s the point of the bill?” Cleverly, in his reply, said: “An appeal process is an important part of a new legal process. It will not preclude people from being sent to Rwanda on this scheme.” The former home secretary Priti Patel asked for details of any assessments made “as to whether the disapplication of the Human Rights Act and other laws are robust and will stand up to the legal challenges”. Braverman, the previous home secretary, had earlier made a personal statement to MPs saying that the Tories faced “electoral oblivion” unless ministers blocked all domestic and international laws used to halt deportation flights. Sunak, after the bill had been published but before Jenrick’s resignation had been confirmed, met members of the 1922 Committee and told MPs that they must “unite or die” over the bill. He also claimed that the UK government could not go further and disapply the ECHR because the Rwandan government had insisted that it must stay within international laws, sources said. In a statement issued by the Rwandan government, Vincent Biruta, the minister of foreign affairs, said Kigali would have walked away from the deal if it had meant breaking the law. “Without lawful behaviour by the UK, Rwanda would not be able to continue with the Migration and Economic Development Partnership,” he said. No 10 had been considering two options in the bill. The first, the so-called “semi-skimmed” option, aimed to disapply only the UK’s Human Rights Act in asylum claims. However, this would not prevent challenges by individual migrants, sources said. The second, “full-fat” option removed the right of judicial review and included “notwithstanding clauses”, which would allow ministers to ignore the ECHR and other international treaties in the area of asylum. It was the second part of a strategy by the government to get its Rwanda policy back on track following last month’s supreme court judgment that ruled the policy unlawful. The treaty, signed by Cleverly in Kigali on Tuesday, guarantees that migrants relocated from the UK to Rwanda will not be sent back to their home country. In a statement, Sunak said: “Through this new landmark emergency legislation, we will control our borders, deter people taking perilous journeys across the Channel, and end the continuous legal challenges filling our courts. “And we will disapply sections of the Human Rights Act from the key parts of the bill, specifically in the case of Rwanda, to ensure our plan cannot be stopped.” The bill will be introduced to the Commons on Thursday, and a substantive debate will happen next week. Pat McFadden, Labour’s national campaign coordinator, responding to Jenrick’s resignation, said: “This latest chaotic chapter demonstrates why the country is ready for change. And Keir Starmer’s changed Labour party stands ready. “The British people deserve a government that will fix the issues that matter to working people, not a Tory circus of gimmicks and leadership posturing.”'},\n",

       "     'bodyText': 'Robert Jenrick was appointed immigration minister just over 12 months ago by his close political ally Rishi Sunak. At the time, the assumption was that he had been put there as a Downing Street stooge to keep a close eye on his boss, Suella Braverman. The then home secretary’s inflammatory rhetoric on immigration, including describing asylum seekers entering the UK as “an invasion”, was attracting criticism. She was, the prime minister’s supporters believed, on manoeuvres for the top job in the event of the Tories losing the next election. Now, it seems, Jenrick has gone native. He quit just hours after Sunak published his new Rwanda legislation, saying that it was not tough enough and that he could not stay in post when he had “such strong disagreements” with the direction of government policy. There have been signs. In July, he ordered the removal of murals of cartoon characters – including Mickey Mouse – painted on the walls of an asylum seeker reception centre to cheer up children because he thought they were too welcoming and sent out the wrong message. More recently, he has argued for the need to reduce net migration to the UK, going further than No 10 in suggesting ways it could be brought down and hinting at his frustration at Sunak’s inaction over record high numbers. His allies have suggested he presented a five-point plan to No 10 on how to reduce them. Jenrick “rose without a trace” before becoming a cabinet minister at the age of 37, in the words of one Conservative Home columnist. He won his Newark seat in a 2014 byelection after his predecessor, Patrick Mercer, resigned in a lobbying scandal. For years, he was an unmemorable MP, lacking any distinctive policies or causes. Yet as communities secretary, he caught the headlines in 2020 after overruling a planning decision in a way that benefited the Tory donor and former newspaper magnate Richard Desmond. He pushed through the decision to approve a £1bn development of flats a day before a community levy would have come into force, providing £45m for Tower Hamlets council to spend on local infrastructure. The council challenged the decision in court and Jenrick backed down, conceding a potential for bias. It later emerged that he had sat next to Desmond at a Tory party fundraising event in November 2019, although he said he refused to discuss the application. Two weeks after the planning decision, Desmond gave the Conservatives £12,000. Amid increasing political pressure, Jenrick’s department released correspondence relating to the case showing that Desmond had texted him about the issue, and which suggested that Jenrick had urged officials to complete the process before the levy came into force. He was sacked by Boris Johnson in the next reshuffle. Jenrick, a wealthy former solicitor who owns two London properties and a Grade I-listed manor house in Herefordshire, also ran into trouble at the peak of the coronavirus lockdown after it emerged that he had visited another property, his parents’ home in Shropshire. While he conceded that he had done this, he said it had been to drop off food and medicines and that he had not entered their house. Jenrick, 41, will now return to the backbenches, where he will sit alongside Braverman, presumably trying to make waves as another standard-bearer for the right on the claimed need to reduce net migration, even if it means ripping up international agreements. Yet friends say he also has one eye on the future. “Rob is distancing himself from Rishi, it’s as simple as that. He’s young and is in this for the long term, and can see which way it’s going,” one senior minister told the Guardian last week. “He may have nailed his colours to Rishi’s mast initially, but if there’s going to be a new captain of the ship after the election, he doesn’t want to be too closely associated with the one that walked the plank.” In his resignation letter to the prime minister, Jenrick wrote that the pair “have been friends for a long time”. When even such friendship cannot command loyalty, things are looking grim for Sunak.'},\n",

       "     'bodyText': 'OK. Let’s take it easy for a bit. Stop caring so much. Just take some deep breaths. Realign the whatevers. Let the anger subside. Because being furious is the response that Rishi Sunak wants. The endgame of this government is a permanent culture war. Tilting at windmills. A descent into ever more binary politics. Where reason gives way to hate. Hating is so much easier. So much more fun. This is the only way to cope with Sunak and his team these days. Stop trying to think of them as sentient beings. With a higher rational purpose. They now exist only to exist. That is their teleology. They have no interest in the UK or its people. In making things better. Their only goal is survival. To chase the soundbite of the day. No matter how idiotic and unworkable. To imagine there is a plan is a basic category error. Rather, we’re just being gaslit on a daily basis. Trolled to believe that the truth is whatever the government wants it to be that day. Take James Cleverly. Again. Shit seems to follow the home secretary around wherever he goes. Though that sort of goes with the territory. You don’t need me to tell you that he’s not the brightest of ministers, but he’s still considerably more able than most of his colleagues. You will struggle to find any sign of synaptic activity elsewhere in cabinet. So Jimmy Dimly wins by virtue of the occasional misfire. Not that it does him much good, as the prime minister merely sends him off to do all the things he can’t be bothered to do himself. As foreign secretary, this wasn’t too much of a problem as Jimmy D merely flew around the world at the UK taxpayers’ expense to shake hands with people. Nothing he did or said was of any great importance as no one in the rest of the world takes much notice of what this country thinks about international relations. But promotion to a higher level of incompetence has its drawbacks. And as home secretary he now has to get his hands dirty in things he would otherwise gone to have great lengths to avoid. Like the Rwanda scheme. When he was foreign secretary, Dimly was all too happy to call it out for what it was. Complete batshit, he called it. A distraction designed merely to placate the lunatic fringes of the Conservative party. One that was never meant to be taken as a serious policy option. And for once in his life, he was absolutely right. Imagine that. The irony. The pathos. How often is Jimmy D ever right? About once every two years? Maybe less frequently, even. And now he can’t even get to bask in the unexpected moment when the stars align. Because it was his bad karma to have been on a flight to Kigali to sign a fantasy treaty that was never going to be implemented. A waste of everyone’s time and energy. Delusional politics for a delusional government that would only be taken seriously by the deluded. And poor old Dimly was expected to act as if he was serious. So at lunchtime on Tuesday, Dimly scrawled a signature alongside that of Rwanda’s foreign minister, Vincent Biruta. The treaty itself was a shabby affair. Something hastily knocked up on the back of an envelope. The sentence that read “Rwanda is not really a safe country” had been changed to “Rwanda is a really safe country. Promise. Any problems, just ignore the ECHR.” That should easily take care of any objections from the supreme court. Then came the joint press conference. Jimmy D took to the stage. He just wanted refugees to be happy in Rwanda. To feel as if they were on holiday. Not that he would ever dream of taking a holiday in Rwanda himself. But if he did, he was sure he would have a good time. And no extra money had been offered to Rwanda to get them to sign the treaty. The very idea. Rwanda were just in it for the lols. They wanted to teach the world to sing. Anyone who said more money had changed hands would be shot. Talking of which. People were so quick to rush to judgment on Rwanda. The country was doing its absolute best not to shoot refugees, but if a few stragglers were killed then we shouldn’t make too much of it. The Rwandans were only trying to do their best. “This is not a treaty that has been signed because we are a government in search of easy answers or quick publicity,” Jimmy D said. Breathtaking. It’s literally the only reason they are doing it. And he knows that. His apparent lie was a subconscious plea to tell the truth. A desire for redemption. Forgiveness. He also couldn’t promise when any refugees would be deported. Because it’s just not going to happen any time soon. Dimly is the third home secretary to visit Kigali. Three more than the number of refugees deported. Just another tale told by an idiot. Back home, it had been left to “Honest Bob” Jenrick to hold the fort. And the baby-faced immigration minister wasted no time in ramping up the rhetoric on legal migration as he toured the TV and radio studios on the morning media round. Honest Bob has never yet met an immigrant he didn’t want to deport – he’d wave off his own parents if he had the chance – and he feels that now is his time. The stars at last have aligned. Was he bothered that reducing migration by 300,000 – still well above the Tory manifesto promise – would deplete the NHS and social care sectors? Not at all. People should be glad to die. Far better that than being cared for by foreigners. In any case, why couldn’t disabled people work harder? They were all far too lazy. And if 75% of Brits could no longer live with foreigners then that was all to the good. Bizarrely, all of this was too much even for some members of the rightwing media. Sure, immigration needed to come down. But they had always assumed that the immigrants we were talking about were those with brown skin. It had never occurred to them that people they knew might be adversely affected. Honest Bob was having none of this. A foreigner was a foreigner. You couldn’t trust any of them. Enough was enough.

       "     'bodyText': 'British taxpayers will bear extra costs after the signing of a treaty with the Rwandan government, James Cleverly, the home secretary, has said, as he asserted that the government was not pursuing “cheap and quick popularity”. The UK has suffered a sharp decline in its performance in international academic tests, wiping out recent progress, as the widespread disruption caused by Covid continued to take its toll on education, according to an OECD report. The UK has a relatively high rate of teenagers missing at least one meal per week because of poverty, the OEC report says. (See 4.13pm.) Thousands of junior doctors are to stage new strike action in England after failing to reach a deal with the government in talks over pay. Chris Huhne, the former energy and climate change secretary, has received a substantial six-figure sum from News UK. He is one of several figures who have received payments from the Murdoch-owned company as it settled historic phone-hacking cases. The UK government is likely to miss its targets under the Paris climate agreement by a wide margin, analysis shows, dealing a devastating blow to Britain’s standing on the international stage. The University and College Union says the government’s plans to toughen immigration qualifications by raising minimum salary requirements are a “massive own goal” that will hurt the higher education sector. Jo Grady, the UCU’s general secretary, said: By raising the [pay] threshold, ministers are sacrificing the ability of UK universities to attract talent, particularly among the early-career researchers who will become the pioneers of the future. At their current salary levels, many postdoctoral positions will now be closed off to international talent. We are already hearing reports of people in established careers whose visas are coming up for renewal being told that, under these new rules, they won’t be able to stay in their jobs. Worse still, the near doubling of the threshold for family visas is a callous move that threatens to tear families apart. It will have a disruptive effect on universities, but even more importantly it is just wrong that people’s lives can be turned upside down because ministers feel they have to appease their backbenchers. This chart, from the OECD’s Pisa report, illustrates the link between pupils’ performance at maths and the likelihood that they might be missing meals due to poverty. (See 4.13pm.) The UK’s performance is marked by the blob numbered 18. Maths performance is above the OECD average, but on the number of pupils missing at least one meal a week it scores higher than average (ie worse). The results of the latest round of the Programme for International Student Assessment – or Pisa – have been published today, showing UK scores have fallen sharply as a result of the disruption caused by Covid, yet the UK has still managed to inch up the global rankings because so many countries fared even worse. One high score which is less welcome however is the proportion of UK teenagers who are skipping a meal at least once a week because there is not enough money to buy food. One in 10 UK 15-year-olds (11%) told the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which conducts the survey, they had missed meals because of poverty, which puts the UK on a par with countries such as Mexico and Moldova. In contrast, some of the wealthier OECD and European countries did not want to even respond to the question about food insecurity, because they felt it was not an issue in their country. The OECD’s Alfonso Echazarra told a London briefing that one in 10 is “actually a relatively large proportion for an OECD country, and I think it is something to think about”. In contrast, Portugal, Finland and the Netherlands had the lowest rate of teenagers skipping meals because of poverty among those countries that participated. On pupil wellbeing, the Pisa survey also found that more than a quarter (28%) of UK teenagers reported being bullied a few times a month, compared with the OECD average of a fifth, and almost two-thirds (64%) said they felt they “belonged” at school, which falls short of the OECD average of 75%. Angela Smith, the Labour leader in the Lords, asks if Cameron will agree a UK-EU security pact. She says that he proposed that when he was PM. Cameron says he expected to be asked to eat his words on occasion. But he says the Ukraine war has shown how UK-EU security cooperation is working well, without a specific pact. The Foreign Office questions are now over. Michael Dobbs (Con) asked about relations with Greece. He says he is a supporter of the Parthenon Project, and asks Cameron if he favours the marbles returning to Greece. Cameron says he does not agree with Dobbs about that. Cameron says there is nothing more destructive to a country’s immigration system than having continual and very visible examples of the rules being ignored. He supports EU efforts to tackle illegal immigration, he says. Cameron is now dealing with the fourth question, about the EU. Kate Hoey, the former Labour MP, criticises the Windsor framework. Cameron says he was not involved in negotiating the Windsor framework, but he thinks it is a superb agreement. He says he understands Hoey’s concerns about it. He knows the Northern Ireland secretary, Chris Heaton-Harris, is trying to get the institutions of Northern Ireland up and running. Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, a former Foreign Office permanent secretary, says Russia and Belarus are the only countries in Europe that have left the European convention on human rights. Does Cameron agree with Suella Braverman that the UK should join them? Cameron says, from 2005 onwards, he has been making speeches about the need to put the national interest first. He says that is consistent with staying in the European convention on human rights. He says when he was PM he had a dispute with the European court of human rights on prisoner voting. The court backed down, he claims. And he says in future that some flexibility may be needed again. UPDATE: Cameron said: I can go back as far as 2005 and point to speeches that I made that said we always have to put our national interest first, whether that is the need to deport dangerous terrorists, whether it is the need to have an immigration policy that works for our country. I believe that is consistent with remaining in the ECHR. But, as I found as prime minister, there are occasions when the ECHR makes judgments, as they did on the issue of prisoner votes, when they said it was absolutely essential that we legislated instantly to give prisoners the vote, and I said I didn’t think that was the case, I think that should be settled by the Houses of Parliament – and the ECHR backed down. So that sort of flexibility may well be necessary in the future. Back in the Lords Angela Smith, the Labour leader in the Lords, asks if Cameron is confident that sanctions are properly enforced. Cameron says he has not specifically asked about this, but he says he will consult his office on this. Overriding the European convention on human rights (ECHR) in an effort to realise the government’s Rwanda deportation policy is a “red line” for moderate Conservative MPs, a grouping representing them has said. The One Nation Caucus, which represents 106 Tory MPs, said it would be closely examining the details of legislation being brought forward by the government very carefully to see if it maintained the UK’s commitment to the rule of law. Matt Warman, a senior member of the caucus, said: Overriding the ECHR is a red line for a number of Conservatives. Protecting and reforming institutions and upholding human rights should be the cornerstone of any Conservative government. Another MP, the former first secretary of state Damian Green, said the government should think twice before overriding both the ECHR and Human Rights Act. Cameron is now dealing with the second question, from Labour’s George Foulkes, about Belarus. Foulkes says 1,500 people have been imprisoned by the Belarusian regime for their political stance. He says the UK should be imposing more sanctions on Belarus. Cameron says 182 individuals and entities have already been sanctioned. That list is kept under review. This is Europe’s totalitarian regime, he says. He thanks Foulkes for his campaigning on this and says he agrees with the aim of the question. Asked about claims that Turkish ports are being used to supply arms to Russia, Cameron says it is important to see where dual-use goods are being supplied to Russia. There are concerns about Turkey, he says. He says he raised that with the Turks. But there are concerns about other countries too. Asked how much the UK will spend on arms for Ukraine in 2024, Cameron says he does not have that figure to hand. But he says support will contain at the scale it has been before, or beyond that. He says the UK will focus on what it is Ukraine needs. In the Lords David Cameron is now taking question. George Robertson, the former Labour defence secretary and former Nato secretary general, asks about support for Ukraine. Cameron says the UK has provided humanitarian and economic support worth more than £4.7bn to Ukraine, and that it will continue to provide support. Robertson asks why there was no mention of extra military aid in the autumn statement. He says the money offered for 2023 is about to run out. Cameron says the UK has given military support worth £4.6bn to Ukraine. This is essential, he says, and it will continue. Patrick Cormack (Con) asks if Cameron can do anything to speed up the supply of arms. Cameron says there should be more focus on the success that Ukraine is having. On land the picture has been difficult, but in the Black Sea the Ukrainians have pushed the Russians right back. And he claims the Ukranians destroyed around one fifth of Russian helicopters in one night recently. A reader asks: Are those new immigration rules something the govt can just unilaterally decree? Or does this have to go to a vote? In practice, they will just happen. To implement the changes, the government does need to do it through secondary legislation – which involves changing regulations. Secondary legislation is subject to approval by parliament. There are two mechanisms (or at least two mechanisms – in practice it is more complicated). Regulations subject to the affirmative procedure have to be approved and voted on, but regulations subject to the negative procedure go through unless voted down – and this more or less never happens, mainly because the government gets to decide whether or not there should be a vote. Immigration rules are changed via the negative procedure, the Home Office says, and that means there is no realistic chance of a vote. David Cameron is about to take questions in the House of Lords for the first time in his capacity as foreign secretary. The session will last for about 40 minutes and four peers are down to ask the main questions, covering Ukraine, Belarus, Afghanistan and the EU. Other peers will be allowed to ask supplementary questions, but they should be broadly related to the main ones. The Lords order paper, with the wording of the questions, is here. At his press conference in Kigali James Cleverly, the home secretary, said the government was not trying to send asylum seekers to Rwanda as a means of gaining “cheap or quick popularity”. (See 1.49pm.) He said: The UK and Rwanda are working on this because it is important, not because it is necessarily easy or that it buys you cheap or quick popularity. But one of the claims about the policy is that it was originally announced precisely for that purpose. This is what Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson’s former chief adviser, posted on X two days ago. He’s right. the whole point of Rwanda was an *alternative* to facing the reality of the problems. but because Tory-SW1 world is so insane, Boris’s trick to divert them has actually worked far better than he planned &amp; has taken on a life of its own, with even the new PM treating it as if it were an actual plan. and even more weirdly, establishment NPCs like Will Tanner convinced themselves doubling down on it was a ‘win-win’ politically. and Sunak bought it because like other Tory MPs he wanted to believe in a *fake* rather than face the actual problems - which No10 has actively avoided facing since people told them in Jan ‘rwanda cannot work, here are all the legal &amp; practical reasons why’. and now Tanner is reduced to telling people in No10 ‘all the polls are wrong like in 2016’ so many layers of how people in politics run *denial-of-service attacks on their own perception of reality*... Tanner is Will Tanner, Rishi Sunak’s deputy chief of staff. Cummings was commenting on a tweet from a former No 10 adviser who claimed the Rwanda agreement was never intended to be a serious solution to the small boats problem. The Rwanda policy was announced in April 2022, when Boris Johnson administration was floundering, partly because of the Partygate scandal. If it was intended to provide a popularity boost, it did not work. Public reaction was initially relatively, but not universally, favourable. But, over the last 18 months, as the government has repeatedly failed to implement the policy, it has reinforced perceptions that the government is incompetent. The Home Office has sent out a news release about the UK-Rwanda treaty. It is due to publish the text of the treaty too, although it does not seem to be online yet. The treaty was signed in response to the supreme court saying the deportation policy was unlawful because there was a risk of asylum seekers sent to Rwanda being returned to the country from which they were fleeing (“refoulement”, to use the migration law term – a practice banned under various conventions protecting refugees). The treaty addresses the concerns of the supreme court in two ways. First, as a treaty and not just an agreement between two governments (the previous one was described as a “memorandum of understanding”), it has greater legal clout. It is legally binding (meaning Rwanda is under more pressure to comply). And, second, some of the safeguards in the original agreement have been beefed up, in response to concerns that the supreme court had about the Rwandan asylum system not containing enough measures to protect claimants. Describing the treaty, the Home Office says: The landmark treaty is binding in international law and ensures that people relocated to Rwanda under the partnership are not at risk of being returned to a country where their life or freedom would be threatened – an act known as refoulement. It also enhances the functions of the independent monitoring committee to ensure compliance with the obligations in the treaty, such as reception conditions, processing of asylum claims, and treatment and support for individuals including up to five years after they have received final determination of their status. The committee is made up of eight independent members. The monitoring committee will also develop a system which will enable relocated individuals and legal representatives to lodge confidential complaints directly to them. It will have the power to set its own priority areas for monitoring, and have unfettered access for the purposes of completing assessments and reports. It may publish reports as it sees fit on its findings. To further bolster assurances that relocated individuals will not be returned, under the treaty, Rwanda’s asylum system will be strengthened through a new appeal body. The appeal body will consist of a Rwandan and other Commonwealth national co-president, and be composed of judges from a mixture of nationalities with asylum and humanitarian protection expertise (appointed by the co-presidents) to hear individual appeals. Q: Rwanda has been traduced by the supreme court in the UK. So why is Rwanda continuing with this agreement? Why is Rwanda “bending over backwards over this”? Biruta says the government is continuing with this because it thinks it is doing the right thing in terms of dealing with a global crisis. There are situations around the world that will continue to produce refugees. It is not helpful to criticise a country like Rwanda that is offering solutions, he says. We were “unfairly treated” by international organisations, by the media, by courts, but we think we are doing the right thing, he says. And he suggests Rwanda’s critics have not always offered solution. The government can survive criticisms from these actors, he says. Cleverly says he has “a huge amount of admiration” for the Rwandan government. It has been getting criticism out of proportion to the effort it has been making. The Rwandan government is trying to continue its processes, as all governments should do this. He says the UK and Rwandan government are doing this because it is important, not for quick popularity. UPDATE: Cleverly said: The UK and Rwanda are working on this because it is important, not because it is necessarily easy or that it buys you cheap or quick popularity. We do this despite the fact that it is difficult and sensitive, because if we don’t address these issues, the people that will ultimately be the winners are the people smugglers, they are the slave traders, they are the criminal gangs … Rwanda is stepping forward to be a thoughtful and careful partner in solving these incredibly difficult international issues. I think that they deserve support in doing that and I have been uncomfortable with the tone and the volume of some of the criticism directed at Rwanda for having the courage to step forward and to try and be part of the solution, rather than part of the problem. Q: Will Rwanda remain committed to this even if there are further delays? Biruta says Rwanda is committed to this partnership. Q: How much extra money has the UK paid Rwanda? Cleverly says the Rwanda government has not asked for, and the UK has not provided, any funding related to the treaty. But the deal reflects costs that may be imposed on Rwanda as a result of the partnership. Dealing with migration is important, and is not cost-free. But it is the right thing to do, he says. Rwanda is helping the UK in its fight against illegal migration, he says. They are doing so “professionally, thoughtfully” and as a partner working on a global challenge. Q: Were you offended by the supreme court ruling? Biruta says before the judgement Rwanda had been accepted as a legitimate partner. He implies the ruling was a surprise. But he says that in life there is always room for improvement. Cleverly and Biruta are now taking questions. Chris Mason, the BBC’s political editor, goes first. Q: You are not the first home secretary to come here. What makes you think this time will be different? And are you confident flights will happen? Cleverly says the UK has been working with Rwanda on a range of issues, including the migration partnership. The Rwandan government has shown an “energy and a professionalism”, and a desire to work with the UK, he says. He says he wants this part of the migration plan up and running as soon as possible. The treaty addresses all the points raised by the supreme court, he says. The UNHCR regards Rwanda as a credible, long-term partner, he says. And he says the terms of the treaty will be reflected in domestic legislation soon. Cleverly starts by saying that he knows Biruta from his old job as foreign secretary. He says he has found Biruta, and the Rwandan government in general, as “professional, thoughtful and serious partners on the world stage”. Cleverly says Rwanda has shown itself to be a country that is serious about dealing with asylum seekers. He says the economic development partnership part of the deal is important. The UK wants to address the factors that led people to travel abroad, he says. Rwanda has made a “strong commitment” to the safety of asylum seekers, he says. This is an important point because the supreme court ruled the deportation policy illegal on the grounds that Rwanda was not safe. In Kigali James Cleverly, the home secretary, has just signed the new treaty with Rwanda. The foreign affairs minister Vincent Biruta signed on behalf of the Rwandan government. The two ministers are now holding a press conference. Junior doctors in England are to stage more strikes after talks between the government and British Medical Association broke down, the union has said. If the immigration plan announced yesterday was a budget, the bit most in danger of “unravelling” would be the huge increase in the minimum salary threshold for family visas. The Daily Telegraph is normally an enthusiastic supporter of immigration crackdown, but last night there was a lot of interest on X in these tweets from Tim Stanley, a writer on the paper, complaining about the policy. It is telling that this is the one element in the package about which Labour is most critical. This morning Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said this morning that this plan could have an impact “on British citizens who fall in love across borders” and she said the new £38,700 threshold should be reviewed by the Migration Advisory Committee. (See 11.21am.) At the lobby briefing this morning the PM’s spokesperson implied that the new rule was not as restrictive as some people implied. He said that the £38,700 threshold applied to the household as a whole, and not just the individual bringing a dependant to the UK, and he said people would not necessarily need to earn this amount every year. He explained: They can also demonstrate this through their level of savings. If you don’t meet the minimum income requirement, you may also be able to bring a dependant to the UK if you get certain benefits, for example disability living allowance. The spokesperson also said that in exceptional circumstances the threshold could be disapplied. The family immigration rules contain a provision for exceptional circumstances where there would be unjustifiably harsh consequences for the applicant, their partner, a relevant child or another family member if their application were to be refused. And he also said that some people affected by the new rule might be able to apply for another sort of visa, such as a student or a skilled worker one. At the morning lobby briefing No 10 also rejected suggestions from the care home sector that preventing people with care visas from bringing dependants to the UK would stop people applying. The PM’s spokesperson said: Through work with the Home Office and the Department of Health, we believe that there will still remain high demand for these roles even with these changes, which are necessary. Downing Street said this morning that it was not considering introducing an annual cap on immigration numbers “at this point”. Asked about Robert Jenrick’s comment this morning saying there were “merits” in the idea (see 9.41am), the PM’s spokesperson said: I think we’ve set out the toughest approach to tackling legal migration and bringing the numbers down. What we said is that we are not prevented from going further should we wish to do and I think that’s what the immigration minister was emphasising this morning. At the moment our belief is that having full control of our immigration system ensures we’re able to prioritise the skills and talent that are needed to grow the economy, support the health and care sector. We think the approach we set out yesterday achieves that and we aren’t considering a cap at this point. James Cleverly, the home secretary, is due to take part in a signing ceremony in Kigali shortly to agree the new deportation treaty with Rwanda. He took part in this morning’s cabinet meeting virtually, and told colleagues “the treaty was the culmination of months of work”, No 10 said at the morning lobby briefing. Cleverly also said the treaty meant “we now have the strongest possible agreement with Rwanda and one which goes far beyond that of the UNHCR’s with Rwanda”, No 10 said. Nigel Farage, the former Ukip and Brexit party leader, is viewed by ITV bosses as one of the most boring participants they have had on I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here, the Daily Mirror claims in its splash. Presumably this won’t bother the Conservative MP Jonathan Gullis. Last night he told GB News that he would like to see Farage in the House of Lords as a Tory peer and serving in government as home secretary. Stephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster, told BBC Radio Scotland this morning that the government’s immigration crackdown would wreck the economy. He said: I think it’s absurd, I think it’s ignorant, and it’s going to wreck the economy because we know that migrants contribute more to the UK Treasury than what they take out. James Cleverly, the home secretary, thanked Rwandans for showing him the “pain” they went through as he visited a genocide memorial, PA Media reports. PA says: Cleverly was shown around the Kigali Genocide Memorial, which honours the hundreds of thousands of victims of the 1994 atrocity. He follows in the footsteps of predecessors Dame Priti Patel and Suella Braverman, who both made private visits to the site during their trips to Rwanda over the last 18 months. After seeing a memorial garden and historical exhibits accompanied by centre staff, Cleverly signed a visitor book with a message saying: “Thank you for helping me see the pain you went through, but also the commitment to peace that you have chosen to make. We must never forget, but must learn, grow and work to a better future.” The UK has suffered a sharp decline in its performance in the latest round of influential international academic tests, wiping out recent progress, as the widespread disruption caused by Covid continued to take its toll on education, the Guardian reports. Yesterday, when he was being interviewed at the Resolution Foundation conference, Keir Starmer was asked by Zanny Minton Beddoes, the editor of the Economist, if he could say in what way his policies were different from the Conservatives’. Starmer was able to provide a half-decent answer, but he did not entirely dispel her suggestion that in many areas the policy overlap is getting more and more pronounced. Starmer was speaking before James Cleverly announced his immigration crackdown. If Minton Beddoes had heard Labour’s response, she might have put her question even more forcefully. That’s because, while the party has insisted that the announcement is proof that the government has failed on immigration, it has not committed to reversing any of the measures. Here is the statement that Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, issued last night. Today’s announcement is an admission of years of Tory failure on both the immigration system and the economy, as net migration has trebled to a record high under the Tories since they promised to reduce it at the last election. Labour has said repeatedly that net migration should come down and called for action to scrap the unfair 20% wage discount, raise salary thresholds based on economic evidence, bring in new training requirements linked to the immigration system, as well as a proper workforce plan for social care. Immigration is important but the system needs to be controlled and managed. But whilst the Conservatives have finally been forced to abandon the unfair wage discount that they introduced, they are still completely failing to introduce more substantial reforms that link immigration to training and fair pay requirements in the UK, meaning many sectors will continue to see rising numbers of work visas because of skills shortages. In interviews this morning Cooper was asked in more detail about some of the measures in the package. This is what she told the Today programe. Ending the 20% wage discount for jobs on the shortage occupation list Cooper welcomed this announcement, pointing out that it is something that Labour has been asking for. Increasing the minimum salary threshold for people on a skilled workers visa Cooper said Labour had been calling for this “because the Migration Advisory Committee has warned about exploitation of low paid workers under the skilled visas system”. But she did not explicitly say that she favoured the threshold going up to £38,700 (from £26,200). The MAC should be advising on the details, she said. Reviewing the shortage occupation list Cooper said the fact that the government was keeping the shortage occupation list highlighted the government’s failure to tackle skills shortages. She said: What that means is, if you’ve got a shortage occupation, not just health and social care workers – that might be also engineers, might also include now bricklayers - employers will still be able to recruit at less than the threshold. And yet the government is still doing nothing to tackle those skills. Raising the minimum income for family visas This is one of the most controversial measures in the package because it means that, if a Briton wants to marry a foreigner and bring them back to the UK, they will have to be earning £38,700 a year (up from £18,600 a year). Cooper said she would like this figure reviewed. She said: We think the Migration Advisory Committee should look at this very swiftly before it is introduced, particularly at the impact this is going to have on British citizens who fall in love across borders. But she said that she approved in principle of people being required to support family members coming to the UK. And she complained the new rule had “come out of thin air”. Asked if she would retain this rule if it were in force when a Labour government came into office, Cooper just repeated her call for the MAC to review this. It had not been reviewed for 10 years, she said. She also warned that the plan could lead to an increase in people marrying foreigners before the new limit comes into force. Care workers being no longer allowed to bring in dependants Cooper said Labour supported the changes to people on graduate visas being able to bring in dependants. On the proposal for care workers, she said, again, the MAC, should look at this. There has been a big increase in the number of care visas being issued, she said. She said Labour wanted a fair pay agreement to make care jobs more appealling to British workers. Deportation flights to Rwanda will take place before the next election, Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, said this morning. Ben Quinn has the story. Prof Brian Bell, chair of the Migration Advisory Committee, said some industries could struggle with recruitment because of the government’s new visa rules. He told Times Radio this morning: I think we’re going to see quite a lot of what you might describe as middle-skilled jobs that are going to struggle. Social care will still be allowed to employ people at lower wages, the big change is workers won’t be able to bring their dependants with them, and that’s a fundamental change. Rishi Sunak will be on the “wrong side of history” in his handling of the infected blood scandal, the head of a charity has warned, after his government suffered its first parliamentary defeat over when to compensate victims, Jamie Grierson reports. In his interviews this morning Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, claimed the UK would benefit from the immigration crackdown announced yesterday. Jenrick claimed the measures would benefit the economy. He told Times Radio: We believe that this will be good for the economy because it will encourage employers in particular, to invest in their own workforce, raising skills levels, investing in technology and efforts to improve their productivity. It will help more people off welfare and help those who are economically inactive. He also claimed the economic impact of the proposals had assessed, and discussed with the Treasury and the Office for Budget Responsibility. “So we’ve taken this in a very considered way,” he said. And he claimed it would help social cohesion. He told Sky News: We want to help people on welfare and into work. We want to reduce pressure on housing and public services, and also to build a more socially cohesive and united country, which is difficult, I would argue impossible, when such large numbers of people are coming into the country. Last night Suella Braverman, the former home secretary and the most prominent voice on the Tory right for tighter immigration controls, gave a qualified welcome to the immigration crackdown. It was “a step in the right direction”, she said in a thread on X. But she said it was too late to have an impact on numbers before the general election, and she said further measures were needed. Among other things, she called for an annual cap on immigration numbers. As well as these proposals, we should go further: shortening the graduate route - not just reviewing it again; &amp; we need an annual cap, set by Parliament, across all visa routes, so we don’t get into this terrible situation again &amp; government can be properly held to account. This morning Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, was asked if he favoured an annual cap. He told Times Radio: There are merits to ideas like that. But what matters now is action. The public wants to see us actually deliver reducing levels of net migration, as I’ve been very clear, that people are sick of talk on this topic. In this answer Jenrick sounded more positive about the cap proposal than his boss James Cleverly, the home secretary, did when he was asked about it in the Commons yesterday. Good morning. Most government announcements have only a limited impact on life as its lived in the UK – in other words, you have to look hard to notice – but yesterday’s plan to slash immigration numbers was probably an exception. It is intended to close down very high immigration as a component of the economy. It won’t stop all immigration by any means, but if it achieves what ministers expect, it will deliver a noticeable jolt to how the UK functions. The announcement has had a good reception in the parts of the press that matter most to No 10 (not the Guardian), but even if it reduces net migration by 300,000, as the Home Office expects, that will not meet the Conservative party’s manifesto pledge of getting it below the level it was in 2019 (around 230,00). Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, has been giving interviews this morning and he said the government remained committed to that target. Speaking to Times Radio, he was evasive about whether it would be possible to achieve this before the next election, but he said if further measures were needed, beyond what was announced yesterday, the government would act. He said: If we need to take more action then we will because we’re determined to meet the manifesto commitment and to ensure net migration is reduced. We all stood on that manifesto in the 2019 election and we’re determined to meet it as quickly as possible. If we need to go further, and we may well do, then we should and we will, because I’m determined that we meet that manifesto commitment. I will post more from his interviews shortly. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Rishi Sunak chairs cabinet. Morning: James Cleverly, the home secretary, is due to sign a treaty with Rwanda in Kigali. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 11.30am: Victoria Atkins, the health secretary, takes questions in the Commons. Around 3.20pm: David Cameron takes questions for the first time in his new role as foreign secretary. If you want to contact me, do try the “send us a message” feature.

       "     'bodyText': 'Time has lost its meaning. No longer linear. The Newtonian laws of physics discarded. Rather, time now bends and twists, reaching back on itself. Forget the circular, we are now moving forwards into the past. The present becoming ever more fragmented into an 11-dimensional world. Each with its own reality and space-time continuum. Things are now out of date before they’ve even happened. Not so long ago, a government published its legislation programme at the beginning of each parliament. MPs on all sides more or less knew where they stood. No more. Rishi Sunak has created a quantum government. One that’s racing ever faster to oblivion. It began with the first reset. A month or so after he took office. That reset crashed and burned. Of course it did. He’s hopeless. The politician who is rubbish at politics. That reset was inevitably followed by a second reset. One in which Rishi was the change candidate for a government that had been in power for 13 years. Sometimes, he’s frighteningly stupid. The rest of the time he’s just frightening. His self-destruction almost unmatched among recent prime ministers. And that’s including Liz Truss and Boris Johnson. As each reset inevitably fails, so we have been presented with more and more. The arc of failure is ever faster. Reset piled upon reset. First once a month. Then once a fortnight. Once a week has come and gone. As has once a day. Now a reset policy is dead in the water before it’s even happened. Politics reduced to a barnyard performative farce. And who better to front up the latest embarrassment than the home secretary, James Cleverly? Any prime minister’s useful idiot. Someone who would do or say anything in exchange for the trappings of power. Who doesn’t actually believe in anything. Beyond his own survival. Just give him a shiny toy for his office desk and he’s a happy boy. So shortly after 4.30 on Monday afternoon, Jimmy Dimly swaggered into the Commons to give a statement on legal migration. To basically say that the prime minister’s immigration plan up till yesterday was no longer the current plan. Moreover, the former plan had never actually been anything to do with Sunak. It had belonged to a previous government that had nothing to do with the present one. Keeping up with Dimly’s stupidity is surprisingly hard work. It was like this. Immigration was far too high. Jimmy D knew this because all the far right of the Tory party were complaining about it. Not that there are any sensible centrist Tories left. Being mad is now part of the brand. Anyway, back to immigration. He had no idea quite how it had got so high. It had sort of crept up while no one was looking. And as usual there would be hell to pay when he found out who was responsible. Brexit. People had voted to take back control. To kick foreigners out of the country. And he, the Great Dimly, was all for being as unpleasant to immigrants as possible. It’s what people wanted. Sadly, he wasn’t quite bright enough to join the dots. To make the correlation between the UK leaving the EU and immigration going up. That Brexit had all been based on a lie. That without immigrants our economy would barely function. Would be in recession. “So I am introducing my five-point plan,” Jimmy D continued. Like so much of what the home secretary says, this was untrue. It was actually the five-point plan that Suella Braverman and “Honest Bob” Jenrick had wanted to introduce, which Sunak had vetoed because it was insane. Honest Bob was on the government frontbench looking pleased with himself. His default setting. At the mention of the five-point plan, he ripped off his shirt and raced the length of the chamber. Yelling “get in” and “death to all foreigners”. So sweet. Point one, said Dimly. Clear out the dependants of scumbag international students. Point two. Get rid of all foreign care and NHS workers. Fuck them! Point three. Get rid of all other foreign workers in shortage areas. Fruit and vegetable pickers. Go back to wherever you came from. There were no points four and five. They had just been there to sound comprehensive. As if this was thought through. Or maybe Jimmy D just couldn’t remember them. Maybe four and five were just to be more and more beastly to foreigners. There we had it. Dimly sat down with a huge smirk. Revelling in his own smugness. His intellectual inferiority. Because what he had just done was effectively torch the economy. There would be no one left to fill the vacancies in the NHS and social care sector. Public services that were already on a knife-edge would now implode. Hospitality and agriculture would be dead. But what the hell? Who cared about the economy so long as halfwits like Lee Anderson were happy. Far better to do that than actually to explain to people that there were serious consequences to delivering the half-arsed ideas they had promised. Crediting voters with intelligence was no way to go. Even better, it wasn’t even as if this lunacy would win them an election. What he was really doing was creating an impossible mess for Labour to inherit. Win, win! By now, Jimmy D was on a roll. Completely deranged. Laughing and congratulating himself on his lobotomy. Labour didn’t have a plan, he observed. Before in the same sentence saying they did have a plan. Which he thought was the same as his. To make the country economically ungovernable. It’s a view, I suppose. Still, he waved his arms around a lot. So he got some exercise. You’d have thought the Tories would have been out in force for this one. Turkeys voting for Christmas. But only a hardcore of about 30 had appeared for the statement. All but one – George Eustice, who got disapproving looks from his colleagues – had come to hail their Caesar. It was only right that the NHS and social care be dismantled. And they would all be delighted if their mums and dads were the first to die as a result. It would be an honour for them to die knowing that they had paid the ultimate sacrifice for an England for Little Englanders. Dimly bathed in the glory. Next stop, Africa. To sign a treaty declaring that Rwanda would be really nice and wouldn’t shoot refugees as it had in the past. That should do it. What could possibly go wrong?

       "     'bodyText': 'James Cleverly, the home secretary, has triggered alarm in the health and care sectors by announcing sweeping plans to restrict immigration. He said the measures would cut annual immigration by 300,000 and, promoting the plans on social media, the Conservative party described this as the “biggest ever cut in net migration”. In the Commons the proposals were welcomed by Tory MPs, many of whom have been demanding much stricter controls since the publication of figures showing net migration at a record high of 745,000 last year. Cleverly said criticism of the plan from Labour MPs showed the opposition was not serious about wanting to reduce immigration. He also dismissed claims that the plans would exacerbate worker shortages in the health and social care sectors, where employers rely on foreign staff. The impact would not be “significant”, he claimed. (See 4.45pm.) But health and care sector leaders said they were alarmed by the plans. Miriam Deakin, director of policy and strategy at NHS Providers, which represents hospitals and other NHS bodies, said: With over 120,000 staff shortages in the NHS and over 150,000 in social care, measures that deter people from joining these professions are deeply concerning. The NHS Long Term Workforce Plan is clear that international recruitment will continue to play a key role in the NHS’s future, alongside domestic training. We therefore need the health and care sectors to remain attractive not only to domestic workers but also to those educated internationally. Caroline Abrahams, a director at Age UK and co-chair of the Care and Support Alliance, which represents more than 60 charities, said: We are worried that older and disabled people in need of care, and their families, will pay a heavy price for the government’s changes to the migration rules from next Spring. It is an open secret that inward migration effectively ‘saved’ the social care workforce last year and, as things stand, anything that undermines that source of support must be a real concern. Too many people in need struggle to access good care as it is, and the risk is that today’s announcement will make the situation worse. And Prof Nicola Ranger, chief nurse at the Royal College of Nursing, said: Ministers appear comfortable with tearing apart families to score political points. This cruel sanction will deter care workers from coming to the UK, adding to dire workforce shortages in social care and ultimately piling even more pressure on an overburdened NHS. The home secretary admitted in his own announcement in the Commons that health workers with families will be put off joining our short-staffed health and care services. A Labour government must shed the assumption that public spending is “the only lever that can ever be pulled” to improve people’s lives, Keir Starmer has said, as he refused to rule out keeping planned cuts to government departments if he won power. Jeremy Hunt has blamed Brexit for more than half a decade of political instability that has undermined business investment in the UK, as he sought to defend tax cuts paid for by public sector austerity to drive up economic growth. The UK’s return to the EU’s flagship Horizon science research programme was formally signed off in Brussels today by the science and innovation secretary, Michelle Donelan, and her European counterpart, Iliana Ivanova. “Watch this space because we are expecting this to be incredibly useful tool with some exciting times ahead,” said Donelan. The return ends a two-year absence from the £85bn programme in a tit-for-tat row over the Brexit trading arrangements in Northern Ireland. Despite the UK government threatening for years to boycott Horizon and go it alone, today Donelan was brimming with enthusiasm for the programme. She said: I just think that we as a nation in the UK need to be really ambitious and seize this opportunity. And, and that’s why we are, as a department, really going to invest the time and the energy to try and make sure that our participation punches above its weight. This is, as I said before, something that the sector actively lobbied for. So we’ve got no concerns about that. But we really want to maximise this opportunity. Among the initiatives is a campaign to attract people who have never engaged with Horizon before with £10,000 in “pump priming” funding available to first timers, she announced. This is from Stuart Hoddinott, a researcher at the Institute for Government thinktank, on the immigration crackdown. Keir Starmer’s Labour party is running late in seeking formal talks with senior civil servants ahead of the next general election, a thinktank has warned. The Institute for Government (IfG) urged Labour to request the process “as soon as possible” or risk seeing their policies delayed if they were to win. Emma Norris, deputy director of the IfG, suggested Labour’s delay at requesting the talks could mean the party is unsure on what it wants to offer the country. Usually, transition access talks start around 16 months before the end of parliament in the run-up to a predictable election. Before the 1997 election, Tony Blair’s team came in with “big plans” for the minimum wage, Bank of England independence and devolution “quite ready to go on day one”. Starmer’s office is understood to be not planning to request the access talks until the new year at the earliest. Norris warned the party would not be able to “move fast enough” with its priorities and could fall into some of the “bear traps” of poorly thought-through policy. “Labour has its five missions prepared and lots of smaller policies but they haven’t gone far enough on prioritising meaty policies that will sit under the missions,” Norris told reporters. The IfG also urged Labour not to make any more reshuffles ahead of the next election, to maintain a level of policy experience. “Even if the election happens at the last possible moment, they’re running late,” Norris said. Christopher Hope from GB News says, even with the new measures, the government will not cut immigration to the level promised in the 2019 manifesto. The SNP says the immigration controls will be bad for Scotland. Chris Stephens MP, the party’s immigration spokesperson, said: It is clear that the biggest threat to Scotland’s NHS is Westminster control. Scotland is already suffering from labour shortages as a result of Westminster’s Brexit and migration policy – particularly within our public services – and the steps set out today will further hamper our ability to recruit from overseas. Both the Tories and Labour are wedded to this flawed plan along with the privatisation of our NHS. Just yesterday Sir Keir Starmer praised Margaret Thatcher – the architect of NHS privatisation – of delivering “meaningful change” to the UK. Scotland’s NHS is not safe under Westminster control no matter the colour of its government. Independence is the only way we can get rid of Westminster governments we don’t vote for for good and create an immigration system that meets the needs of Scotland’s public services. In Scotland the public debate about immigration is quite different from in the rest of Britain because Scotland’s population is projected to fall over the long term. The SNP says that shows why Scotland needs higher immigration, and it has repeatedly called for border policy to be devolved to Edinburgh. Neil O’Brien (Con) asks Cleverly if he will publish the analysis that led him to claim that these measures would reduce immigration by 300,000. Cleverly says he is happy to put these figures in the House of Commons library (which, in practice, means making them public). Echoing what she said on the World at One earlier (see 1.39pm), Christina McAnea, the general secretary of Unison, which represents many care workers, has put out a statement describing the Cleverly proposals as a “total disaster for the NHS and social care”. She said: These cruel plans spell total disaster for the NHS and social care. They benefit no one. Migrant workers were encouraged to come here because both sectors are critically short of staff. Hospitals and care homes simply couldn’t function without them. There’s also a global shortage of healthcare staff. Migrants will now head to more welcoming countries, rather than be forced to live without their families. The government is playing roulette with essential services just to placate its backbenchers and the far right. But if ministers stopped ducking the difficult issues, and reformed social care as they’ve long promised, there wouldn’t be such a shortage of workers. None of this is rocket science. Fund care properly and raise wages, and the sector becomes a more attractive place to work. But take away the migrant workers currently stopping care from going under and it collapses. Colin Yeo, a barrister specialising in immigration, says the decision to raise the minimum income for family visas to £38,700 (see 4.47pm) will make it impossible for some Britons to bring foreign spouses to the UK. Many British citizens will be unable to live legally in the UK with their spouses. This is twice the national minimum wage. A lot of people simply cannot afford it, no matter how hard they work. This is an absolute scandal yet the headlines are currently focused on care visas! I’m sorry, but migrant workers can choose not to come. This impacts British citizens and their families, who have no choice about who they fall in love with. It’s FAR more important. Cleverly says all the Labour MPs asking questions are opposing the proposals he has just announced, even though Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, says Labour is in favour of controlling immigration. Neil Coyle (Lab) says this is another example of the government’s economic future being in the hands of Tory headbangers. Tim Farron, the former Lib Dem leader, says these plans will be greeted “with absolute horror” by the Lake District tourism industry. Cleverly says ministers have discussed these plans with the Lake District Tourist Board. He says the government has analysed the impact of these plans. John Redwood (Con) says paying people more is the right model for these occupations where there are shortages. Cleverly agrees. He says Labour would do the opposite. Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former business secretary, asks Cleverly if he favour a cap on overall numbers. Cleverly says, while he can see the case for one, managing one would be difficult. He sys a cap would not differentiate between a child and and investor. Damian Green, the former first secretary of state, and a former immigration minister, says he particularly welcomes the crackdown on abuse by dependants, and the increase in the minimum income rate for family visas. He says as immigration minister 10 years ago he introduced that minimum income threshold. He was told it would be terrible for family life, but those predictions turned out to be untrue, he says. But he asks what the impact will be on the care sector. Cleverly says he has looked at this in great detail. The current scheme has led to the displacement of British workers. Globally, there is surplus demand, he says. Individuals with a family may be dissuaded from coming to the UK, he claims, but not potential workers without dependants. We do not envisage there being a significant reduction in demand [for care visas]. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, points out that only recently the government was adding occupations to the shortage occupation list. And she challenges Cleverly to explain what the government is doing to address skills shortages. The government does not have a plan, she says. Cleverly is now covering the other measures. UPDATE: Cleverly said: We will stop immigration undercutting the salary of British workers. We will increase the skilled worker earnings threshold by a third, to £38,700 from next spring in line with the median full-term wage for those kinds of jobs. Those coming on health and social care visa routes will be exempt so we can continue to bring in the healthcare workers on which our care sector and NHS rely. Thirdly, we will scrap cut-price shortage labour from overseas by ending the 20% going-rate salary discount for shortage occupations and reforming the shortage occupation list. I have asked the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) to review the occupations on this list because of our new higher-skilled worker salary thresholds, and we will create a new immigration salary list with a reduced number of occupations in co-ordination with the MAC. Fourthly, we will ensure that people only bring dependants who they can support financially by raising the minimum income for family visas to the same threshold as the minimum salary threshold for skilled workers, which £38,700. The minimum income requirement of £18,600 has not been increased since 2012. This package of measures will take place from next spring. Finally, having already banned overseas masters students from bringing family members to the UK, I have asked the Migration Advisory Committee to review the graduate route to prevent abuse, to protect the integrity and quality of the UK’s outstanding higher education sector. It needs to work in the best interests of the UK, supporting the pathway into high quality jobs for the global talent pool but reducing opportunities for abuse. Cleverly is announcing the measures in detail. First, he says he will stop the “abuse” of health and care visas. The government will stop overseas care workers from bringing family dependants and care firms will have to be regulated by the Care Quality Commission in order for them to sponsor visas. UPDATE: Cleverly said: The first of our five points will be to end the abuse of the health and care visa. We will stop overseas care workers from bringing family dependants and we will require care firms in England to be regulated by the Care Quality Commission in order for them to sponsor visas. Approximately 120,000 dependants accompanied 100,000 care workers and senior care workers in the year ending September 2023. Only 25% of dependants are estimated to be in work, meaning a significant number are drawing on public services rather than helping to grow the economy. We recognise that foreign workers do great work in our NHS and health sector, but it is also important that migrants make a big enough financial contribution. Therefore, we will increase the annual immigration surcharge this year by 66% from £624 to £1,035 to raise on average around £1.3bn for the health services of this country every year. Cleverly says the public expect the government not just to stop the small boats, but to cut legal immigration too. From January 2024 the right of international students to bring in dependants will be stopped unless they are on a postgraduate research programme, he says. But today new measures are being announced, he says. He claims the measures will reduce immigration by about 300,000 compared with last year’s figures. UPDATE: Cleverly said: From January 2024, the right for international students to bring dependants will be removed unless they are on postgraduate courses designated as a research programme. We always want to attract the global brightest and best. We have also stopped international students from switching out of the student route into work routes before their studies have been completed. These changes will have a tangible impact on net migration. Around 153,000 visas were granted to dependants of sponsored students in the year ending September 2023, today I can announce that we will go even further than those provisions already in place, with a five-point plan to further curb immigration abuses that will deliver the biggest ever reduction in net migration. In total, this package, plus our reduction in students dependants will mean around 300,000 fewer people will come in future years than have come to the UK last year. James Cleverly, the home secretary, starts by saying legal migration is too high. The government is taking “more robust action” than any previous government to bring it down, he says. Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, says Keir Starmer is wrong to claim that Labour would be able to spend £28bn on its green jobs investment programme while staying within the fiscal rules to bring down debt. (See 2.45pm and 3.09pm.) In a response to Starmer’s speech and Q&amp;A issued by Conservative party HQ, Hunt said: It is economically illiterate to say you can meet a fiscal rule to get debt falling whilst at the same time increasing borrowing by £28bn a year. The sums simply don’t add up. The result of that kind of borrowing splurge would be higher taxes, higher debt interest and lower growth – on the very day Sir Keir Starmer said growth would be his ‘obsession’. Labour has not given full details of the proposed £28bn investment, or exactly when it would start. But party sources have indicated that it would include existing government capital spending on green schemes, which would reduce the level of borrowing required. The UK government is exploring the possibility of using alternative routes to deliver aid to Gaza, including by sea, Leo Docherty, a Foreign Office minister told MPs. Responding to an urgent question in the Commons, Docherty said 74 tonnes of aid have been delivered by the UK via aircraft to Gaza, adding: “We are also actively exploring other aid routes, including by sea.” He told MPs: The UK will continue in conjunction with our international partners to advocate internationally on humanitarian priorities, these include respect for international humanitarian law, the need for fuel, humanitarian access, humanitarian pauses, and an increase in the types of assistance. We are urgently exploring all diplomatic options to increase this, including urging Israel to open other existing land borders, such as Kerem Shalom. Keir Starmer’s speech this afternoon has gone down badly with the left because of what he said about public spending. (See 2.35pm.) This is from Lydia Prieg, the head of economics at the New Economics Foundation, a leftwing thinktank. Twelve years of public spending cuts and privatisation have left the foundations of our economy weak and unstable. Crumbling infrastructure and decimated public services are colliding with an ageing population. Starmer is kidding himself if he believes he can maintain current living standards, let alone improve them, without more government spending and investment. It’s clearly important to manage public finances responsibly, and any government will have plenty of ways to safely raise funds for vital public spending. They could start with some easy choices, like undoing tax cuts that benefit the very richest. Reversing the tax cuts in last month’s autumn statement would raise around £20bn. When it comes to borrowing, recent UK bond sales show there is market demand for more UK government debt, and we still have a debt-to-GDP ratio well below similar economies like the US, Japan and Italy. And this is from a spokesperson for the leftwing Labour group Momentum. Coming a day after praising Thatcher and her legacy, these are deeply worrying remarks from Keir Starmer. The Tories’ economic strategy of austerity and privatisation has pushed Britain to the brink, with our public services on their knees and millions of people up and down the country struggling to make ends meet. Yet instead of laying out a popular alternative based on public ownership and public investment, the Labour leadership is adopting the Tories’ failed economic approach. Starmer’s stance isn’t just out of touch with Labour members and voters – but with the public too. Tragically, by following this recipe for failure, he risks making a rod for his own back in government. The Scottish National party claims Keir Starmer’s comments over the weekend, praising Margaret Thatcher and referring (in his Sunday Telegraph article) to the “possibilities of Brexit”, and his speech this afternoon, ruling out a swift rise in public spending (see 2.35pm), show he is not in tune with Scotland’s values. In a statement Stephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster, said: In the last two days Sir Keir Starmer has not only celebrated Thatcher’s damaging legacy, he is now promoting a Thatcherite future. Once again, it is clear that his values are far, far removed from Scotland’s values – and that only with independence can Scotland be the fairer, wealthier nation we all want to see. In a week where he praised Margaret Thatcher – a prime minister who devastated the lives of tens of thousands of Scots – and Brexit, a Tory-driven obsession which has wreaked havoc on businesses and households, it’s clear that Sir Keir Starmer and Labour’s values do not align with Scotland. Austerity, Brexit and Margaret Thatcher – these are the values that motivate Westminster politicians like Sir Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak, and Scotland wants none of it. Q: Would you intervene to stop the BBC licence fee going up? Starmer says this is a matter for the government. He says Lucy Frazer, the culture secretary, was speaking about that this morning. And that’s the end of the Q&amp;A. Starmer says when he spoke about Margaret Thatcher at the weekend, he was making the point that her government had a sense of purpose. He says this government does not seem to have a sense of purpose. Q: If growth is slower than expected, is it the case you might not reach the £28bn green jobs investment because of the fiscal rules? Starmer says he wants to reach the £28bn in the second half of the parliament. It will be subject to the fiscal fules. But so will everything, he says. He says last year the government tried unfunded spending announcements. That did not work well. And people are paying the price, he says. But, he says, he is “confident, really confident” that he will be able to reach the £28bn because he is doing the work on growth that is needed. Q: What can you offer people that is positive? Starmer says he wants to offer people higher living standards, an energy transition that offers opportunities, an NHS that will last for decades, and opportunities for young people. He says most people think everything is not working. That is because there has been too much chopping and changing. He says he wants no more sticking plaster politics, and a long-term approach instead. Q: The autumn statement plans imply real-terms spending cuts in some areas. So can you assure people they are not facing a new era of austerity? Starmer says, if you look at Labours’s record in government, you will see a record of investment in public services. He goes on: We are a party that always invests in public services. The government is “salting the earth”, he says. It is acting in the party interest, not the national interest. They even briefed out that that is what they were doing ahead of the king’s speech, he says. Q: Will you rule out departmental spending cuts after the next election? Starmer says he is a big believer in public services. But public services do need reform, he says. He says they need to be delivered in a different way. They operate in silos too much, he says. Q: In your Sunday Telegraph article you said the Tories had failed to realise “the possibilities of Brexit”. What are those possibilities? Starmer says growth was a problem before Brexit. So it is wrong to say Brexit is the source of all economic problems. He says in some areas, like life sciences, Brexit means the UK can be more “agile”. But he also says the UK needs a better relationship with the EU. Q: The Resolution Foundation report talks about a UK protocol, like the Northern Ireland one. Do you favour that? Starmer says the Northern Ireland protocol was “a step in the right direction”. He says he does not know if it would work on a UK-wide basis. Q: Borrowing to invest in the green transition was a big difference from the government. But now you seem to have given up on that. So what is the difference? Starmer says he favours a proper industrial strategy. If you go to the government’s website and search for industrial strategy, it will tell you this has been archived. Literally, he says. Q: Have you given up on redistribution? No, of course not, says Starmer. But he says it is important “to recast the way redistribution should work”. He does not just want a model that focuses on promoting growth in London and the south-east, and then redistributing that wealth. He says the whole concept of levelling up is built on the understanding that you cannot just build up some places, and leave others with just enough to get by. Q: What are the big differences between you and the Conservatives? Your policies sound similar. Starmer says the Tories have had 13 years to promote growth. On planning, he says this government banned onshore wind, and got rid of the housebuilding targets. And he says Labour has a genuine partnership with business. It is not just coffee and croissants. They are talking in detail about what Labour might do in a year’s time. He says he does not want shadow cabinet ministers having discussions in a year’s time they could be having now. Starmer has finished his speech, and he is now being interviewed by Zanny Minton Beddoes, the editor of the Economist. Q: Are you still committed to the £28bn green investment fund. At one point it was £28bn of additional funding. Then it was just £28bn of funding. Now you hardly mention it – it wasn’t in the speech. Starmer says he wants to create conditions that will ensure every £1 of public investment brings in £3 of private money. He says the £28bn will be ramped up in the second half of the parliament. It will be subject to the fiscal rules. But, he says, if he gets the growth he wants, he will be able to do the investment he wants within the fiscal rules. Starmer says Labour will be “ruthless when it comes to spending every pound wisely”. He says: There are millions of people in this country right now, who wake up in the morning and know the day will bring a fresh fight for every penny. Just like the last day. My sister is one of them. I will say to her – let’s go to the pub for lunch. And she will say, straight away – “I’ll make sandwiches”. So I have said to every member of my shadow cabinet, when they are drawing up their plans for our manifesto, think carefully about how precious every pound is for the people we must serve. Hold them in your minds’ eye. And approach the public finances – spending decisions – like it’s their money. Because at the end of the day: it is. Starmer says Labour won’t be able to “quickly turn on the spending taps”. He says: The path to public service investment and keeping taxes competitive. It will be a hard road to walk – no doubt about it. Anyone who expects an incoming Labour government to quickly turn on the spending taps, is going to be disappointed. Starmer say he won’t announce Labour’s spending plans now. But he says the decisions taken by the Tories will constrain what he can do. He says: While I welcome some of the individual measures in the autumn statement – tax cuts for working people are a good thing – it was also a budget for growth that ended up downgrading growth. And a budget for tax cuts that confirmed the highest tax burden since the war. A fiscal sleight of hand. That showed the government is quite prepared to salt the earth of British prosperity, in pursuit of its political strategy. Now – I don’t think any of you expect me to announce Labour’s spending envelope on this stage, today. And I won’t. Nonetheless, it’s already clear that the decisions the government are taking, not to mention their record over the past 13 years, will constrain what a future Labour government can do. Starmer says Labour’s approach will be dominated by what Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, calls securonomics. In a single word it captures all the insights that will shape this era – and our approach. First, that the stability we enjoyed during “the great moderation” – that period of calm before the financial crash, and the conditions it provided for hyper-globalisation – that era is over. Cooperation and trade must now respect a mutual need for security. Second, that broad-based growth – economic security for every community – is now the only way to a stable politics and national unity. In short, we have to deliver on levelling up. We have to provide a more secure foundation for working people to get on, with cheaper bills, more home ownership and stronger worker rights. But most of all, we have to provide sustained economic stability. Starmer says growth will be the priority for Labour if it wins the election. The defining purpose of the next Labour government, the mission that stands above all others, will be raising Britain’s productivity growth. A goal that for my Labour party will be an obsession. That’s a big change for us. Having wealth creation as your number one priority, that’s not always been the Labour party’s comfort zone – trust me! But that’s the change I knew was necessary, that’s the change I’ve delivered, and my party is united behind it. Starmer explains what a fall in living standards over the course of a parliament means in real terms. What this does to a country, the cultural trauma, this needs to be understood. I go back to the 1970s, growing up in an ordinary working class household. A decade where we had our fair share of cost-of-living crises. I know what this feels like. I know, when you’re struggling to make ends meet, and we were, that the natural response of working people – to work harder and harder – can feel like you’re running faster and faster into a brick wall. That rising prices create this kind of “what next” anxiety and a fear, and it really is that, of going to the shops because of the decisions you might have to make. And yet that graph shows, unequivocally, that this is worse than the 1970s. Worse than the recessions of the 1980s and 1990s. Worse even than the global crash of 2008 … What this feels like is a clouding over, a loss, of the future. Because what my parents felt in the 1970s is that while day-to-day life was often very tough, the future would be a happier place, Britain would be better for your children and hard work, in the end, in the long run, would be rewarded. And that was a comfort to them, a security blanket – if you like. But one, which for working people in Britain now, sadly no longer exists. Keir Starmer is in thinktank mode. He starts by referring to a graph – this one, from the Resolution Foundation’s report on the autumn statement, showing that living standards are falling this parliament, for the first time in modern history. Keir Starmer is about to speak at the Resolution Foundation conference. Unlike Jeremy Hunt earlier, he will deliver a proper speech before participating in a Q&amp;A. Here is our preview story based on extracts from the speech released in advance. Sir John Hayes, the rightwing Conservative MP who is a leading supporter of Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, told the World at One on Radio 4 that he welcomed the new government curbs on immigration. He said: The government has finally, it seems to me, seen sense. You can’t have 1.3 million people entering the country over two years without catastrophic consequences.” There’s been a naivety on the part of some of the people advising government but actually that’s now been put aside and we’re seeing sense, we’re doing the right thing by the British people. Asked about the impact on social care, he said it was “not that complicated”. Asked how the sector would manage with fewer foreign care workers, he replied: “The solution is to employ British workers for British jobs. It’s not that complicated.” Braverman has said that when she was home secretary she favoured tougher controls on immigration but was blocked by No 10. James Cleverly’s migration statement will now come before Oliver Dowden’s one on risk and resilience, not after as originally planned (see 12.29pm), we’ve been told. That means Clevelry will start around 4.15pm. Christina McAnea, the general secretary of Unison, which represents many workers in the care sector, has said that the tighter immigration rules being announced this afternoon will be an “utter disaster”. She made the point in an interview with Radio 4’s the World at One. Here are the key quotes. McAnea said the new rules would be an “utter disaster” for the care sector because they would lead to more workers leaving, or failing to fill vacancies in the first place. Referring in particular to the plan to limit the number of dependants care workers can bring to the UK, she said: Have they spoken to anyone in the sector about this? I suspect not. This will be an utter disaster, because what they’re doing is basically sending a really strong message to those migrant workers who are propping up our care sector, and indeed in many cases the health sector, and saying: you’re not welcome here, because we don’t want you to bring your families here. She described the plan to restrict dependants as “cruel”. She said: I think it is cruel. Remember, this is a predominantly female workforce. So we’re saying: ‘You’re allowed to come here, but you can’t bring any children, or a child, if you’ve got them.’ And to those who are already here, who do have dependants, when they come to renew their visa, presumably they will be told you have to send your children back again. What do you think is going to happen? I suspect most of them will leave. She called for a major improvements in the way care workers are treated, including better pay. People were leaving because they could earn £2\/3\/4 an hour more working in a supermarket, she said. She said a national care service was needed. Here is Rajeev Syal’s story about what James Cleverly is set to announce. Yesterday the Sunday Times splashed on a story saying that Rwanda would get at least £15m from the UK as part of a move to clinch the new treaty being signed between the two countries. Rishi Sunak believes that upgrading the deportation agreement into a full treaty will help to address some of the concerns that led to the supreme court saying the policy was unlawful. At the Downing Street lobby briefing this morning the PM’s spokesperson played down the story, but without ruling out extra money going to Rwanda. Asked about the £15m figure, he said: Certainly I don’t recognise that figure of £15m, there’s been no request for additional funding for the treaty made by Rwanda, or not offered by the UK government. At the Commons home affairs committee last week Sir Matthew Rycroft, the permanent secretary at the Home Office, said the deportation deal did envisage further payments going to Rwanda every year, on top of the £140m already paid. The government is expected to publish the new treaty, and also details of the legislation it wants to pass to enable Rwanda deportations to go ahead despite the supreme court ruling, later this week. The spokesperson would not say when, but he told journalists: “We are still working urgently on both the treaty and emergency legislation and we will set out more information in due course.” At the Downing Street lobby briefing this morning the PM’s spokesperson would not answer questions in detail about the immigration announcement, saying that James Cleverly would be setting out the plans in parliament later. But the spokesperson said that net migration figures were too highly partly as a result of “abuse in the system” and that “that’s what we will clamp down on”. He said, by abuse, he was referring to “changes that were introduced over successive years”. Asked if he was referring to the rules about the number of dependants that people with visas can bring to the UK, he replied: “That’s a specific area I think the home secretary will talk to.” In its report last month which said that net migration reached a record 745,000 in the 12 months to the end of 2022, the Office for National Statistics said: There have also been changes in the number of dependants coming to the UK; in YE [year ending] June 2019, dependants accounted for 6% of non-EU student immigration and 37% of non-EU work immigration, which increased to 25% and 48%, respectively in YE June 2023. The Commons authorities have announced that there will be two statements in the chamber this afternoon, and an urgent question. The schedule means James Cleverly won’t deliver his migration statement until around 5.15pm, or possibly later. Here are the estimated timings. 3.30pm: Urgent question from Lisa Nandy, the shadow development minister, on Gaza. Around 4.15pm: Oliver Dowden, the deputy PM, makes the government’s annual statement on risk and resilience. Around 5.15pm: Cleverly makes a statement on legal migration. James Cleverly, the home secretary, will unveil a package of measures intended to bring down net migration after figures hit a record high, PA Media reports. PA says: He is expected to tell the Commons this afternoon that the minimum salary requirement for a skilled worker from overseas will be significantly hiked to around £38,000, a Whitehall official said. The increase from £26,200 a year for migrants coming to Britain was said to feature in a wider package to be announced as Rishi Sunak comes under huge pressure. The prime minister has vowed to “do what is necessary” to bring down net migration in the wake of an official estimate saying it had reached a record of 745,000 in 2022. Here are tweets from two experts sceptical of the JL Partners polling highlighted earlier (see 10.19am) about how Reform UK is eating into the Conservative party vote. From Keiran Pedley, a pollster at Ipsos From the FT’s Stephen Bush During his Q&amp;A at the Resolution Foundation conference, it was put to Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, that the Resolution Foundation report showed economy was suffering the equivalent of a “broken leg”. He said he did not accept that description. It was more of a sprained ankle, he said: Sometimes we forget that other countries also have the things that they need to improve. I think we shouldn’t lose confidence that we do some things absolutely amazingly. I know he’s controversial in other ways but when Elon Musk was here three weeks ago, he said there were only two centres in the world for AI, San Francisco and London. We’ve got a lot going for us, so if we’re going to go into dealing with the sprain, rather than the broken leg, then let’s do so from a perspective of positivity. MPs have launched an inquiry into the state of children’s social care in England amid growing warnings children are suffering from a lack of foster carers, and that private companies are profiting from the taxpayer by charging up to £63,000 a week for single social care placements. The House of Commons education select committee launched the inquiry with figures showing the number of children supported by social services is up 30% since 2010 and the number of care leavers facing homelessness is on the rise. The committee chair, Robin Walker, said the MPs would ask “whether the government needs to go further and faster” with changes to how the country’s most vulnerable children are cared for. Last week, the Guardian reported a warning from councils that they are being “held to ransom” by private care providers, as it emerged the taxpayer has been paying as much as £3.3m a year for single children’s social care placements. The Department for Education has identified “looked-after children market failure” as a key risk. And today, child protection experts called for an urgent nationwide hunt for thousands of new foster carers after a net loss of 1,000 families in the past year and a record number of children being placed far from home. The inquiry will get under way in earnest in 2024 and evidence can be submitted until 15 January. This is what Jack Elsom and Ryan Sabey say in their Sun story about the announcement that is coming this afternoon on measures to cut immigration. The PM is expected to dramatically hike the salary requirement for overseas workers to £38,000 alongside further limits on them bringing family. He has been under enormous pressure to get tough after figures showed 745,000 came to Britain last year … The current minimum salary for foreign workers is just above £26,000. And this is what Charles Hyman and Ben Riley-Smith report in their Telegraph story. It is understood that the number of dependants that social care workers are allowed to bring into Britain will also be scaled back. Home Office figures showed that visas granted to foreign health and social care workers more than doubled to 143,990 in the year to September. Those migrants brought in a total of 173,896 dependants. The total number of NHS and social care visas may also be limited, as proposed by Mr Jenrick under a five-point plan to reduce net migration. The fifth proposal is expected to increase the minimum £18,600 income required for a British citizen to bring a spouse or dependant into the UK on a family visa. There will also be an overhaul of the shortage occupation list, under which companies can pay foreign workers in shortage areas 20 per cent below the going rate. Sources said it would be “widely scrubbed” with a high bar set for any exceptions. There had been concerns that ending the exemption for care workers could worsen severe shortages in the care sector. These proposals are largely in line with measures that Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, has reportedly been pushing No 10 to adopt. But Jenrick reportedly favoured raising the minimum salary threshold for a work visa to £35,000. Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, and Boris Johnson, the former PM, have both been pushing for £40,000 to be the minimum salary threshold. Rishi Sunak is going to announce plans to cut immigration today, it is being reported. The Sun says he will announce that the salary threshold for people wanting to got a work visa to come to the UK will rise to £38,000. The Daily Telegraph is reporting something similar, quoting a Whitehall source as saying: “People will be surprised at how strong a package it is.” This is from the Telegraph’s Ben Riley-Smith. It has been confirmed to the Guardian that the announcement is coming later today. Q: Why do you think the UK still has a productivity problem when it is good at innovation? Hunt says productivity is driven by a combination of human capital, businesss investment, regional factors, and “total factor producivity”, which includes the ability to innovate. The UK has been good on the latter, he says. It has been less good at investment. And, on human capital, it has been good at university-level skills, but not so good at vocational skills, he says. Q: What will you do to support people in debt? Hunt says he has promoted the mortgage charter to help people struggling to pay their mortgage. Minton Beddoes is now taking questions from people in the audience. Q: Are you worried about the impact of spending cuts on the creative industries? Hunt says he sees the creative industries as an area of national advantage. He says there has been an increase in film-making in the UK. The film industry is an offshoot of the technology industry, because special effects are so important. And he says public service broadcasting is central to what makes the UK attractive. Q: How can you claim to be the party of planning reform when your MPs keep blocking planning reform measures? Hunt says all parties have to manage their MPs. But he claims that, for the last year for which full figures are available, housebuilding numbers were higher than under Labour. Jeremy Hunt said the UK could be the “most prosperous” economy this century because of its “untapped potential”. Speaking at the Resolution Foundation conference, he said the industrial sectors that would grow the fastest were the ones “where we are doing really well”. He said: If I was going to choose one country in the world that had the most untapped potential to become the most prosperous 21st century economy, it would be Britain. UPDATE: Hunt said: If I was going to choose one country in the world that had the most untapped potential to become the most prosperous 21st century economy, it would be Britain. And why is that? … Most of all because the sectors that are going to grow the fastest this century are the sectors where we are doing really well. Technology is the obvious one. We have a technology sector that’s double the size of Germany, three times the size of France. If you ask why it is that we’ve grown faster than Germany since 2010, despite their higher productivity, it is because we are actually stronger in innovation. So if we could solve the productivity bit, there would be no stopping us. And the reason I think that is an omission [from the Resolution Foundation’s report] is because, you spend a lot of time rightly talking about our strength in the service sectors, if you’ve done an equivalent report in the 1980s and not mentioned Big Bang in the City of London, which has gone on to be an area of global leadership for the UK, you’d be ignoring the sector that whose taxes now fund half the cost of the NHS. So I think you have to think about technology, AI, life sciences, clean energy, creative industries, because those are the sectors that are going to be really important for us going forward. Q: Ministers keep changing posts very often. Do you accept that volatility is a problem? Hunt says that volatility is not a good thing, but he says it was a consequence of Brexit and the parliamentary problems that followed that. He says he wants to see more stability going forward. Q: What about institutional reform. The Economist recently published an article saying it was too short-termist. Hunt says he normally agrees with the Economist, but he suggests he did not agree with that article. He says the argument might be right historically. But he says since he has been at the Treasury he has found it very pro-growth. Hunt says the government wants to speed up the time it takes to get a connection to the national grid by 90%. Zanny Minton Beddoes, the editor of the Economist, is interviewing Hunt. She says he has mentioned the 110 policies, but she wants to know what the growth strategy is. Hunt says he wants to improve productivity. And he says he takes a very clear view as to where the UK’s competitive advantage lies. Outside the US, it has the best higher education sector, and the best financial sector, he says. He says it needs to focus on innovation. From Peter Walker Jeremy Hunt is speaking now at the Resolution Foundation conference. He says its Ending Stagnation report is interesting, and asks the right questions. But he says Torsten Bell’s summary ignored the context – that Britain was affected by the worst financial crisis since the second world war about 15 years ago. He also says the report was written before the autumn statement – which contained 110 growth measures – was delivered. Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, is about to speak at the Resolution Foundation’s conference. Torsten Bell, the thintktank’s chief executive, has just been presenting the main findings from its 300-page Ending Stagnation report. Here are two extracts. This one has 10 facts about the economy. And this one has 10 proposals. The BBC will receive a below-inflation increase to the licence fee, the culture secretary, Lucy Frazer, has in effect confirmed after Rishi Sunak said he welcomed cuts made by the corporation to its spending and services. Peter Walker has the story. According to a poll by JL Partners, Rishi Sunak now has even less support from people who voted Conservative in 2019 than Liz Truss did when she was PM. Alex Wickham has written up the findings for Bloomberg and he says it is the rise of Reform UK that is hurting the Conservatives most now. Wickham says: Just 59% of voters who backed the Conservatives under Boris Johnson at the 2019 election are sticking with the party under Sunak, the report found. That’s down from 74% in August 2022, and from 63% in the aftermath of Truss’s disastrous “mini-budget” in September 2022, which roiled markets and brought about the abrupt end of her premiership. That event had been seen as the polling nadir for the governing Tory party. It’s the rise of Reform UK, a right-wing anti-immigration party founded with the support of former Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage, that’s most hurting the polling performance of the Conservatives under Sunak, JL Partners said. While some 5% of 2019 Tory voters have switched to the centrist Liberal Democrat party, 15% are now backing Reform. That’s around 1.5 million people. Reform has overtaken the Lib Dems as the third party in the North of England, Midlands and Wales, the report found, with the latter party now polling worse than its 2019 result. Around 18% of 2019 Tory votes have gone to Labour. And this is from James Johnson, the pollster who co-founded JL Partners and who used to work for Theresa May in No 10, on how the Tories should respond to these findings. Only one option for the Conservatives now: go big on immigration or go home Rishi Sunak is seen as the worst-performing cabinet minister by Conservative party members, a survey suggests. The ConservativeHome website has a panel of Tory members that it consults every month and its latest survey results show Sunak at a new low. ConservativeHome measures net satisfaction ratings and this month Sunak’s ratings are the lowest for any member of cabinet. In their write-up Paul Goodman and Henry Hill say: The biggest news is that Rishi Sunak, whose ratings have yo-yoed around during the past few months, hits his lowest trough yet in the table. Last month, in our first survey since the Conservative party conference, he was on 7.1 points and ninth from bottom. The month before, in the wake of his net zero speech, he was up to 26 points and eighth. Three months ago, he was in the red on -2.7. Minus 25.4 is a dire rating – though not as lamentable as the tooth-grindingly terrible -51.2 and -53.1 scores racked up by Theresa May and Philip Hammond in April 2019, let alone Chris Grayling’s record -71.6 score in the same poll. The fact is that during the last month every good piece of news for the government has been followed by bad. The survey also suggests that James Cleverly, the new home secretary, has seen his popularity with party members dive. Last month his satisfaction rating (+72) put him at the top of the table. But now he is 11th from the bottom, which is probably a consequence of his stance on the Rwanda deal (he does not deny calling it “batshit”) and the claim that he dismissed Stockton as a shit-hole. The UK will come back strongly to the world stage to “lead from the front” in tackling the climate crisis under a Labour government, Keir Starmer has pledged, after meeting world leaders at the Cop28 summit in Dubai. Fiona Harvey has the story. Good morning. Keir Starmer is speaking at a Resolution Foundation conference later where, as Kiran Stacey and Pippa Crerar report, he will say that Labour will not “turn on the spending taps” if it wins the next election. It is a message that firms up what he and Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, have been saying for at least a year, best understood as an attempt to neutralise what is currently the Conservative party’s main attack line against the party, but one with colossal implications for how a future Labour government might govern. Pat McFadden, the party’s national campaign coordinator, has been giving interviews this morning, but he has been preoccupied by having to clarify remarks made by Starmer over the weekend praising Margaret Thatcher. McFadden insisted that Starmer was paying tribute to her effectiveness, not her policies. McFadden told LBC: I remember when Gordon Brown was prime minister, he invited Mrs Thatcher to tea at No 10 and he described her as a conviction politician who saw the need for change, and we had some of the same fuss at that time. There’s a long history to these things, and what Keir was doing in the speech yesterday was making the same point – that there are conviction prime ministers who changed the country and he wants to be one of those, not a prime minister who drifts along and is buffeted by events. I agree that she was a conviction politician, but it’s not an endorsement of her policy, and the truth is Gordon Brown praised her, Tony Blair said she was a towering figure, now Keir’s said what he said. Every time a Labour leader acknowledges this, there’s a bit of fuss about it. On Sky News, asked if he admired Thatcher himself, McFadden said that was “not the word I’d use”. He explained: I recognise she won [the general election] three times. I would hope if we were going to win elections, we would make change with the same determination but not in the same direction. Starmer made two interventions at the weekend and in the second, an interview on Radio 4’s Broadcasting House where he was asked about his pro-Thatcher Sunday Telegraph article, Starmer stressed that he admired her sense of purpose. He said: Thatcher did have a plan for entrepreneurialism; [she] had a mission. It doesn’t mean I agree with what she did, but I don’t think anybody could suggest that she didn’t have a driving sense of purpose. But in the Sunday Telegraph article, which the paper wrote up as Starmer heaping praise on the former Tory PM, Starmer went a bit further. He wrote: Every moment of meaningful change in modern British politics begins with the realisation that politics must act in service of the British people, rather than dictating to them. Margaret Thatcher sought to drag Britain out of its stupor by setting loose our natural entrepreneurialism. Tony Blair reimagined a stale, outdated Labour Party into one that could seize the optimism of the late 90s. A century ago, Clement Attlee wrote that Labour must be a party of duty and patriotism, not abstract theory. To build a “New Jerusalem” meant first casting off the mind-forged manacles. That lesson is as true today as it was then. It is in this sense of public service that Labour has changed dramatically in the last three years. The course of shock therapy we gave our party had one purpose: to ensure that we were once again rooted in the priorities, the concerns and the dreams of ordinary British people. To put country before party. This implies admiration not just for Thatcher’s skill at using the levers of the government to implement change (which only a fool would deny), but also for her desire to unleash “natural entrepreneurialsm”. And if Starmer accepts the UK was stuck in a “stupor” in 1979, he is implicitly criticising Labour, which by then had been in power for most of the previous decade and a half. These views are still contested in Labour, although even Jeremy Corbyn when he was party leader did not propose trying to reverse the entire Thatcher economic reform agenda. Here is the agenda for the day. 10.15am: Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, holds a Q&amp;A at a Resolution Foundation conference to launch its Ending Stagnation report. He will be interviewed by Zanny Minton Beddoes, editor of the Economist. The full conference agenda is here. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 2pm: Keir Starmer speaks at the Resolution Foundation event. 2.30pm: Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, takes questions in the Commons.

       "     'bodyText': 'Robert Jenrick “rose without a trace” before becoming a cabinet minister at the age of 37, in the words of one Conservative Home columnist. He was seen as a Rishi Sunak ally who could keep a close eye on the former home secretary Suella Braverman in the Home Office. But now he is making waves as a standard bearer for the right of the Conservatives on the need to reduce net migration to the UK – going further than No 10 in suggesting ways it could be brought down and hinting at his frustration at inaction over the high numbers. The MP for Newark won his seat in a 2014 byelection after his predecessor, Patrick Mercer, resigned in a lobbying scandal. And for a long time Jenrick was an unmemorable MP, lacking any distinctive policies or causes. This started to change during his time as communities secretary, when Jenrick was embroiled in two controversies. The first was his move in 2020 to overrule a planning decision in a way that benefited the Tory donor and former newspaper magnate Richard Desmond. He pushed through the decision to approve a £1bn development of flats a day before a community levy would have come into force, providing £45m for Tower Hamlets council to spend on local infrastructure. The council challenged the decision in court and Jenrick backed down, conceding a potential for bias. It later emerged that he had sat next to Desmond at a Conservative party fundraising event in November, where the former Express owner had shown him a PR video for the 44-storey development. (Jenrick said he refused to discuss the planning application at the event.) Two weeks after the planning decision, Desmond gave the Conservatives £12,000. Amid increasing political pressure, Jenrick’s department released correspondence relating to the case that showed Desmond had texted him about the issue, and suggested that Jenrick had urged officials to complete the process before the infrastructure levy came into force. The second related to Jenrick’s moves in lockdown. The MP, a former solicitor, owns two properties in London as well as Eye Manor, a Grade I-listed home in Herefordshire, and local people have complained they do not see him in his Newark constituency as much as they would like. At the peak of the coronavirus lockdown it emerged that Jenrick had visited yet another property, his parents’ home in Shropshire. While he conceded he had done this, he said it had been to drop off food and medicines and that he had not entered their house. It also emerged that Jenrick had travelled between London and Eye Manor, rather than his home in Newark. He said Eye Manor was his family home and his family were spending the lockdown there. Yet still Jenrick would hardly qualify as a household name. He left the cabinet in 2021 in the wake of the Desmond controversy and No 10’s decision to rewrite some of his planning reforms, and he spent some time on the backbenches. Only since he returned as an immigration minister in October 2022 has Jenrick begun to make waves and win friends among Conservative rightwingers. He first caught attention in that role with his office’s decision to order murals of Mickey Mouse and Baloo from The Jungle Book to be scrubbed from an immigration detention centre over concerns they were too welcoming. Jenrick, a regular on the airwaves, appears to be deployed often by Conservative officials to avoid making news. But his claim in the House of Commons last week that he would have liked to have taken steps to reduce immigration before last Christmas raised eyebrows. Usually studiously on message, he appeared to insert a degree of distance between his own position and that of Rishi Sunak, giving the impression that he has tried harder than others to reduce immigration figures. His allies have suggested he has presented a five-point plan to No 10 on how to reduce the numbers, while insisting he was not departing from the government’s narrative. One minister who is close to Jenrick suggested that the immigration minister was positioning himself for the future. “Rob is distancing himself from Rishi, it’s as simple as that. He’s young and is in this for the long term, and can see which way it’s going,” they said. “He may have nailed his colours to Rishi’s mast initially, but if there’s going to be a new captain of the ship after the election, he doesn’t want to be too closely associated with the one that walked the plank.” Jenrick also said there were “strong arguments” for a cap on migration proposed by Braverman, who was sacked by Sunak for departing from government policy. Her political friends, including John Hayes, have publicly made clear they believe Jenrick shares their concerns about high net migration. And his political path appears to have veered off its previously steady course, away from Sunak and towards the Braverman right.'},\n",

       "    'fields': {'headline': 'Keir Starmer praises Margaret Thatcher for bringing ‘meaningful change’ to UK',\n",
       "     'bodyText': 'Keir Starmer has praised Margaret Thatcher for effecting “meaningful change” in Britain in an article directly appealing to Conservative voters to switch to Labour. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, the Labour leader said Thatcher had “set loose our natural entrepreneurialism” during her time as prime minister. “Across Britain, there are people who feel disillusioned, frustrated, angry, worried. Many of them have always voted Conservative but feel that their party has left them,” he said. “I understand that. I saw that with my own party and acted to fix it. But I also understand that many will still be uncertain about Labour. I ask them to take a look at us again.” In the article, Starmer pointed to Labour prime ministers of the past – Tony Blair and Clement Attleee – as well as Thatcher, as examples of how politicians can effect meaningful change. Starmer said it was “in this sense of public service” that he had overseen a dramatic change in the Labour party – cutting its ties with former leader Jeremy Corbyn and removing the whip. “The course of shock therapy we gave our party had one purpose: to ensure that we were once again rooted in the priorities, the concerns and the dreams of ordinary British people. To put country before party,” he said. Starmer claimed his party was “moving back towards voters” while “the Tory party has been steadily drifting away”. His praise of Thatcher – a divisive figure in British politics – is likely to raise eyebrows on the left of the Labour party. Elsewhere in the article, Starmer criticised the government’s handling of Brexit, arguing it had wasted economic opportunities made possible by the split from the EU. “They have squandered economic opportunities and failed to realise the possibilities of Brexit. They will bequeath public finances more akin to a minefield than a solid foundation,” he wrote. The Labour leader touted the party’s “iron-clad fiscal rules” in an effort to portray Labour as trustworthy on the economy. “There will be many on my own side who will feel frustrated by the difficult choices we will have to make,” he added. “This is non-negotiable: every penny must be accounted for. The public finances must be fixed so we can get Britain growing and make people feel better off.” On migration, Starmer said: “This is a government that was elected on a promise that immigration would ‘come down’ and the British people would ‘always be in control’. For immigration to then triple is more than just yet another failure – it is a betrayal of their promises.” • This article was amended on 3 December 2023. An earlier version incorrectly said Jeremy Corbyn was expelled from the Labour party, rather than having had the whip removed.'},\n",

       "     'bodyText': '“We goofed it up, you have to fix it,” the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said on Tuesday in a message to the younger generation about Brexit. Fixing it would be “the direction of travel” with regard to the UK rejoining the EU, she told an audience in Brussels. But as the fourth anniversary of Brexit approaches, is it likely that Britain’s millennials and generation Z will demand a rapprochement? For those hoping so, there is good news from polling for the Policy Institute at King’s College London, which shows these age groups (gen Z, roughly 11 to 26 years old today, and millennials, 27 to 42) have the greatest and growing confidence in the EU. Older generations are also showing progressively greater faith in the bloc, probably bolstered by the EU response to Russia’s invasion on Ukraine. Then there is polling involving more than 1,000 18- to 24-year-olds by the Best for Britain campaign group that showed in May that 58% wanted a closer relationship with the EU – almost twice as many as those who wanted things to stay as they were or become more distant. Across the whole population, 52% want things to be closer. Again, the youngest voters are more EU-friendly. And last weekend YouGov pollsters found that 60% of people aged 18 to 24 believe in hindsight that the UK was wrong to leave the EU. The poll was a relatively small sample size, but other polling reflects the same sentiment. “Young people are more likely to see Brexit as having caused more problems than it has fixed,” said Tom Brufatto, the director of policy and research at Best for Britain, which is seeking closer ties with the EU when the post-Brexit trade deal is reviewed in 2025 and 2026. “It gives us hope. Lots of the cohort of gen Zs were not able to vote in the 2016 referendum and it’s very positive to know young people have a better view of the EU and do want a better relationship with the EU. Younger people benefit from Erasmus [the university exchange funding programme that the UK quit after Brexit], from freedom of movement and all of the economic opportunities that a closer relationship would bring.” But digging deeper, attitudes become more complex. In last weekend’s YouGov polling, when asked what the UK should do “when it comes to our future trading relationship with the European Union”, only 36% of 18- to 24-year-olds said they would want to rejoin the EU. A significant minority, one in five, said the right thing would be to increase the trading relationship but not rejoin the bloc. Ipsos polling for The Rest is Politics podcast, helmed by the remainers Alastair Campbell and Rory Stewart, found that 49% of people in the 18-34 age group support a referendum on the UK joining the EU in the next five years. That does not sound like a great level of enthusiasm either. Only a third thought rejoining would improve the UK’s ability to control immigration and almost a quarter said it would get worse. “Even this age group is sceptical about the benefits in some areas, such as immigration and the UK’s ability to make its own laws,” said Ipsos’s director of politics, Keiran Pedley. “Furthermore, with a referendum … not a political reality any time soon, it is impossible to say for certain how a future vote might go. Public views on Brexit are negative today but even younger cohorts do not see it as the most important issue to them right now.” In 2019, 18- to 24-year-olds rated Britain leaving the EU the most top issue facing the UK, a tracking poll by YouGov showed. But as Brexit loomed on 31 January 2020, its salience started dropping, from about 60% of people rating it the most important issue to only 18% today. The economy, health, housing, the environment and immigration, in that order, are now the most important issues for the youngest voters. In short, the youngest generations have other things on their minds. While they may in future vote for better relationships with the EU, at least some of the polling shows von der Leyen’s hope that they will fix what she sees as the generational blunder of Brexit may remain just that.'},\n",

       "     'bodyText': 'This felt existential. As bad as it gets. The moment someone humane would call for a lethal injection. Not just the point when the Conservative party realised there was no coming back – but the time when Rishi Sunak knew the game was up. There was no fight. Just a bit of a passive-aggressive sulk. And that was only the Tory backbenchers. From the prime minister himself, just an incoherent jumble. Digging himself in ever deeper. There will be tears long before bedtime. It wasn’t meant to be this way. Rish! has been brought up to believe his entitlement is total. That anything he wants is within his grasp. All he has to do is get out of bed. And that’s not always essential. Even from under the Siberian goose down duvet, the world was his plaything. His brilliance is effortless. So when he set his sights on being prime minister it felt like an inevitability that he could bend the country to his will. That a grateful nation would kneel down before him. Yet for the first time he has encountered a spiteful reality. One that dances to its own tune. At first there was confusion. Followed quickly by denial. Now his psyche is disintegrating before our eyes. Inside a small man, there’s an even smaller toddler desperate for his mummy. Helpless. Mewling and puking. Rish! could have prepared for a couple of days for this prime minister’s questions. And still none of it would have made any difference. The King of the Road has run out of road. He just doesn’t have a good story to tell about anything. The country is visibly falling apart around him. At first it appeared only to be happening in slow motion. Now it’s on fast forward. The economy is tanking. The health service is falling apart. Immigration out of control. Sunak’s worst nightmare is bearing down on him in surround sound. And he’s not even asleep. Quite the reverse for Keir Starmer. All his ducks have lined up in a row, begging to be shot. Me, me, me. Getting closer and closer so that even he can’t miss. Generally if there’s a gag to be made, the Labour leader can find a way to mangle it. But for a magic 15 minutes or so, Starmer was blessed with the gift of the gab. The king of standup. The comedy gods were smiling. First up was a throwaway line about ancient relics. The Tory party! Boom! Boom! Then a seamless glide on to the immigration figures. Sunak could barely bring himself to stand up. Why bother, when he was just going to be knocked over time and time again. Immigration was too high, he mumbled. Though he wasn’t sure why or who was responsible. It was all a bit of a mystery. Leave it with him and he’d try to find someone qualified to answer. The marbles jokes couldn’t contain themselves. They started spilling out everywhere. Sunak had lost his! I know, I know. It’s still a bit rubbish. A bit obvious. But this is the Commons. Not the Hammersmith Apollo. Starmer gathered himself. How come Rish! had chosen to humiliate the Greek prime minister? What was it about an EU and Nato ally that he found so distasteful? Now Rishi just lost it. He was ready to declare war on Greece. Invade! Invade! Yesterday’s satire was turning out to be clear-sighted prophesy. He hates the Greek prime minister. The man was definitely a foreigner. That explained everything. And because he was a foreigner, he couldn’t be trusted. Kyriakos the Greek deserved to be deported to Rwanda. He had tried to talk about the Parthenon marbles, which were 100% British because we had stolen them. What a total shit! Beware Greeks bearing gifts … Scrub that. Beware Greeks. They were all as bad as each other. In tenser times, this might have sparked a full-blown diplomatic incident. But luckily, the Greeks understand that Sunak is only cosplaying the role of prime minister. The man really in charge of the country was Starmer. The man Mitsotakis had actually met three days earlier. The Labour leader gently explained that he had discussed immigration – ring any bells, Rish!? – before telling the Greek PM that he was going to hang on to the marbles but might be up for a loan arrangement. International relations 101. By now Sunak was a tiny puddle on the government frontbench. An unfortunate stain. He had no idea about anything. He had no idea that since Brexit, companies had been able to import foreign workers on 80% of the normal salary. He had no idea why he was even here. All he did know was that anyone who listened to Beethoven was a secret EU sympathiser. The only good music is English music. Can’t have any of that foreign rubbish. Really. This was our prime minister. One day we’ll all turn round and wonder if any of this actually happened. Starmer went for the kill. Rish! was in La-La Land. A parallel universe. A one-man war on reality. A small man with even smaller politics. Borrowing the old gag from John Smith, he was the man with the reverse Midas touch. Everything he touched turned to … Perhaps James Cleverly could finish the sentence. Jimmy Dimly became animated. He can’t resist a fight. But luckily for him the potty-mouthed homunculus who regularly takes control of Jimmy D’s brain was having a day off. “No one in Britain is listening,” wailed Sunak. It’s true. They weren’t. The person in charge of the microphones had switched off the prime minister’s so no one could hear him. The metaphors were having a car crash today. Everyone on the opposition benches burst out in spontaneous laughter. Not the canned variety you often get. This was the real thing. The Tories just sat. Inert. Shell-shocked. They shoot horses, don’t they? It got worse. It turned out everyone else, including the Conservative MPs, also wanted to have a go at him. Why was the government doing nothing about Islamophobia? Er … because it’s not that bothered about Muslims. What about the 40 new hospitals? They were definitely happening. In someone’s fantasies. Why did the OBR and the ONS think the economy was tanking? Because Jeremy Hunt was in charge of it. Where were all the immigrants? Fuck knows. The Home Office appears to have lost track of them all. Things can only get worse. Taxi for Sunak.

       "     'bodyText': 'Rishi Sunak has intensified his diplomatic spat with his Greek counterpart, accusing Kyriakos Mitsotakis of using his recent trip to London to “grandstand” over the issue of the Parthenon sculptures. Keir Starmer ridiculed Rishi Sunak’s handling of the Greek PM at PMQs, saying Sunak was engaged in a “one-man war on reality”. He also described Sunak as someone with “the reverse Midas touch”. (See 1.36pm.) Rishi Sunak has rejected the suggestion that Brexit could be in peril after Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, claimed that the UK could be on a path to rejoining the European Union. The Home Office does not know the whereabouts of 17,000 asylum seekers whose claims have been marked as withdrawn, officials have admitted. As Rajeev Syal reports, amid a stalled Rwanda deportation scheme and rising costs for housing people seeking refuge in hotels, the two most senior officials in the department told the Commons home affairs committee that marking those claims as “withdrawn” would help hit Rishi Sunak’s target of reducing the “legacy backlog” by the end of this year. Tim Loughton, a Conservative member of the committee, has just told Radio 4’s PM programme that this was one of the worst performances by senior civil servants at a committee he had ever seen. Stephen Kinnock, the shadow immigration minister, said the hearing showed that the asylum system was broken under the Conservatives. He said in a statement: Home Office officials let the cat out of the bag that under the Tories, 17,000 asylum seekers have gone missing. Labour first warned back in August that the Conservatives were cooking the asylum books by withdrawing claims for asylum seekers for spurious reasons, and then allowing those individuals to drift away undetected into the underground economy. This is more evidence of an asylum system broken by the Conservatives. Dominic Raab, the former foreign secretary and former deputy PM, has told the Covid inquiry that he does not accept the Boris Johnson goverment was a “puppet regime” run by Dominic Cummings. (See 4.50pm.) He made his case after Sajid Javid, the former chancellor and former health secretary, told the inquiry that he did think Cummings was the person really in charge in early 2020. (See 3.25pm.) Turning back to the backlog of asylum applications (see 10.38am), PA Media says data published last week showed the backlog of asylum applications – rather than individuals – stood at 122,585 as of 29 October this year, down 12% from a record 138,782 at the end of February. The “legacy” backlog of asylum applications (defined as applications submitted before June 2022, when the Nationality and Borders Act came into force) stood at 33,253 as of 29 October, down nearly a half (47%) from 62,157 on 30 July. To meet Rishi Sunak’s target of clearing the legacy backlog by the end of the year, around 16,630 applications would need to be cleared per month before 31 December. Some 12,620 were cleared between 24 September and 29 October, and 9,604 cleared between 27 August and 24 September, figures showed. Dominic Raab, who was foreign secretary at the start of Covid and who stood in for Boris Johnson after he was hospitalised, has been giving evidence to the Covid inquiry this afternoon. He said he did not accept the claim made by Sajid Javid (see 3.25pm) and others that Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s chief adviser, was really running the government in early 2020. Asked if he agreed with this view, he replied: No, I don’t … I just don’t accept the characterisation that there was some sort of puppet regime. Raab also claimed the best decisions were made with the information available at the time. He said: When I look back, I am very conscious that we made the best decisions, with the science as fluid as it was, at that point in time, and I think that’s the best you can, in good faith, do. Nottingham city council has issued a section 114 notice, in effect declaring itself bankrupt, as experts warn an increasing number of councils are “reaching breaking point”, Jessica Murray reports. Keir Starmer will attend the Cop28 UN summit in Dubai and stay for talks longer than the prime minister has made time for, as he hopes to “bang the drum for Britain”. Starmer is keen to demonstrate just how important his party deems the climate crisis is, and use the opportunity to “fight for British investment and jobs”. The opposition leader is expected to stay in Dubai for crunch talks with world leaders, days longer than the prime minister, to showcase the types of projects he’d hope to get investment for if Labour wins the next election. Starmer’s attendance at the environmental summit may impress many, given it is the first time an opposition leader has attended a Cop UN summit, especially a year before an expected election, for at least a decade. Ed Miliband did not attend Cop20 in Peru, a year before he stepped down as party leader. Jeremy Corbyn didn’t attend Cop25. A spokesperson for the Labour leader said: He aims to fight for Britain to bring jobs and investment which will cut bills, make us energy independent and tackle the climate crisis.” The transition to net zero is a vital opportunity for the country in terms of jobs, growth and the opportunity that it provides. We believe there are great opportunities for this country in terms of being able to reduce bills, and provide energy security for the country with the drive for renewables. Q: Will you put up fuel duty next year? Your plans assume it will go up, but if it gets frozen again, as usually happens, then you have lost half of your fiscal headroom. Hunt says this will be announced next year. Q: Isn’t it a mistake to make plans on the basis of tax rises that will never happen? Hunt insists that the freeze in the fuel duty rise is a temporary measure, not a permanent one. Q: What is going to happen about the HS2 station at Euston? Sir John Armitt, chair of the National Infrastructure Commission, says your plans to get the private sector to fund some of it won’t work. Hunt says he thinks the project will attract private sector finance. Q: This is the worst parliament on record for growth in real household income, isn’t it? Hunt says this parliament has had a once-in-a-century pandemic and an energy shock. The government will be judged by how it responded, he says. Q: The Bank of England says there is a 50% chance of recession next year. Last year they were saying we were facing a long recession, Hunt says. At the Treasury committee Angela Eagle (Lab) says she is concerned about the gap between rhetoric and reality in the autumn statement. Q: Taxes are up, not down, aren’t they? Jeremy Hunt says the Resolution Foundation described the tax cuts as the biggest since the 1980s. Q: The tax cuts are based on implausible spending plans, aren’t they? Hunt does not accept that. He says the tax cuts are designed to promote growth. Q: The OBR has downgraded future growth for the next three years, quite substantially. Why are you cutting public investment? Hunt says the OBR is not in line with other forecasters on those projections. Sajid Javid, the former chancellor and former health secretary, has finished his evidence to the Covid inquiry. Here are the key points from what he said. Javid said that, when he was chancellor, he felt Dominic Cumming was prime minister “in all but name”. He told the inquiry: I resigned in February 2020 before the pandemic in large measure because of the actions of Mr Dominic Cummings, who was in post at the time. I would say during my time as chancellor I considered he sought to act as the prime minister in all but name and he tried to make all key decisions within No 10 – not the prime minister. I felt that the elected prime minister was not in charge of what was happening in his name and was largely content with Mr Cummings running the government. Javid also said that at this point it was not unusual for him to get a request from No 10 that turned out to be inspired by what Cummings wanted, not be something Johnson wanted. He said many ministers felt No 10 was “dysfunctional” under Johnson in early 2020. He said: Broadly, I think it was a widespread feeling amongst a lot of the political advisers working in number 10, many ministers, that the number 10 operation collectively was quite dysfunctional. Asked how Johnson’s government compared with previous ones he had served under, he said: Certainly, I think the the extent of dysfunctionality was something I had not experienced before in any government. Javid, as health secretary, was excluded from key meetings at No 10 when the Omicron variant was on the rise, the inquiry heard. The inquiry was shown an excerpt from Sir Patrick Vallance’s diary from December 2021. Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser at the time, said: Health Secretary not invited to the meeting yesterday – quite extraordinary – Frost and Cx (chancellor) but no SoS (secretary of state) DHSC (Department of Health and social Care) – WTF. Johnson referred to people reluctant to return to the office in 2021 as “malingering” and “work-shy”, the inquiry heard. In a diary extract from July 2021, Vallance said: PM meeting – cases up, hospital admissions up. PM looks downbeat and talks of grim predictions. Saj [Sajid Javid] says ‘we are going to have to learn to live with it’, ‘and die with it’, PM says. Cx [then chancellor Rishi Sunak] pushes very hard for faster opening up and fuller opening up. Getting rid of all restrictions. Repeats his mantra ‘we either believe in the Vx (vaccine) or we don’t’. I pointed out we would be facing a lockdown now if it was not for the Vx. PM says what will we do if we make masks voluntary. What will ministers say they will do ‘sometimes I will, sometimes I won’t wear one’. ‘Are we going to encourage people to wear masks? Are we going to continue with this bollocks?’ He says he wants everyone back at work ‘we can’t have the bollocks of consulting with employees and trade unions. They need to come back to work. All the malingering work shy people’. Says how much of CS [civil service] is back ‘how would you be able to tell’ he says. Saj argues for caution. Basically it is PM and Cx against a more cautious [Michael] Gove and Saj. PM in a bad mood. End by joking ‘please record that you have overcome my natural caution and bullied me into opening up’. The whole meeting was political posturing. CS people worried. CMO and I made risks very clear. At the Treasury committee, Drew Hendry (SNP) says Hunt’s plans imply a cut in capital investment. Hunt says there was a big increase in capital spending in previous years. He says he has protected spending in cash terms, but not in real terms. Baldwin says she and Hunt both rebelled over the decision of the Boris Johnson government to cut aid spending from 0.7% of national income. Hunt says he is committed to returning aid spending to the 0.7% figure when it is possible. Baldwin says the autumn statement figures imply that will not happen in the next five years. Hunt confirms that is the case. He says: I don’t believe it is possible to budget for that [going back up to 0.7%] in the figures, no. Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, is giving evidence to the Commons Treasury committee about the autumn statement. Harriett Baldwin, the Conservative chair of the committee, starts the questioning. She says the Office for Budget Responsibility said yesterday that Hunt’s fiscal rules are the loosest of any set of fiscal rules the Treasury has had since the OBR was set up. Hunt accepts that, but he says the OBR also said that he faced the tightest set of public finances. Baldwin puts to Hunt that his fiscal rules are “mañana” ones – because they assume debt falling, but always in the future. Hunt does not accept that. He says the plan is for debt to fall. It is unusual for a Conservative MP to admit publicly that Rishi Sunak did badly at PMQs, but that is what Sir Simon Clarke, levelling up secretary in Liz Truss’s government, is saying in two posts on X. We either set out a credible plan on legal immigration, and a really robust emergency bill on Rwanda, or we face more PMQs like that one… It doesn’t matter that Labour have no plan, and no intention of acting on this issue. We are the party in government and this is a fundamental issue of trust for our voters. Labour says the issue of the Parthenon marbles would not be a “priority issue” under a Keir Starmer premiership. At a post-PMQs briefing, asked if the marbles would remain in the UK under a Labour government, a party spokesperson said: [A] Labour government will not be spending any time legislating on this matter or giving any government time to this matter. It is not a priority issue for us. There will be no change in the legal status. As you will be well aware, there are cultural exchanges that happen the whole time between institutions and government. If the British Museum and the Greek government were to come up with a loan agreement that was acceptable to both sides, then we obviously wouldn’t stand in the way of that. But it is not a process that we would be looking to insert ourselves into. Asked about fears that the Greeks would not return the ancient sculptures after such an exchange deal, the spokesperson said: Well, I think that would not meet the definition of a loan if that was the case. That is for the British Museum and the Greek government to discuss on those terms and clearly any agreement they came to would have to be compatible with the existing law because we are not looking to change the law on these matters. Predictably, Downing Street has rejected Ursula von der Leyen’s suggestion that the UK should rejoin the EU. (See 1.45pm.) Asked about her comment, the PM’s spokesperson said: It’s through our Brexit freedoms that we are, right now, considering how to further strengthen our migration system. It is through our Brexit freedoms we are ensuring patients in the UK can get access to medicines faster, that there is improved animal welfare. That is very much what we are focused on. The UK should rejoin the EU, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has said, admitting that European leaders had “goofed up” on the departure of Britain from the bloc. She made the remarks at an event in Brussels last night. Asked if the UK could ever rejoin the EU she replied: I must say, I keep telling my children: ‘You have to fix it. We goofed it up, you have to fix it.’ So I think here too, the direction of travel – my personal opinion – is clear. Her remarks at an awards ceremony staged by Politico come as relations between the EU and the UK continue to improve after a near collapse of relations under Boris Johnson and Lord Frost, who negotiated the Brexit trade deal. The new foreign secretary, Lord Cameron, made his first official return to Brussels this week after losing the keys to Number 10 in the wake of the 2016 Brexit referendum. Officially he was in the EU capital to attend a meeting of Nato foreign ministers but he squeezed in an hour-long meeting with Maroš Šefčovič, a vice-president of the European Commission and the chief Brexit negotiator following the UK’s exit from the bloc in 2020. Although Cameron had campaigned for remain, nervousness about being back in the embrace of the EU given was evident. He declined to speak to the media on his first day in the Belgian capital and refused any questions on the second. It is widely assumed that it was Tony Blair who annihilated the Tories in the 1990s, but it was his predecessor, the late John Smith, who first cemented in the public mind the idea that John Major was a hapless incompetent leading an administration of utter uselessness, and he did it in a speech in the Commons in June 1993. You can watch an excerpt here. Smith described Major as the “man with the non-Midas touch” and went on to say: “It is no wonder that we live in a country where the Grand National does not start and hotels fall into the sea.” Today Keir Starmer referenced that speech when he told Rishi Sunak: It is ironic that he has suddenly taken such a keen interest in Greek culture when he has clearly become the man with the reverse Midas touch. Everything he touches turns to … maybe the home secretary can help me out here. It is always quite risky resurrecting a joke that someone else has used brilliantly in the past. But by the time Starmer used this line, in his sixth question, he had already performed a fairly effective demolition job on Sunak, and so it worked fine. The exchanges covered immigration policy and Sunak’s row with the Greek PM, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, about the Parthenon marbles. In the long term, migration is probably the most serious problem for Sunak, but today he was at his most inept trying to justify the Mitsotakis snub. Starmer asked: Never mind the British Museum, it’s the prime minister who has obviously lost his marbles. The Greek prime minister came to London to meet him, a fellow Nato member, an economic ally, one of our most important partners in tackling illegal immigration. But instead of using that meeting to discuss those serious issues, he tried to humiliate him and cancelled at the last minute. Why such small politics, prime minister? Sunak could have tried to play down the whole affair. But instead he escalated, by denouncing the Greek PM as someone who cannot be trusted to keep his word. This is what No 10 was in effect briefing yesterday, but for the prime minister to say this in parliament, about leader of a friendly country, is highly provocative. Sunak said. Of course, we’re always happy to discuss important topics of substance with our allies, like tackling illegal migration or indeed strengthening our security. But when it was clear that the purpose of a meeting was not to discuss substantive issues for the future, but rather to grandstand and relitigate issues of the past, it was inappropriate. Furthermore … when specific commitments and specific assurances on that topic were made to this country and then were broken, it may seem alien to him, but my view is when people make commitments they should keep them. Starmer replied: I discussed with the Greek prime minister the economy, security, immigration, I also told him we wouldn’t change the law regarding the marbles. It’s not that difficult, prime minister. And then, when Sunak in his reply said that Starmer was “backing an EU country over Britain”, Starmer hit back: The prime minister is now saying that meeting the prime minister of Greece is somehow supporting the EU instead of discussing serious issues. He’s just dug further into that hole that he’s made for himself. Rather than deal with the facts, he’s prosecuting his one-man war on reality. That clinched it. Wit and eloquence can count for a lot in debate, but being right is normally even better, and Starmer’s attack was powerful today because it crystallised what many Tories, as well as Labour MPs, will be thinking. After his “hotels fall into the sea” speech (which followed Black Wednesday), Smith had the authority of a prime minister in waiting, while Major could never quite shake off the perception that he was a bit of a joke. The relationship is broadly similar today. That is not a result of today’s PMQs, but the exchanges this afternoon do confirm the picture. Deidre Brock (SNP) asks for an assurance that health data about Scottish patients won’t be released under the Palantir deal. Sunak says health policy is devolved. But he defends the policy. Jonathan Gullis (Con) says the Labour-run council in his constituency won’t let people with free bus passes use them until after 9.30am. Sunak say he backs Gullis’s campaign to get the council to change its mind. Beth Winter (Lab) says the government is not funding efforts to make coal tips safe in south Wales. Is it right that the UK took the economic benefit from Welsh coal, but will not spend money to make it safe? Sunak says the UK government is investing in south Wales. It has invested to safeguard thousands of jobs at Tata Steel. Mohammad Yasin (Lab) asks if the government will take up with the Indian government claims that India has supported attempts to assassinate Sikh activists outside India. Sunak says the government is concerned about the safety of all communities in the UK. Rachel Maclean (Con) asks Sunak to back a campaign for maternity services to be returned to the hospital serving her constituency. Sunak says decisons about services are taken locally. Sir Jeremy Wright (Con) says a constituent aged 110 is visiting Downing Street today. He says he hopes he can give Sunak advice on surviving against the odds. Sunak says he looks forward to meeting John, the constituent. Sir John Hayes (Con) asks if the government will introduce measures to cut immigration as proposed by Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister. Sunak says the government is reviewing its policies on legal immigration. And it will bring forward a bill to allow flights to Rwanda to happen, he says. Tulip Siddiq (Lab) asks about the claim in the Covid inquiry that Sunak’s view was that the government should “just let people die”. No 10 did not deny this last week. So how did people at the top of government get this idea? Sunak says he will give evidence to the inquiry. But if Siddiq had listened to the evidence, she would have seen that Sir Patrick Vallance, whose diary was quoted, said he had not heard Sunak say that. Sunak says that is because he did not say that. Siddiq is referring to a diary entry in which Vallance quoted Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson’s chief adviser at the time, as saying: “Rishi [Sunak] thinks just let people die and that’s okay.” Cummings was not quoting Sunak; he was just summarising Sunak’s position as he saw it (with characteristic hyperbole). UPDATE: Sunak said: There is an ongoing inquiry into Covid and it’s right that process is followed, and I look forward to providing my own evidence. But if [Siddiq] had taken the time to actually read the evidence submitted to the inquiry, she will have seen that … the chief [scientific] adviser confirmed that he did not hear me say that. And that’s because I didn’t. Nickie Aiken (Con) says Labour-run Westminster council is increasing parking charges for electric vehicles by up to 1,800%. Sunak says the council should rethink these plans. This is from Beth Rigby, Sky News’s political editor, on what Rishi Sunak said to Keir Starmer about the Greek PM. Former cab minister texts following PM Greece remarks at #PMQs: “Rishi on Greece is mad. He’s creacted a full diplomatic breakdown, the Greek gov are furious” Adds that Greece has done lot of work tackling illegal migration &amp; could benefit from Greek model (which they now haven’t discussed) Sarah Dines (Con) says an entire town, Bakewell, has been debanked by NatWest. As the government is the main shareholder in the bank, will it do something about that? Sunak says all customers should have access to banking services. He says new cash deposit services will be provided for Dines’s community. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, says many of the supposed 40 new hospital projects promised by the government are not progressing. Why do doctors and nurses have to suffer for years in unsafe conditions? Sunak claims “good progress is being made”. But it is right that hospitals with Raac concrete problems need to be prioritised. Philip Hollobone (Con) asks Sunak to back the redevelopment of a hospital in Kettering. Sunak says the government is committed to this project. Work should begin in the first quarter of 2024, he says. Stephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster, says it is snowing in Aberdeen. Kids will be pleased, but not their parents, who dread the energy bills. Does the PM regret not offering financial support this winter? Sunak says it is wrong to say that the government is not offering people financial support. Flynn says it is hard for Sunak to emphathise when he clearly cannot understand what people are going through. He says the SNP thinks Scotland should benefit from Scotland’s energy. Sunak says the energy grid in the UK is integrated. There are cold weather payments that kick in, and winter fuel payments, he says. Starmer says there are few things more depressing for Tories than hearing Sunak has a plan. It is fitting he turned to Greek matters this week, because he is the man with the reverse Midas touch. Everything he touches turns to – the home secretary will have the correct word, he says. Sunak says Labour backs inflationary pay rises. It has no plan for welfare. The government has just delivered the biggest tax cuts since the 1980s, and brought in investment worth £30bn, he says. Starmer says Sunak seems to be the only person in the Tory party who does not have a personal immigration plan. His own side have lost faith in him. So why should the public trust him? Sunak says the government is taking steps to control immigration. He says Starmer once said immigration laws were racist. Starmer says if Sunak thinks that meeting the PM of Greece is siding with the EU, he is digging himself further into a hole. He says he is prosecuting a one-man war on reality. Sunak says in the past Starmer said having controls on skilled migration was economic vandalism. Starmer says Sunak has no plan to cut small boat crossings. Sunak says small boat crossings are coming down. And he says Starmer will always put the interests of the EU ahead of the interests of Britain. He says only this week he said the EU anthem was the music that best sums up Labour. Starmer asks why the PM humiliated the Greek PM by cancelling his meeting with him. Sunak says it became clear that the Greek PM just wanted to grandstand. And he said he went back on an assurance (about what would be said in public about the Parthenon marbles). Sunak says, when he makes agreements with people, he expects people to keep them. Keir Starmer says, to conceal his failure, Sunak spent this week arguing about an ancient relic of little interest to the public. But that’s enough about the Tory party. He asks how the Conservative is doing in terms of reducing immigration. Sunak says the government announced the toughest measures ever to reduce immigration. It will affect 150,000 student dependants. And he claims Labour’s plan would lead to an extra 100,000 migrants coming to the UK. (This claim is misleading, as this Full Fact factcheck explains.) Greg Smith (Con) asks what Sunak is doing to continue his support for Israel. Sunak says he welcomes the extension of the ceasefire. And the government will continue to hold Iran to account, he says. Gavin Newlands (SNP) asks about energy standing charges in Scotland. Sunak says these are a matter for Ofgem. They have launched a consultation. The UK government provides a cross-subsidy worth £60 to people in Scotland, as well as the UK-wide energy support. Rishi Sunak starts with the usual spiel about his engagements – meetings with colleagues and others etc. At the Covid inquiry Sajid Javid, the former chancellor and former health secretary, is giving evidence. The inquiry has just been shown an extract from his witness statement in which he said that Boris Johnson’s cabinet lacked experience, and that ministers were chosen “with a preference for loyalty over experience”. He suggests this “caused difficulties” during the pandemic. PMQs is starting soon. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. Back at the home affairs committee, Tim Loughton (Con) has just had another go at getting answers about the number of asylum applications that have been withdrawn. (See 10.38am.) He said, when he said earlier 95% of withdrawn applications were categorised as withdrawn for “other” reasons (and not because the claims were not substantiated), he was quoting figures for the last quarter. He said that, for an application to be withdrawn on this “other” basis, either the claimant has to sign a form saying they are withdrawing their application, or they have to have left the country. He said that meant the Home Office must have information about why these applications had been withdrawn. Simon Ridley, the interim second permanent secretary at the Home Office, said the Home Office did have contact details for these people. But he said he did not have that information to hand. The hearing has now ended. Diana Johnson, the Labour chair, ended by saying the next time the two officials appeared before the committee, they should come better prepared with information. Prof Dame Jenny Harries has been giving evidence to the Covid inquiry this morning and she has had to defend an email she sent in March 2020 saying it would be “entirely clinically appropriate” to discharge Covid patients into care homes. Harries, who is now chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, was one of the deputy chief medical officers for England at the time. In an email to a Department of Health and Social Care civil servant sent on 16 March 2020 (a week before the full lockdown was announced), Harries said: Whilst the prospect is perhaps what none of us would wish to plan for, I believe the reality will be that we will need to discharge Covid-19 positive patients into residential care settings for the reason you have noted. This will be entirely clinically appropriate because the NHS will triage those to retain in acute settings who can benefit from that sector’s care. The numbers of people with disease will rise sharply within a fairly short timeframe and I suspect make this fairly normal practice and more acceptable, but I do recognise that families and care homes will not welcome this in the initial phase. Sky’s Tamara Cohen has posted the screenshot on X. Asked about the email, Harries said it “sounds awful” but was intended to provide “a very, very high level view” of what would happen if there was an “enormous explosion of cases”. She went on: It was a very bleak picture because I think the reality was this isn’t an invitation to be discharging Covid patients, it’s actually a reality that says if hospitals overflow … those who are physically well to go will go. When Andrew O’Connor, counsel for the inquiry, put it to Harries that the email implied “some degree of equanimity” about discharging Covid patients into care settings, she said that was just “an interpretation”. Harries went on: This was a very high-level picture to reinforce, if you like, the position that the country was in at that weekend, and I think we’ve heard that in other places. If people were not thinking through what likelihood was in the rising numbers of cases, as we’ve heard, I don’t think we have sensible conversations about managing risks. This is not a policy at all. This is a statement of ‘if you have a pandemic in a country, how on earth are you going to manage that exponential rise in cases?’ Back at the home affairs committee, Diana Johnson, the Labour chair, is trying to find out how much the Home Office has spent on the Bibby Stockholm barge for asylum seekers. Not for the first time this morning, she does not have much luck. Simon Ridley, the interim second permanent secretary at the Home Office, tells her they will write to the committee with this information. David Cameron, the new foreign secretary, refused to answer questions about his meeting with his Greek counterpart yesterday, which took place after Rishi Sunak snubbed the Greek PM in a row over the Parthenon marbles. But, as he arrived this morning at the Nato-Ukraine council in Brussels, he did read out a prepared statement on Ukraine. He said: Two weeks ago I was in Ukraine saying we needed to do everything we could to help the Ukrainians repel this appalling aggression by Putin. And I’ll be building consensus for that view here at Nato today. When you look at the big picture, what’s happened recently is the Ukrainians have a push to the Russian navy right back across the Black Sea. They’ve opened a shipping lane to get their exports out. Their economy is growing. And, of course, they’re knocking on the door of both Nato and the EU and getting a very warm response. These are huge achievements and our job today is to build on those achievements and work out what other concrete steps we can take to help the Ukrainians in their struggle and to show that Russian aggression must never pay. Lee Anderson, the Tory deputy chair and a member of the committee, asked Rycroft and Ridley to say how many asylum seekers whose applications have been turned down have been deported in the past three years, excluding criminals and Albanians. The two Home Office officials said they did not have those figures. They offered to write to the committee. Anderson asked if they had figures for the last year, or for the past week, or for the last six months. “Do you have any figures about anything?” Diana Johnson, the Labour chair of the committee asked. Anderson went on: I’m sorry, chair, but I find it absolutely staggering that the big boss hasn’t got a clue – not just on this question, but on nearly every other question we’ve asked today. Rycroft repeated his promise to send the figures to the committee. Loughton is now asking about the government’s plan to clear the number of “legacy” asylum applications – defined as applications submitted before June 2022, when the Nationality and Borders Act came into force. Rycroft confirms that the government expects to clear these by the end of the year. He says this has happened because more cases workers have been hired, and because more decisions are being taken a week. Loughton asks him to confirm that one reason the backlog is being cleared is because of the big increase in the number of cases being withdrawn. Rycroft says that is correct. Loughton says 17,316 claims were withdrawn between September 2022 and September 2023. He says that is a 307% increase on the withdrawal rate for the year before. Is that just “fortuitous”, he asks. Simon Ridley, the interim second permanent secretary at the Home Office, who is giving evidence with Rycroft, says it is not fortuitous. Loughton says 5% of cases were withdrawn because they were not substantiated, 95% of withdrawals were categorised as for other reasons. The previous year only 45% of withdrawals were in the other category, he says. He suggests this is strange. Isn’t it strange that conveniently, when faced with a very stiff target, there has been a three-fold increase (in withdrawals) for undetermined reasons, people magically not going forward with their claims, and where are those people? He asks what has happened to the asylum seekers whose applications have been withdrawn. Ridley replies: “In most cases I don’t know where those people are.” Loughton sounds astonished. He asks Ridley to confirm that the Home Office hasn’t got “a clue” where these people are. Ridley says these are people who made an asylum claim, were invited to interview, and did not turn up. But they have not gone home, Loughton says. Ridley says he does not know what has happened to them. Diana Johnson, the Labour chair of the committee, intervenes. She says it is “amazing” that Ridley did not come to the hearing with precise figures on these cases, and she says that he has been “really disrespectful to this committee”. After Lee Anderson questioned Matthew Rycroft, Tim Loughton, a Conservative, took him back to the cost of sending asylum seekers to Rwanda. He asked why Rycroft said he did not recognise the £169,000 per person figure when it was from a Home Office document. Rycroft claimed he had not said he did not recognise the figure. Loughton told him that is exactly what he said. Rycroft said that what he meant was that the figure was based on estimates. Lee Anderson, the Tory deputy chair and a member of the home affairs committee, asked Sir Matthew Rycroft about the clause in the Rwanda deal saying that, as part of the agreement, the UK might take some asylum seekers from Rwanda. He asked how many people might come to Britain. Rycroft refused to say. He said it was not a one-to-one agreement, and he said the government had “not got a number in mind”. He suggested that the clause was in the agreement so that, if for example someone sought asylum from Rwanda, they would not be returned to the country. Anderson then asked if the Home Office was working on a “plan B” in case the Rwanda scheme did not work. Rycroft would not use that figure, but he said the government was working on various plans. Here is the line in the agreement that Anderson was asking about. The participants will make arrangements for the United Kingdom to resettle a portion of Rwanda’s most vulnerable refugees in the United Kingdom, recognising both participants’ commitment towards providing better international protection for refugees. At the time the agreement was published, Home Office sources suggested that this clause was referring to cases where refugees might come from Rwanda to the UK in limited circumstances, such as where they might need specialised medical help. Sir Matthew Rycroft, the permanent secretary at the Home Office, has just started giving evidence to the Commons home affairs committee, and within minutes he was struggling badly. Here are the takeaways from the early exchanges. Rycroft implied that the government may be giving more money to Rwanda this year – even though £140m has been given to the country, and not a single person has been deported there yet. The Labour chair of the committee, Diana Johnson, started by asking Rycroft to say how much money the government was giving to Rwanda under the scheme. He said Rwanda had already had £120m under the Migration and Economic Development Partnership (MEDP) and £20m as an upfront payment for the costs of housing asylum seekers. He said the deal anticipated additional payments each year. But he refused to say if further payments were being made, telling Johnson that ministers had decided not to give a “running commentary”. Instead the Home Office will reveal the figure in the next set of annual accounts published next year, he said. Rycroft said the cost of sending an asylum seeker to Rwanda would be “about the same as they would be if persons were staying in the UK”. But Rycroft refused to say what those costs might be. When it was put to him that the Home Office itself published an impact assessment putting the cost per person at £169,000, Rycroft accepted that was the figure in the document, but he said the Home Office did not accept it as the accurate figure. Good morning. It’s environment day on the No 10 grid and, ahead of the Cop28 summit starting in Dubai later this week, Rishi Sunak is announcing some green initiatives. As Helena Horton reports, they include plans to designate a new national park. And, in an article for the Daily Telegraph, Sunak says he will stop councils cutting down trees without consulting residents properly. But, on net zero, Sunak has been strongly criticised by Theresa May, the former prime minister. As PM May legislated to put the 2050 net zero target into law and, speaking to the Times, she said she was opposed to the plan in the king’s speech to legislate to ensure new North Sea oil and gas licences are issued every year. Sunak has said he wants to “max out” these resources. But May said: I take a different view from the government on the oil and gas licences. This is about [a] phase-out and, ultimately, that is what it has to be about in terms of fossil fuels … Obviously, energy security for us is important but … new oil and gas licences only provide for energy security if all that energy is sold into the UK and, actually, it will be sold on the world market, so I think there are some questions around that. No 10 may want it to be environment day, but at PMQs other issues are likely to dominate. The gap between what Tory backbenchers want Sunak to do about cutting immigration, and what he seems likely to announce, seems to be growing bigger by the day, and this row is bound to come up. And Sunak is still facing widespread criticism over his decision to snub the Greek PM. Here is the agenda for the day. Morning: David Cameron, the foreign secretary, is at the Nato-Ukraine council in Brussels. 9.30am: Sir Matthew Rycroft, the permanent secretary at the Home Office, gives evidence to the Commons home affairs committee. 10am: Prof Dame Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, resumes giving evidence to the Covid inquiry. Sajid Javid, the former health secretary, is also due to give evidence in the morning. 10am: The OECD publishes its latest economic forecasts. Noon: Rishi Sunak faces Keir Starmer at PMQs. 2pm: Dominic Raab, the former deputy PM, gives evidence to the Covid inquiry. 2.15pm: Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, gives evidence to the Commons Treasury committee about the autumn statement. Also today Steve Barclay, the environment secretary, is announcing plans to designate a new national park, as part of the government’s response to the Glover review of national parks.

       "     'bodyText': 'Michael Gove has apologised for mistakes made by the government during the Covid pandemic, saying the UK was too slow to lock down in early 2020 and then again that autumn. Dominic Cummings joked in a private message about taking his family to the countryside in March 2020, about a fortnight before he infamously did just that in apparent breach of lockdown laws. Rishi Sunak cancelled a meeting with his Greek counterpart for going back on assurances that he would not use a UK visit as a “public platform” to lobby for the return of the Parthenon sculptures to Athens, Downing Street has said. Workers in some public sector jobs will be completely prevented from striking under restrictive rules that may breach international law, parliament’s watchdog on human rights has said. The former boss of Wilko has tearfully told MPs she was devastated by the collapse of the budget retailer as she claimed the family’s multimillion-pound fortune was not enough to rescue it. In the Commons, in response to the urgent question on migration figures, Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, was asked when the government’s plan to cut immigration would be announced. He replied: My plan would have been brought to the House before last Christmas if I could have done. It has been reported that Jenrick has his own plan which he has presented to No 10. Asked if Jenrick’s comment meant No 10 had blocked a plan he had proposed, a No 10 spokesperson told the afternoon lobby briefing: I don’t know what specifically he is referring to. It’s not unusual for policy to be discussed in the normal way between departments, I’m sure this was no different. O’Connor asks about another statement by Harries at a press conference in March 2020. She was asked about the WHO advocating widespread testing, and she implied that was not advice that covered the UK. Harries says her statement was misinterpreted. Many countries had not found any Covid cases, and that is why the WHO was encouraging them to test. She backed that, she says. But, she says, the problem in the UK was that they had been testing, and that they were running out of tests. O’Connor is now asking Harries to defend a statement she made at a press conference in April 2020 saying the UK was an international exemplar in terms of pandemic preparedness. Harries defends the statement, saying she was referring to a previous assessment of the UK’s position. She says when she said “regardless of the position we may be in now”, she was acknowledging that things had changed. O’Connor says that, at a press conference in March 2020, Harries said that the problems with PPE had been sorted out. He asks her to accept this was wrong. Harries says she was not responsible for PPE. She says, at the press conferences, she had to rely on what she had been told. She says she apologised for getting that wrong when she next attended a press conference. To apologise like that was unusual, she says. At the Covid inquiry Prof Dame Jenny Harries, the chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, is being questioned by Andrew O’Connor, counsel for the inquiry. O’Connor puts it to Harries that, as the pandemic was taking off, she was one of the scientists who argued the case that it would be a mistake to introduce lockdown measures too early because people would get tired of complying. He says Prof Sir Chris Whitty has accepted that he was wrong in what he said about this, and he asks Harries why she has not accepted that she was at fault. Harries is reluctant to accept that she was wrong in what she said. But eventually she said, if she “miscommunicated”, that would be an opportunity to learn. Before he finished giving evidence, Michael Gove was questioned by Danny Friedman KC, counsel for four organisations representing disabled people. Friedman asked Gove about a government document saying the Covid-O committee had agreed on 29 October 2020 to work on measures to protect people who were disproportionately at risk because of their ethnicity. The minute also says Boris Johnson had asked officials to prepare “in slower time” a more ambitious package to protect people with disabilities. Friedman asked Gove to explain why disabled people were deemed a lower priority. Gove said he thought the phrase “in slower time” referred to the fact that preparing those measures was going to take more time. He said this does not mean the disabled were a lower priority. People involved in the decision making did not feel like that, he said. David Cameron is in Brussels for his first big meeting in the city since losing his premiership over Brexit in 2016. The new foreign secretary was in the EU capital for a summit of Nato foreign ministers but snuck into the HQ after most of the cameras and British press had disappeared. However, he did join other foreign ministers for the traditional “family photo”. He will be in Brussels for a second day of the Nato meeting tomorrow. Michael Gove has now finished his evidence. Just before he left, Lady Hallett, the inquiry chair, said she wanted to respond to something Gove said earlier and she said he was wrong to suggest the line of questioning from Hugo Keith KC, lead counsel to the inquiry, gave some indication as to what her conclusions would be. She said: I don’t have any settled views as yet … I will not reach any conclusion until I have considered all the evidence. She said she would be considering all the evidence, and that what came out in the oral hearings was only part of that. She would not just be focusing on WhatsApp messages, she said. She said counsel was not putting forward personal views. If questions implied a personal view, that was only because they were designed to “test the evidence robustly”, she said. And she said that, even if counsel had a view, that would not be relevant because the inquiry’s conclusions would reflect what she decided. Gove welcomed the clarification. Mitchell also showed the inquiry an extract from an expert analysis submitted to the inquiry, compiled by Ailsa Henderson, assessing the speeches given by UK ministers in 2020. She says there was “little attempt” to explain when rules applied across the whole of the UK and when they were England-only. Gove does not accept this was a significant problem. He claims people had a “pretty clear understanding” of the different responsibilities of the different governments. And he says if the complaint just consists of “someone mixing up the phrase English and British” at certain points, that does not really prove that the UK government was being high-handed. At the inquiry Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary and former Cabinet Office minister, is being questioned by Claire Mitchell KC on behalf of Scottish Covid Bereaved. Mitchell says Gove accused the SNP government earlier of trying to exploit Covid at certain points for party political purposes. But she brings up a document written by Gove’s team in the Cabinet Office which talks about highlighting the benefits of the union. She suggests this shows it was the UK government that was trying to politicise the crisis. Gove rejects this. He says he just wanted to stress the facts. He says it was a fact that furlough was generous, a fact that the devolved administrations got extra money via the Barnett formula and a fact that the vaccine rollout was more effective because it was UK-wide. Dominic Cummings joked in a private message about taking his family to the countryside in March 2020, about a fortnight before he infamously did just that in apparent breach of lockdown laws, Peter Walker reports. The message was presented at the inquiry earlier (see 12pm), but this particular message was not singled out for comment. Here is Peter’s story. Back at the Covid inquiry, Michael Gove is now being questioned by Kirsten Heaven, counsel for Covid Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru. Heaven asks about a comment from Boris Johnson in his witness statement where Johnson said it was “optically wrong” for the PM to be meeting the first ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as if they were equals. Gove says Johnson was not just arguing that it was optically wrong. He says Johnson had a more fundamental objection to decisions being taken like that. Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, told MPs earlier that the government would bring in “a serious package of fundamental reforms” to bring down immigration. He made the comment as he responded to an urgent question tabled by Labour about last week’s migration figures. During the UQ, in which Jenrick faced fierce criticism from some Tory MPs over the level of net migration, the minister said: We believe that the number of people coming into this country is too high, that it is placing unbearable pressure on our public services and on housing, that it is making it impossible to integrate people into this country and is harming community cohesion and national unity. It is also a moral failure because it’s leaving people on welfare and enabling companies to reach all too often for the easy lever of foreign labour. For all those reasons, we are determined to tackle this issue. We understand the concerns of the British public and I’m here to say that we share them, and that we are going to bring forward a serious package of fundamental reforms to address this issue once and for all. Asked if the government would a cap on overall migration numbers, Jenrick replied: There are definitely strong arguments for using caps, whether in general or on specific visas, but these are conversations that we need to conclude within government. And asked if the government intended to restrict the ability of people with visas to bring dependants with them, Jenrick confirmed this was being considered. He said: It’s certainly true that there has been a very, very substantial number of dependants coming into the UK alongside visa holders, whether that be students, care workers or skilled workers, and it is a choice for the country as to whether we want to continue to pursue that. There is a strong argument for saying that it is unsustainable for the country to continue to take so many dependants who, in turn, put pressure on housing, public services, school places and so on. And there are different models on which we could base our visa system which did not enable so many dependants to come into the country. Jenrick said this was a particular issue for people coming to the UK with care worker visas. They were bringing dependants with them “almost one-for-one”, he said. Keith says on 2 January 2021 Gove sent a private note to Boris Johnson saying he should adopt a position of maximum suppression. Q: Why did you feel the need to write to Johnson like this? Gove says he wanted to make sure that he could put his views to Johnson direct, and without any interference. Q: You were chair of Covid-O (the committee dealing with Covid operational matters). You were a member of the Quad (the four ministers most in charge of this: Johnson, Rishi Sunak, Matt Hancock and Gove). Why did you need to do this? Gove says he wanted to use all means possible to get his views across. He says Keith criticised him earlier for not putting his views more robustly. (See 12.33pm.) Q: You wanted the last word. Yes, says Gove. Q: Why, on 20 March 2020, when the same debate was taking place, didn’t you do the same thing. Instead on 20 March you took the consensus approach. Gove says he could have been more “vehement” in March. But he was forceful at the time too, he says. Other people would agree, he says. Keith has now finished his questions. The inquiry is taking a short break, and it will be back at 3pm, when counsel for core participants will question Gove. Keith says in October it was argued that an early lockdown might cause less economic damage than a late one. In March that argument was not made, he says. Gove accepts that. But he says, as someone arguing for the second lockdown, he had to make the case with vigour. Keith says the Patrick Vallance diary entries show that Gove was very sceptical about the tier system. But he says the diary entries do not show Gove arguing for a second lockdown in the weeks before it was ordered in the autumn of 2020. Gove says anyone who heard his criticism of the tier system then in place would have realised he wanted something stronger. Keith is now in a stand-off with Gove. He is trying to get Gove to give a short answer to a question about why departments failed to respond adequately to a request he made. Gove says it is impossible to answer briefly, because he has to explain the political context. Keith tries again to get him to respond succinctly, but Gove claims he can either answer accurately, or briefly, but not both. Keith suggests that is one of the more unusual in terrorem threats he’s heard in his time. Gove says it’s a promise, not a threat. There has been quite a lot of this all day. Gove has been one of the more combative witnesses to appear recently – with his politeness failing to conceal his passive aggression. Back at the inquiry, Michael Gove admits the decision to change the UK government’s official advice from “stay at home” to “stay alert” was not communicated to the Scottish government first. Asked why that was, Gove says the UK government discussed many things with the Scottish government. But he goes on to say that the Scottish government was led by a party (the SNP) that sometimes has a desire to exploit grievances against the Westminster government. The SNP is also tempted “to exaggerate the impact of a mistake or an error in order to feed a broader political mission”. Hugo Keith KC, counsel for the inquiry, says the heads of the devolved governments, in their witness statements to the inquiry, have denied acting from “venal political motives” during Covid. Gove says in Wales and Northern Ireland the first minister was from a unionist party. But the SNP is different, he says, because it wants to leave the UK. Greek officials who travelled with Kyriakos Mitsotakis to London have vigorously denied any suggestion that a pledge had been made to eschew the contentious cultural issue of the Parthenon marbles during Tuesday’s aborted meeting with Rishi Sunak. “We have many topics to discuss,” said Tassos Hatzivasileou, a New Democracy MP, clarifying that the Parthenon sculptures were one of many topics the Greek contingent had planned to raise in talks with the British prime minister. He went on: The agenda was not a single-issue one, nor is it going to be. But unfortunately what are the British doing? They, alone, are politicising the whole affair. Hatzivasileou, who advises the Greek leader on international affairs and was part of the visiting team, downplayed the role of the UK government in ongoing negotiations over the antiquities, saying Athens’ counterpart in the discussions was the British Museum, home of the “exiled” artworks for the past two centuries, not Downing Street. He said: Sunak’s choice to cancel the meeting essentially politicises the whole process which only indirectly concerns the British government. The prime minister [Mitsotakis] did not say anything new [in his Sunday interview with the BBC]. He repeated, yet again, and very clearly, well-known Greek views regarding reunification of the Parthenon sculptures. It was evident, he said, that Sunak was acting under pressure from public opinion polls ahead of general elections in the UK next year. 2024 is a year of elections in the UK and the pressure of polls showing the Labour party ahead with 20 percentage points obviously pushed the British side into making this diplomatic foul ... but it is a pity because our relations with the British are far-reaching. We have a strong friendship with a strategic base. Keith told the inquiry that there was a specific WhatsApp group set up to discuss the hunting and shooting issues. As well as Gove, its members included Simon Hart (now chief whip, Welsh secretary at the time, and a former chief executive of the Countryside Alliance), Mark Spencer (chief whip at the time, and a farmer), Nigel Adams (a Foreign Office minister at the time, and a close ally of Boris Johnson’s) and Alistair Jack (Scottish secretary then and now). Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary and former Cabinet Office minister, is back at the Covid inquiry. Hugo Keith KC, counsel for the inquiry, asks about a decision taken in the autumn of 2020 to exempt hunting and shooting from Covid restrictions. He shows WhatsApp exchanges referring to them. In a message on 12 September 2020, an official (not named) puts it to Gove that he assumes Gove is “strongly in favour of exempting [hunting and shooting] but in a way that doesn’t appear on face of regs [regulations]”. Gove replies: “Yes.” Asked about the exchanges, Gove rejects suggestions that he was trying to conceal the fact that he was making an exemption for the two sports (which are popular with some Tory supporters). Gove claimed he was just trying to ensure that the rules were applied in a consistent manner. A Greek minister has said that Rishi Sunak’s decision to snub Kyriakos Mitsotakis was “a bad day” for relations between the two countries. In an interview with Radio 4’s World at One, Adonis Georgiadis, the Greek development minister, said: It was a bad day. I think your prime minister, when he will have a second thought, he will understand that the Greek prime minister is an important person. The Greek people have re-elected him and put their trust in him. I have to be very honest — what Kyriakos Mitsotakis mentioned in his interview is not just his own opinion. It is the single one opinion of 11 million Greek people and I think many more million people around the world. Downing Street has defended Rishi Sunak’s decision to cancel a meeting with his Greek counterpart, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, after Mitsotakis made the case for the Parthenon marbles to be returned to Athens on the BBC on Sunday. Asked to explain Sunak’s decision, the PM’s spokesperson told journalists at the lobby briefing this morning: The UK and Greece relationship is hugely important, from our work together in Nato, to tackling shared challenges like illegal migration and joint efforts to resolve the crisis in the Middle East and the war in Ukraine. When requesting a meeting with the prime minister this week, the Greek government provided reassurances that they would not use the visit as a public platform to relitigate long-settled matters relating to the ownership of the Parthenon sculptures, which would only serve to distract from those important issues I just outlined. Given those assurances were not adhered to, the prime minister felt it would not be productive to hold a meeting dominated by that issue, rather than the important challenges facing Greek and British people. The deputy prime minister was available to meet the Greek prime minister to discuss the wider topics and we are disappointed the prime minister opted not to take this meeting. The Covid inquiry has stopped for lunch. It will be back at 1.35pm. Lady Hallett, the chair, says the lunch break is a bit shorter than usual today because they have so much evidence to get through. Back at the Covid inquiry, Hugo Keith KC, counsel for the inquiry, asks Michael Gove if he agrees with Helen MacNamara, the deputy cabinet secretary, that having the Covid-S and Covid-O committees dealing with Covid meant that too few people were involved in the key decisions. Gove says he does not accept that. He says the full cabinet is too unwieldy to take proper decisions. Teaching unions have reacted with anger after the education secretary, Gillian Keegan, announced plans to introduce minimum service levels (MSLs) in schools to protect children in the case of strike action. She launched a consultation on the new proposals today after talks with unions to draw up a voluntary agreement collapsed. It includes plans to prioritise attendance for vulnerable children, exam groups, children of critical workers and primary school pupils, as well as the use of rotas for strikes lasting five days or more. Keegan said: Keeping children in school is my number one priority. Last year’s school strikes were some of the most disruptive on record for children and parents with 25 million cumulative days lost, alongside the strike action that badly affected students in colleges and universities. We cannot afford a repeat of that disruption - particularly as young people continue to catch up from the pandemic. Whilst I know many schools and colleges worked really hard to keep children and young people in face-to-face education during strikes, we must make sure that approach is applied in every school, in every area of country. Unions were unanimous in their opposition. Patrick Roach, the general secretary of the NASUWT teachers union, accused the government of trying to bully teachers into silence. He said: The government is once again demonstrating its contempt for teachers, at a time when they should be listening to the concerns of the profession and facing up to the crisis in recruitment and retention they have created. Daniel Kebede, the general secretary of the National Education Union, added: This is a fundamental attack on the democratic freedoms and rights of school staff. It also demonstrates the government’s incredible lack of understanding that schools already ensure is in place for students on strike days. And Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: Minimum service levels are a profoundly illiberal policy by a government that has lost the argument. Nobody wants to go on strike. It is action that is taken as a last resort when all else has failed. But passing a law which effectively removes the right to strike from groups of employees is obviously done in order to weaken unions and the voice of employees over their pay and conditions. Q: Why did you not call for lockdown in the Cobra meetings you attended in the week starting 16 March? Gove says he believes he had communicated his views. Sometimes as a minister, when chairing a meeting, you have to act as a neutral chair. He says he was asked by a PM to chair a Cobra meeting then, and he felt he ought to be neutral. Q: Do you regret not being more forthright? Gove says normally people are not happy when he is forthright. But he accepts on this occasion he should have been. Gove says he also read articles about the case against lockdown. But he says the Swedish approach to Covid was more similar to the UK’s than some people claimed, because people there voluntarily restricted their social contacts even though legal restrictions were not in force as they were in the UK. Keith says the decision to order people to stay at home on 16 March 2020 had a considerable impact on people’s behaviour. Q: Why did you not wait until there was a bit more data before going ahead with the full lockdown? Because the virus was spreading exponentially, Gove says. Keith says ministers knew the virus was spreading exponentially earlier in March. Gove says he personally was pressing for the most vigorous action earlier. Q: Would you have backed a lockdown on 16 or 20 March? Yes, says Gove. He says this article, by Tomas Pueyo, had a decisive impact on this thinking. Keith puts it to Gove that Johnson was not just someone who liked testing both sides of an argument before taking a decision. He puts it to Gove that Johnson was someone reluctant to take a decision, or unwilling to stick to a decision he had taken. Gove says he does not accept that, at least in this case. He says Johnson was entitled to test the arguments. Johnson ended up taking the right decision, he says. But he accepts it may have taken Johnson “a little longer, to come to that conclusion than others”. Q: Dominic Cummings says, in the week starting Monday 16 March (the day Boris Johnson told people to stay at home), the PM was oscillating as to whether further measures were required. Gove says this was difficult. He claims Johnson did not find taking decisions difficult. But he says he was a liberal, and found the idea of restricting free association deeply difficult. It was opposed to his world view. To contemplate such a big measure was a decision of huge weight, he says. Gove says his personal view was that such a decision was inevitable. But he says Johnson would instinctively have felt unhappy with all these decisions, including closing schools. As for Johnson’s oscillating style, he says Johnson liked to hear the thesis and then the antithesis before taking a decision. He goes on: He preferred gladiatorial decision-making rather than inquisitorial. He wanted to see the two cases or the three cases rehearsed in front of him, or even rehearsed in his own mind. Any prime minister is entitled to test propositions and to think ‘is the restriction of liberty and the economic damage consequent upon lockdown worth inflicting on people in order to prevent the spread of this virus’? Gove says some people found this approach difficult. But he says he was used to Johnson being like this. He says all leaders have their own ways of taking decisions. Keith shows Gove an extract from an exchange of messages between Gove and Dominic Cummings. On 4 March 2020 Gove told Cummings that the government was “fucking up” and that the situation was worse than he thought. Gove said: You know me, I don’t often kick off but we’re fucking up as a government and missing golden opportunities. I will carry on doing what I can but the whole situation is even worse than you think and action needs to be taken or we will regret it for a long time. Gove says he was concerned about the ability of the government to deliver. Covid was on my mind, but it wasn’t the principal thing that I was messaging about. It was about the Cabinet Office overall, including its ability to deal with Covid. He apologises for his language. This set of exchanges, shown to the inquiry, also shows Cummings saying to Gove in a message on 11 March 2020 that “people should be shot” because government handling of the crisis was so bad. Keith asks why the government did not realise in early March that it needed to stop the spread of Covid. Gove says ministers accepted the view of Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, that there was a limit to what could be done. Lockdown measures were unprecedented. And the argument was that, if they were introduced too early, they would have to be lifted because people would not put up with them for too long. The Covid inquiry has resumed. Hugo Keith KC, counsel for the inquiry, starts by saying, when Michel Gove told the inquiry earlier that the goverment made mistakes during Covid, he did not ask Gove to say what those errors were. He invites Gove to do so now. Gove says: I believe that we were too slow to lockdown initially in March (2020). I believe we should have taken stricter measures before we eventually decided to do so in late October. I believe that while it was admirable that we succeeded in building testing capacity so quickly, that the strategic approach to who should be tested, why and what our tests were for was not as rigorously thought through as it might have been. I am also concerned that we did not pay enough attention to the impact on children, vulnerable children, of some of the measures that we took. And he says the government’s approach to PPE procurement “deserves at the very least reflection”. Gove has a particular interest in this last issue because he has been interviewed by the National Crime Agency – as a witness, not as a suspect – in connection with the allegations about the Tory peer Michelle Mone and PPE procurement. Zac Goldsmith, who resigned as a Foreign Office minister in protest over Rishi Sunak’s lack of support on environmental issues, has accused the PM of embarrassing Britain on the world stage by cancelling his meeting with his Greek counterpart. This wasn’t the first time Sunak has snubbed a world leader, Goldsmith claimed. In a post on X, he said: Cancelling meetings at the last minute with leaders of allied countries is not only petulant and embarrassing, it reflects so badly on our country. ]The Greek PM was literally just restating longstanding Greek policy. It should be possible to agree or disagree without insulting him and his country. As a Foreign Office minister I was often baffled by Sunak’s clumsiness and sometimes rudeness This morning the Greek government’s spokesperson described Rishi Suank’s snub of Kyriakos Mitsotakis as “unprecedented”, with senior officials saying Sunak’s cancellation of the scheduled meeting was tantamount to an own goal. “We’re talking about a British foul,” said Dimitris Tsiodras who heads the prime ministerial press office. He told Mega TV: Greece is a proud country, with a long history. Mitsotakis represents this country, this people. You can’t just say: ‘Look, the meeting isn’t going to happen. See the deputy PM’. There was no question that Mitsotakis, who has made the marbles repatriation a government priority, would not raise the issue during his visit to London, Tsiodras said. He went on: The prime minister raises the issue of the marbles’ return at every opportunity, he has raised it in the past, and he raised it on Sunday … it is a well-known Greek position which he has expressed with great clarity … we were clear that the issue of the sculptures would be raised [in talks with Sunak]. In the wake of what Athens has called unseemly behaviour on the part of Sunak, Tsiodras said it was clear the country’s renewed campaign to win back the sculptures had gained momentum and was paying off. He explained: British public opinion has begun to firmly change [in favour of their return to Athens from the British Museum]. Obviously this has annoyed Sunak because when you have a difference of opinion it doesn’t mean you don’t go ahead with a meeting. You have the meeting and exchange opposing views. Meanwhile the Greek government spokesperson Pavlos Marinakis told Skai TV that while Athens’ centre-right administration did not want to further inflame the issue, Sunak’s snub would not be forgotten. He said: It is without precedent that a meeting doesn’t happen because of a difference [in opinion]. We don’t want to give the issue further credence … negotiation around the Parthenon marbles is not happening between Greece and the British state but with the British Museum and as such we don’t want it to be seen as a general crisis [in bilateral ties] but … as the negative behaviour of an individual, the British prime minister, about which we have expressed our displeasure. Keith quotes evidence showing that, in late February, Boris Johnson thought the biggest danger was over-reacting to Covid. Gove says by early March he thought the biggest danger was under-reacting. But Johnson was worried about paralysing the economy, he says. He says he wanted to be “absolutely certain it was justified” before taking such a step. Gove says at the end of February he could give “considerable weight” to what Gove was thinking. He goes on: It was only in the succeeding days that I became more and more convinced actually that action was required. And that was partly because of what I had seen happening in Italy, partly also material that had been sent to me by friends outside government that led me to believe action was needed. The hearing has now stopped for a break until 11.30am. Keith asks Gove about the plan for Covid in early 2020. Q: Was it just contain and delay? Partly, says Gove. But he says the fact that the chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, was a leading epidemiologist was an important help too. And the NHS had stocks of some drugs that might be useful, and PPE. Q: What debate was there about the need for infection control measures in early February? Gove says there was a debate about what was happening in Asian countries, including China. For the UK, lockdown was “an unprecedented departure”, he says. Normally those infected would be isolated – not the whole population. He says the government was looking at the emerging evidence. In early March, the advice was that a lockdown-type policy would have to be introduced with care because the population would not put up with it for long. Q: So do you accept that, as you debated the possibility of the virus spreading, there was no discussion of infection control? So how were you going to stop the virus spreading? Gove says he is sure that debate was going on in Sage. He could only rely on the advice given to ministers, and what he read in open source publications. At the time there were not many voices calling for a lockdown. It was only when Italy tried that approach that thinking changed. He says he searched “in vain” for people well in advance of early March were clear about what was needed. He says Rory Stewart, the former Tory cabinet minister, was one of the most prescient figures. Q: Was trust in the UK’s ability to cope with a pandemic misplaced? Gove says the UK was not as well placed as it might have been. He says the virus was novel. And he says there is “a significant body of judgment that believes that the virus itself was man-made”. He is referring to the claim that it was manufactured in a Chinese government laboratory. He is suggesting that this might have been something that made the virus particularly hard to deal with. But it is quite a tangent he has gone down, and it may go further than what ministers have said before about the credibility of the China “laboratory escape” thesis. Keith quickly closes down this line of argument, saying that “divisive issue” does not fall within the terms of reference of the inquiry. UPDATE: After Keith said this issue was ouside the scope of the inquiry, Gove said: I think it is important to recognise that the virus presented a series of new challenges that required both the science to adjust and science , by definition, adjusts on the basis of accumulating evidence – both about the operation of the virus and its effect on particular elements within the population. Keith suggests, if DHSC was struggling to cope, it should have asked for help earlier. Gove says it was not just the DHSC that had data about the crisis. Others in government should have been in a position to assess the problem, he suggests. Keith is now asking about Matt Hancock and the Department of Health and Social Care. Q: We have heard evidence that between February and May 2020 the DHSC was overwhelmed by the crisis. Do you agree? Gove says he would put it differently. He says he has a very high opinion of Sir Chris Wormald, the permanent secretary at DHSC. They worked together at education, he says. And he says he also has a high opinion of Hancock. But “too much was asked of DHSC at that point”, he says. He says they should have realised collectively that this was a “whole-system crisis”. He says DHSC thought they could handle the crisis. While that spirit was admirable, it would have been better to broaden responsibility earlier, he says. UPDATE: Gove said: I have a high opinion of Matt Hancock as a minister. However, I believe that too much was asked of DHSC (Department of Health and Social Care) at that point. We should collectively have recognised that this was a health system crisis at an earlier point and taken on to other parts of government the responsibility for delivery that was being asked of DHSC at the time. Keith asks about the comments from Simon Case in WhatsApp exchanges saying he had never seen such a team ill-suited to running the country. Gove says all Downing Street teams involve people who clash. Under Boris Johnson there were strong personalities in No 10, he says. But those strong personalities had not just delivered an election victory; they had broken the logjam over Brexit. Q: But do you accept those strong personalities had an impact on how No 10 performed. Gove says you will never get a team “in perfect harmony”. It is in the nature of politics to have strong views. The question is, does the system tolerate a diversity of views? And does it deliver when a decision has been taken. (These questions are mostly about Dominic Cummings. Cummings used to work as an adviser for Gove when Gove was education secretary, and for a long time they were close friends.) Gove says he shares some of Cummings’ concerns about the weaknesses in the way government operates. But he goes on: But I think that it’s in the nature of anyone who’s a reformer that they will feel the need to test the effectiveness of delivery, and then want to seek to improve it. He says the Johnson government delivered Brexit well, and delivered the vaccine rollout well. But in other areas “it would be wrong to award ourselves high marks”, he says. UPDATE: Gove said: It is certainly the case that under Boris Johnson there were strong personalities in No 10. You’re never going to get a perfect team of personalities, all of whom are beautifully aligned and amongst whom there is perfect harmony. You will always have – it’s in the nature of politics – strong views, sometimes punchily expressed. The nature of decision-making in any organisation under pressure means that people do sometimes need to be a little bit direct. As an example of how dysfunctional the Cabinet Office was, Michael Gove recalls being asked to make a Commons statement about the departure of the permanent secretary at the Home Office, Philip Rutnam, after a row with Priti Patel, the home secretary. He says that he was only told just before he went into the Commons that Patel was being investigated over an alleged breach of the ministerial code in relation to this. The Cabinet Office’s propriety and ethics team were involved in this, he says. But he says he had not been told. Gove breaks away from the line of questioning to issue an apology. I want to take this opportunity, if I may, to apologise to the victims who endured so much pain, the families who’ve endured so much loss, as a result of the mistakes that were made by government in response to the pandemic. And as a minister, responsible for the Cabinet Office, and who was also close to many of the decisions that were made, I must take my share of responsibility for that. Politicians are human beings, we’re fallible, we make mistakes and we make errors. And I’m sure that the inquiry will have an opportunity to look in detail at many of the errors I and others made. But he also says he and his colleagues were trying to take the best decisions “in circumstances where every decision was difficult and every course was bad”. Keith says the inquiry has heard from several witnesses who have described the Cabinet Office as dysfunctional during Covid. Q: How did that happen? Gove says the structure of the Cabinet Office was flawed. Normally a cabinet minister is responsible for what their department does. But that is not the case at the Cabinet Office, he says. Significant parts answer either to the cabinet secretary or to the PM, and not to the lead departmental minister, he says. Q: So to whom should the inquiry look for accountability as to the state the Cabinet Office was in? Gove says for many years the Cabinet Office has operated in a way which is “not as effective as it should be”, both in relation to delivering normal government services and and to responding to emergencies. He says the Cabinet Office ceded too much responsibility to lead government departments, and did not take enough responsibility at the centre. He also says past prime ministers have given the Cabinet Office responsibility for things that did not fit elsewhere, like drugs policy. He says it became a “Mary Poppins bag” into which PMs will shove things that need to be dealt with by the government’s nanny. He says, when he became responsible for the Cabinet Office in early 2020, he called for changes to the way it operated. He says he is not blaming the civil servants, some of whom were among the best. The problem was that it had been given too much to do, and that there was no strategic thinking about how the centre of government should be reconfigured. Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary and former Cabinet Office minister, has just started giving evidence to the Covid inquiry. He is being questioned by Hugo Keith KC, lead counsel for the inquiry. The feed is here: The FT’s George Parker says some Tories think Rishi Sunak cancelled his meeting with Kyriakos Mitsotakis because Mitsotakis met Keir Starmer first. Alex Norris, the shadow policing minsiter, told Sky News this mornng, that, if this was the reason for Sunak’s snub, that was extraordinary. he said: I thought the logic that we heard overnight that the prime minister didn’t want to discuss that topic, I thought that was pretty thin. If it’s about that, then I’d be very surprised indeed. Ultimately, Greece is a huge, important strategic ally of ours on the issue of migration, which of course Rishi Sunak talks about every day. Similarly on the economy, cultural issues, with lots of Greek people who live in this country and vice versa. So, of course he should be meeting with the prime minister when he’s in this country. I’m very, very surprised that he hasn’t. Here is Stephen Bush from the FT on the Parthenon marbles row. This whole argument is daft. No, it is not a gift to Labour that Rishi Sunak cancelled a meeting with the Greek PM. No, Labour has not fallen into a trap by criticising him either. Political debates by and for people who aren’t hit by rising interest rates or NHS waiting times. According to a report by Steven Swinford and Matt Dathan in the Times, Rishi Sunak has been told that, if he includes an option to disregard the European convention on human rights in the new legislation intended to ensure deportations to Rwanda can go ahead, that will be counterproductive – because it will delay the point at which flights might start. Swinford and Dathan say: The prime minister held talks on Saturday with James Cleverly, the home secretary; Alex Chalk, the justice secretary; and Victoria Prentis, the attorney general, about the plans for emergency legislation. Sunak is considering hardline plans to include a “notwithstanding” clause in the legislation to direct British courts to ignore the European convention on human rights (ECHR). However, legal advice drawn up for the meeting warned that this approach risked backfiring because it could lead to further challenges on the basis that Britain is breaching its ECHR obligations … Three senior government sources told the Times that No 10 is backtracking on opting out of the ECHR. One said: “Everyone wants whatever is going to work and that doesn’t seem to be the full-fat version. We’d be picking a fight when it’s not actually practically useful and we really just want what’s going to get planes off the ground the quickest.” Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the Greek PM, declined a meeting with the UK deputy prime minster, Oliver Dowden, after it was offered in place of one with Rishi Sunak, Ben Quinn reports. Here is some more polling on the Parthenon marbles from two years ago. Good morning. Rishi Sunak does not have all the qualities of a great human being but, among other virtues, he is generally calm and polite, and that makes his row with the Greek PM about the Parthenon marbles even harder to comprehend than it otherwise would be. The official explanation is that Sunak cancelled his meeting with Kyriakos Mitsotakis because Mitsotakis went back on a promise not to raise the issue of the sculptures during his three-day visit to the UK. But did anyone in No 10 seriously think that Mitsotakis would be able to get through media interviews without being asked about the subject? And so if the pretext for cancelling the meeting was flaky, was this all just some political ruse to present Sunak in a positive light ahead of the election. (One of the problems with political commentary at this stage of the political cycle is that it is assumed that everything is motivated by calculations about electoral positioning. Roughly 80% of the time that’s true, but sometimes it isn’t.) Some of the briefing from the Tory side backs up this analysis. Keir Starmer met Mitsotakis yesterday and Labour is not opposed to the marbles going back to Greece on loan, and in her London Playbook briefing Rosa Prince quotes a Conservative source as saying: Starmer sold out to secure a meeting. It’s naive on his part and shows how little regard he has for British taxpayers who have looked after these for generations. Starmer is up to his old tricks of just telling the person in front of him what they want to hear. Given that polling suggests two-thirds of Britons would support the sculptures going back to Greece as part of a deal that would see Greek artefacts being loaned to British museums in exchange, it is hard to see Sunak’s move as a great vote-winner. But James Johnson, a pollster who used to work in No 10 for Theresa May, says it is not obviously a mistake. He posted this on X last night. Perhaps the worst take on this whole affair came this morning from Mark Harper, the transport secretary. In an interview on Sky News this morning, he claimed that Sunak’s decision to cancel the meeting was not a snub. Asked if it was a snub, he replied: The prime minister wasn’t able to meet the Greek prime minister. He was offered a meeting with the deputy prime minister, which proved not to be possible for him to take up. So, I don’t think I’d characterise it the way you have. Discussions continue between our governments about important matters. Here is Helena Smith’s story about the row. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Rishi Sunak chairs cabinet. 10am: Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary and Cabinet Office minister during the pandemic, gives evidence to the Covid inquiry. Morning: David Cameron, the new foreign secretary, attends a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Brussels. 10.15am: Richard Hughes, chair of the Office for Budget Responsibility, and colleagues give evidence to the Commons Treasury committee about the autumn statement. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. After 12.30pm: MPs debate the second reading of the criminal justice bill. Afternoon: Prof Dame Jenny Harries, the chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, gives evidence to the Covid inquiry. If you want to contact me, do try the “send us a message” feature.

       "     'bodyText': 'Rishi Sunak kicked off his Prada loafers and sprawled out on the sofa. It had been another long day of everything going exactly to plan. The autumn statement in which taxes were going down while still going up. The net migration figures where getting tough on foreigners meant allowing more of them into the country. He couldn’t quite understand why people weren’t more grateful for everything he had done. A rare half hour with time to kill. Rish! reached for the laptop and began scrolling the Harrods website. He could do with a new suit. Tricky. He couldn’t decide on the fit. Was he a size 8- to 10-year-old? Or 10 to 12? One was too small with the trousers coming halfway up his legs, the other too large. Or were these emotional age groups? In which case he might be better off in the toddler range. Just as he was verifying his bank details – he’d tried waving his card vaguely at the laptop – there was a knock on the door. It was Oliver Dowden. Rish! smiled. He was glad of the interruption. He could do with some company. “Hi, Olive,” he said. “Good to see you Rishster,” the deputy prime minister replied. “What’s up?” “Err … like, it’s really heavy,” said Olive. “I think we might have an international incident on our hands. Like, the Greek prime minister, Zorba whatever his name is, is planning to use a few minutes of his hour-long chat with you to ask for the Elgin marbles back.” “No!” “Yes. The Greeks have only gone and decided that their decades-old policy of wanting the sculptures returned to the Parthenon is still their policy now. Can you believe it? What a bunch of shits.” Rish! stood up and paced the room. Now he was really fired up. This was an insult. Not just to the UK as a whole. But to him personally. The Greeks were going to try and embarrass him in public. Just imagine the shame! After a long conversation about immigration – the Greeks really needed to get their act together on that, it was a disgrace how many people were arriving there by boats – and a few pleasantries about Ukraine and Israel, there would be a harmless exchange in which Kyriakos Mitsotakis asked for the marbles and he said no. There was no place for that kind of adult diplomacy in his Tory government. What on earth would halfwits like Lee Anderson and Brendan Clarke-Smith say? “This just can’t happen, Olive,” said Rish!. He could feel another hissy fit coming on. Perhaps even a full-on temper tantrum. They were getting more and more frequent. “Quite right, Rishster,” Dowden shouted. “We can’t have the Greeks coming over here and walking all over us with their reasonableness. Hell, we didn’t leave the EU to have grownup international relations with our neighbours. Where was the fun in that? The whole point was to run down the economy and to make fun of foreigners. Putting the Little back into Great Britain. “What’s more, I’ve been disrespected,” Rish! pouted. “There is a pecking order in the list of global leaders and the Greek bloke is well below me. His country isn’t even in the G20. So he doesn’t get to decide what we talk about. I do. There’s only one thing for it. Cancel the meeting!” Sunak grabbed the phone and searched the contacts. G for Greek Man. He started texting. “Soz we now can’t meet. I’m decorating the Christmas tree. But you can’t have your fucking marbles. We stole them, so they are ours. Now run along. What bit of piss off don’t you get? PS: If you’re really desperate you can have a chat with Olive instead.” Within seconds there was a reply. “Have it your own way. It will be far easier to get the marbles back by talking to George Osborne at the British Museum. Or Lord Big Dave. Neither gives a fuck whether they stay in the UK. And if it’s OK, I’ll pass on seeing Olive. He’s even more useless than you. K” Olive and Rish! high-fived each other and celebrated with a Diet Coke. This was more like it. Living on the edge. Just watch the whole of the UK congratulate them on their tough negotiations. They weren’t going to be pushed around. Oh no. Tough on foreigners. Tough on the causes of foreigners. An hour later, an anxious looking Jeremy Hunt barged in. Had they heard? The Greek prime minister had driven a JCB down the A303 and dug up Stonehenge. And was now in the process of loading it on to a plane at Stansted. Something had to be done. “There’s only one thing for it,” Rish! declared. “We’ll have to declare war on Greece. Call Grant Shapps at defence and get him to send our aircraft carrier to the Aegean. And we’ll need the SAS.” Olive could barely contain his priapism. He had been gagging for a good war. The excitement of his own self-importance. It was worth other people dying for this. The Tory right would be thrilled. As would the whole country. Rejoice! Rejoice! This could change the whole election. “Right, chaps,” squeaked Olive. ‘We’re going into Corfu. They play cricket already so they must subconsciously want to be invaded by us.” “OK,” said Rish!, putting on the combat jersey President Zelenskiy had given him. “While we’re about it, let’s also go to war with Spain. Time to make Gibraltar British.” “Umm,” mumbled Jezza. “It already is British.” “You’re kidding! Well, let’s invade it anyway. Just to make sure.” Just then the phone rang. It was Javier Milei in Argentina. He was taking back the Falklands and installing Liz Truss as governor. “Cut our one aircraft carrier in half.” Rish! ordered. “And send the stern to the South Atlantic.

       "     'bodyText': 'You’d need to have a heart of stone not to feel a sliver of compassion for the home secretary. Just a fortnight ago James Cleverly was living his best life. Flying around the world by private jet – or, if he had to slum it, business class – in search of photos of himself with world leaders in his capacity as foreign secretary. Keepsakes to boast to the kids about when he was out of a job in a year’s time. It was the ideal job. Because literally all that was expected of him was to be able to smile and not be rude to anyone. There was no pressure on him to resolve any of the world’s crisis points, because that was never part of the job description. Neither Israel nor Hamas wait to take their cues from the UK. Likewise Russia and Ukraine. We’re just global window dressing. Our foreign policy goals are simple. To make us feel better about ourselves internationally. Safe in the knowledge that no one else is watching. Or cares that much. So as long as Cleverly could articulate the words “we have to achieve a peaceful two-state solution”, he was a stunning success. With time, you could have probably trained my dog to be foreign secretary. Now, though, Cleverly is in the eye of the storm. Jimmy Dimly isn’t the brightest of cabinet ministers – who is? – but even he can work out he’s been chucked a hospital pass. First with the Rwanda policy that the supreme court has all but killed off. A policy that he himself had described as batshit. Then with the immigration figures that showed that nearly three-quarters of a million more people came to the UK last year, almost all of them legally. And here again he was left to take the hit from the right wing of his party who would rather the NHS and social care services fall apart than be staffed by foreigners. So it was a defensive-looking Jimmy D who turned up in the Commons for his first Home Office departmental questions. As he took his seat, his eyes darted to the opposition and government benches. As if trying to check out from where any likely trouble would come. Wondering also if it might come from his own immigration minister. A rather bigger fan of the Rwanda scheme Fortunately, Robert Jenrick was on his best behaviour. Honest Bob is another Tory minister who has been on quite the journey. Back in 2014 when he was first elected in a byelection, Honest Bob was a true Cameroon. Anything Big Dave said or thought. That’s what Honest Bob said and thought. He wouldn’t have dreamed of supporting Rwanda. But to Honest Bob the career has been everything. He has never had any beliefs to believe in. Along with helping out the Tory donor and pornographer Richard “Dirty” Desmond with planning permission, he’s just done anything to advance himself. He will say whatever he thinks the boss class wants him to say. Rwanda was never a matter of principle. Just a quick sadistic thrill allied to a job in the cabinet. The unpleasantness is just a gratuitous add-on. So when Tory James Morris understandably inquired what the government policy on Rwanda now was – under Suella it had been the end goal, for Cleverly it was apparently “just one of several ideas” – Honest Bob declined to break ranks. That might have required a sense of self-worth. Of personal credibility. Instead, he just said what was easiest. That when he had previously insisted that Rwanda was the linchpin of the government’s illegal migration policy, what he had always meant was that it was actually neither here nor there. In the greater scheme of things it was largely immaterial. A Freudian slip. Not least because it’s never going to happen. Thereafter it was left to Jimmy D to do the heavy lifting on the supreme court judgment. The delusional Miriam Cates along with Jack Brereton and Simon Clarke wanted reassurances that reality could be whatever they wanted it to be. Could the government say that Rwanda didn’t kill refugees so the UK could then ignore all other international legal obligations? Dimly coughed politely. He hadn’t quite appreciated just how mad the Tories were. Nor did anyone seem to have considered that Rwanda might be unwilling to sign a treaty giving Britain the right to tell Rwanda what to do. Or that Rwanda might think the UK to be an unsafe country. For the rest of the session, Jimmy D got off quite lightly. No one on either side of the house wanted to raise the migration statistics. Yet again Brexit is the truth that cannot be told by Conservatives or Labour. Just as well, as no one in government has a clue what to do about migration. But Dimly wasn’t entirely done. He was back 45 minutes later to hear a point of order raised by Alex Cunningham. The Labour MP wanted an apology for Cleverly having told porkies. Rather than admitting he had called his Stockton constituency a “shithole”, he had tried to claim that what he had said was that Cunningham was a “shit MP”. Not the most convincing of explanations, as Cleverly had first denied he had said anything at all, and his subsequent elucidation bore no resemblance to the audio recording. Put simply, Dimly wasn’t entirely convincing. But he was only prepared to apologise for the things he hadn’t said. Or the things that he might have said if you hadn’t actually been able to hear him. It was the looking-glass world of Rwanda all over again. Cunningham umm-ed and ahh-ed. It was hard to accept an apology for something that hadn’t been said. He hadn’t taken enough acid for that. Dimly was now outraged. How dare anyone doubt his word. He would never say the things he had said. His self-importance has never been in greater evidence. All puffed up and no place to go. Was the Labour MP calling him a liar? Er, yes and no. Because obviously it is impossible for one MP to call another a liar. The deputy speaker intervened. Could they not pretend that the apology was just for saying the word “shit”? And pretend that inside Dimly was a foul-mouthed homunculus over whom Jimmy D had no control and who kept putting words into his mouth. It was a farce. Everyone knows exactly what was said. Yet again, parliament had fallen over itself to treat us all like mugs. A place where honour counts more than the truth. John Crace’s book Depraved New World (Guardian Faber, £16.99) is out now.

       "     'bodyText': 'Boris Johnson appeared to have no idea that Greater Manchester had spent months under tougher Covid restrictions than London, Andy Burnham has said, arguing that this exemplified an over-centralised approach to the pandemic. As Peter Walker reports, Giving evidence to the inquiry into Covid, Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, said he felt his region was given a “punishment beating” with less financial support after pushing back against regional restrictions. He also told the hearing that Matt Hancock, the health secretary at the time, decided to impose severe tier 3 restrictions on Greater Manchester in October 2020 despite believing the measures would be ineffective. Additional lives were lost during Covid because of “bad faith” by Boris Johnson’s government in excluding London’s representatives from early emergency meetings about the pandemic, denying ministers vital knowledge, Sadiq Khan, the city’s mayor, has said. Consultants in England have reached a deal with the government that could end strikes, the Department of Health and Social Care has said. James Cleverly, the home secretary, has refused to assure Tory MPs that the government’s new legislation on the Rwanda deportation policy will allow the European convention on human rights to be ignored. (See 3.20pm.) Rishi Sunak has said the UK will not return to the close relationship with China pursued under David Cameron, as the prime minister met business leaders in an effort to drum up foreign investment. Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, has said growth potential for the economy is lower than it has been for most of his working life (he joined the Bank in the mid 1980s). In an interview with the Chronicle in Newcastle, he said: It does concern me that the supply side of the economy has slowed. It does concern me a lot. If you look at what I call the potential growth rates of the economy, there’s no doubt it’s lower than it has been in much of my working life. Downing Street does not accept this analysis. At this afternoon’s lobby briefing for journalists, asked about what Bailey said, the PM’s spokesperson said the economy would continue “outperforming expectations”. He said: I think you heard from both the prime minister and the chancellor on the UK’s economic outlook. We do believe that we have turned a corner, particularly given the success in halving inflation. And you saw an autumn statement which was designed to boost the UK economy with new policies like full expensing, which was long called-for by businesses and we are confident that as a result we will keep outperforming expectations. In the Commons Alex Cunningham, the Labour MP for Stockton North, is asking a point of order about James Cleverly’s heckle directed at him last week during PMQs. He says Cleverly’s explanation, that he was calling Cunningham a “shit” MP, not Stockton a “shit-hole”, was untrue. Dame Eleanor Laing, the deputy speaker, objects to Cunningham saying that Cleverly said something that was not true. Cunningham says finding alternative wording will be a “challenge”, but he says Cleverly may have inadvertenly misled people. Laing says Cleverly is in the chamber, and she invites him to respond via his own point of order. Cleverly rises, and says he did not make derogatory remarks about Stockton. He says he did not, would not and would never say something like that. He says he did make a derogatory remark about Cunningham and has apologised for that. In response to heckling claiming that what he is saying is not true, he asks: “What are you saying, sir?” (He knows that the rules of debate do not allow MPs to call each other liars.) Cunningham rises again. He says he does not need an apology for an insult against him “because it didn’t happen”. And he says Cleverly has not even apologised directly to him, or to the people of his constituency. He says Cleverly has just apologised for using unparliamentary language. Laing says it is up to Cunningham whether he accepts the apology or not. But she required an apology for unparliamentary language, she says. UPDATE: Cleverly said: I know what I said. I rejected the accusation that I criticised his constituency. My criticism, which I made from a sedentary position, about the honourable gentleman used inappropriate language for which I apologise. But I will not accept that my criticism was of his constituency because it was not. In his evidence this afternoon Andy Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor, also referred to a minute from the government’s Covid-O committee, which was responsible for Covid operational matters. Burnham summarised it as proposing a “punishment beating for Greater Manchester”. He quoted a passage from the minute saying: Lancashire should have a lighter set of measures imposed than Greater Manchester since they had shown a greater willingness to co-operate. Tougher measures should be imposed on Greater Manchester that day. Burnham went on: Because we stood up for people in our city region who would otherwise have really struggled had they gone into that lockdown without the funds to help them, because we took that stand they decided to make an example of us. It’s unbelievable for me now to look at evidence saying they knew it didn’t work, they knew tier 3 didn’t work. They knew that, but they were still going to impose it on us without enough financial support. As PA Media reports, the tier system was introduced in October 2020 and imposed different restrictions on English regions in an effort to contain the spread of Covid-19. The system was, however, unable to stem infections and a month-long national lockdown was introduced in November 2020, followed by a stricter tier system in December. Burnham had argued that those unable to work because of regional restrictions should receive 80% of their salary under the furlough scheme, rather than the 67% suggested by the government, PA says. Burnham also told the inquiry that he thought it was “disgraceful” that the same Covid-O minutes described his own behaviour during his row with Westminster over the policy as “appalling”. Burnham said: I have seen that minute, the Covid-O minute, and frankly it’s nothing short of disgraceful, the points that were made in that minute. It wasn’t me that was behaving appallingly, it was the people in that room that were behaving appallingly because they were about to impose a policy on Greater Manchester which they knew didn’t work. And that’s something that I’ve only now realised looking at other people’s statements to this inquiry, and it makes me angry on behalf of the people of Greater Manchester that they sat in that room and they imposed a policy that they had been advised by Sage and others would not work. Matt Hancock knew tier 3 restrictions would not work when he imposed them on Greater Manchester, the Covid inquiry heard this afternoon. This came out during Andy Burnham’s evidence, when the Greater Manchester mayor quoted from the written statement to the inquiry given by Hancock, the former health secretary. Burnham said: [Hancock] says in his evidence about tier 3: ‘I was in despair that we had announced a policy that we knew would not work.’ In the Commons James Cleverly, the home secretary, also said he thought the police had got more robust in policing pro-Palestinian demonstrations and that that was welcome. In response to a question from Sir Desmond Swayne (Con), who asked what was being done to reassure Jewish people that they were safe in the UK, Cleverly replied: I have made it very, very clear to the police forces of the UK that when a minority group in this country tells us they are living in fear that we must take action. I’m pleased that the policing response this weekend was more robust than in previous weekends. The police are clearly listening to the conversations we are having with them and I commend them for doing so. Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, held a breakfast meeting this morning with 35 of the global business leaders and investors attending the government’s global investment summit. According to a press notice sent out by Labour, some of those present welcomed the party’s focus on growth. Labour said: Several attendees expressed their relief that economic growth has returned to the centre of the public debate and noted Labour’s role in bringing about that change, driven by the launch of its number one mission for government, to secure the highest sustained growth in the G7. In addressing the question of what was needed for the UK to be a more attractive destination for investment, the global business leaders and investors talked about the need for stability and certainty, the need for planning reform to speed up the delivery of infrastructure projects, the need for a less bureaucratic approach from Whitehall with clear political direction on priorities and the need to ensure access to talent with the skills businesses in the UK need. Several attendees also praised the engagement and welcomed Labour undertaking these conversations in opposition to ensure we were as prepared as possible. At the Covid inquiry Steve Rotheram, the mayor of Liverpool city region, is giving evidence now. He is being questioned by Joanne Cecil, counsel for the inquiry. Rotheram says in the first wave he was routinely given no advance warning by the UK government ahead of restrictions being introduced. James Cleverly, the home secretary, would not reveal the cost of the government’s appeal to the supreme court over its Rwanda policy in the Commons. In response to a question from the SNP’s Steven Bonnar on what the legal costs were, Cleverly replied: The funding of the Home Office will be reported in the usual and the appropriate way. I don’t have the figures to hand, but I will make sure the house will be updated of the costs. In the Commons Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, says Cleverly has made a series of errors in his first two weeks in post. She says he said the number of asylum seekers in hotels is down. But figures out four days ago showed them at a record high, at 56,000, she says. Cleverly says he has only been in the job for 14 days. He cannot solve all the problems immediately, he says (missing the point Cooper was making about a false claim). Cooper describes Cleverly as Colonel Calamity. Given his enthusiasm for profanities, she asks him to accept that he is “up a certain kind of creek without a paddle”. Cleverly says he admires Cooper, but she has failed to ask a sensible question. He says this shows Labour has nothing to say on immigration. Sir Simon Clarke, the former levelling up secretary, told Cleverly in the Commons that it was his “profound conviction” that, to be effective, the Rwanda legislation would have to allow the disapplication of parts of the European convention on human rights. Cleverly told Clarke he was making an “incredibly important point”, but he said he did not want to prejudge what would be in the bill. He said he wanted to do everything he could stop to break the business model used by people smugglers. Earlier he also refused to give two other Tory MPs the firm assurance they wanted on the ECHR. (See 3.14pm.) In the Commons James Cleverly, the home secretary, has now responded to questions about illegal migration. Two Conservatives, Miriam Cates and Jack Brereton, both asked for assurances that the bill being introduced to assure the courts that Rwanda is a safe country for deportations will be robust. Brereton asked for an assurance that all the necessary legal exemptions would be in place (referring to proposals that would allow the goverment to ignore the European convention on human rights). In response, Cleverly did not try telling either of them that the Rwanda policy was not the “be-all and end-all”. (See 2.57am.) But he was evasive about quite how robust the legislation would be. He said the bill would be designed to ensure flights to Rwanda could take off, and he said he would do all he could to drive down small boat arrivals. Coming back to Covid, this is from Prof Christina Pagel, head of the Clinical Operational Research Unit at University College London. She says Andy Burnham was right to say Covid cases were significantly higher in the north-west than in London as the first lockdown was eased. (See 2.34pm.) Turning away from the Covid inquiry for a moment, James Cleverly and his Home Office ministers are taking questions in the Commons. It is Cleverly’s first question session in his new job. At the weekend Cleverly alarmed some Tory rightwingers when he told the Times in an interview that the Rwanda deportation policy wasn’t “the be-all and end-all” of government policy on this issue. He said: My frustration is that we have allowed the narrative to be created that this was the be-all and end-all. The mission is to stop the boats. That’s the promise to the British people. Never lose sight of the mission. There are multiple methods. Don’t fixate on the methods. Focus on the mission. This came only a week after Cleverly refused to deny calling the Rwanda policy “batshit” in private. The second question on the order paper was about small boats and Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, answered, instead of Cleverly himself. James Morris, a Conservative, used to have a go at Cleverly over this and he asked Jenrick if he agreed with his boss about Rwanda not being the be-all and end-all. And if he did agree, what was the government’s policy on small boats, he asked. Jenrick defended Cleverly, saying that, although Rwanda was “an extremely important component” of the small boats strategy, it was not the only policy being pursued. Burnham says he was shocked when the Scottish government announced a travel ban on people coming from Salford or Manchester. He was not given any warning about this, he says. He says the Scottish government was doing what it always criticised Westminster for doing: imposing measures without consultation. Burnham says he wanted to be able to run his own contact-tracing service. He says the problem with the national one was that they just called people by phone. He says he wanted the service to be run locally so that officials could knock on doors. Back at the Covid inquiry Andy Burnham says he was “astonished” in May 2020 when he heard the government was planning to ease Covid restrictions. He says the spread of the virus in Manchester was two or three weeks behind what was happening in London and the south of England, and that meant lifting restrictions for Manchester was not wise. He says this illustrates how there was a “London-centricity in decision making”. Manchester had a higher case rate at the time than London, he says. And he goes on: And I think because of that Greater Manchester was left stuck with a high case rate throughout the rest of 2020. Rishi Sunak will reject pleas to return the Parthenon marbles to Greece when he meets the country’s prime minister this week, Downing Street has indicated, saying the British Museum was the “right place” for the treasures. PA Media says: Athens has long demanded the return of the sculptures, which were removed from Greece by Lord Elgin in the early 19th century, when he was the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire. Kyriakos Mitsotakis has said he will raise the issue during meetings with Sunak and Keir Starmer during his visit to London. Downing Street on Monday pushed back against the Greek leader’s likening of the British Museum’s possession of the sculptures to the Mona Lisa painting being cut in half. Sunak’s spokesman stressed the PM’s support for the law that prevents the marbles from being permanently returned and suggested he would not be in favour of any loan arrangement. British Museum chairman George Osborne, the former chancellor, has previously said he is exploring ways for the marbles to be displayed in Greece, with speculation that this could involve a loan deal in which part of the sculptures would be sent to Athens. Asked about such an agreement, Sunak’s spokesman told reporters: “We have no plans to change our approach and certainly we think that the museum is the right place for them. I haven’t asked him specifically about short-term or new ideas that have been put forward, but I think he’s been fairly robust on his position.” Burnham says he “repeatedly” called for metro mayors to be invited to Cobra meetings to discuss Covid. During swine flu, when he was health secretary, Burnham says he recalls a wide variety of people being invited to Cobra meetings. He says having the metro mayors there would have enabled them to raise issues in a structured environment. For example, he and Steve Rotheram, the Liverpool city region mayor, repeatedly pushed for better financial support for people who had to isolate. Burnham says they had to raise this issue in the media. If they had been able to raise this in Cobra, the issue would have been taken up. Q: Did you ask to attend in writing? Burnham says he would have to check. But he repeatedly said he should be invited to Cobra in meetings with ministers, he says. He says he never attended a single Cobra meeting on Covid – even though he represents a region with 2.8 million people. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, has resumed his evidence to the Covid inquiry. He is being questioned by Dermot Keating, counsel for the inquiry. Burnham says on Monday 23 March he appeared on ITV’s Good Morning Britain and called for a national lockdown. He said that on the basis of the information he was getting from his own health advisers. Later he and other metro mayors had a meeting with Grant Shapps, the transport secretary. Shapps hinted that an announcement was coming later, but did not confirm it. Boris Johnson announced a national lockdown that night. Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, suggested to Rishi Sunak that he should authorise the start of pre-election talks between civil servants and the opposition before he left work on sick leave last month, Oliver Wright says in the Times. These talks routinely happen before an election, so the civil service can be ready if the opposition wins. But it is up to the PM to decide exactly when the process starts. But Sunak was not keen, Wright says. He reports: Sunak is said to have rebuffed [Case’s] proposal amid fears that it would send a signal to Whitehall that an election was imminent and result in officials “downing tools” and prioritising planning for the next government. A Downing Street source did not deny that the men had spoken but insisted that Sunak had not blocked the plan, claiming it was a matter for the cabinet secretary and that Labour had to formally ask for access talks to start. Towards the end of his evidence this morning Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said the government initially had “no understanding” of the importance of gathering data on the impact of Covid on different ethnic groups, PA Media reports. PA says: The inquiry heard Kahn wrote to then health secretary, Matt Hancock, on 7 May 2020 urging him to introduce routine ethnic data collection in death registrations, as evidence emerged of the disproportionate impact of the virus on black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. When he did not receive a response from Hancock, Khan wrote to then home secretary, Priti Patel, two weeks later to raise concerns. He added: “But it appeared to me the government didn’t really understand the issues that I was talking about.” Khan then suggested the deficit in understanding could have been due to few members of the cabinet representing diverse communities. He added: “I was given short shrift. There was no understanding of why it is important and also no action.” The government introduced the monitoring of ethnicity in October 2020. The Law Society of England and Wales has said further cuts to the criminal justice system as a consequence of the autumn statement would be “unthinkable” at a time when it is “crying out for investment”. The Office for Budget Responsibility’s (OBR) analysis of how tax cuts in the statement will be paid for suggests that “unprotected” departments such as the Ministry of Justice could face a real-terms cut in their budgets equivalent to 2.3% a year between now and the end of the next parliament. The Law Society president, Nick Emmerson, said: Chronic shortages of judges and lawyers mean there isn’t enough capacity to cover all the cases and some of the courtrooms they sit in are falling apart. The OBR’s report highlights the strain on public services including the crown court backlogs hitting a record high of 65,000 in August this year. There’s little hope of the government achieving its target of cutting the backlog to 53,000 by March 2025 unless it invests in justice now. He said numbers of criminal defence solicitors were in rapid decline and there are also huge delays in civil courts and large parts of the country where there are no legal aid lawyers available. Emmerson said the impact of further cuts on “an already overstretched and understaffed justice system” would be “unthinkable”. Back at the Covid inquiry Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, says early in the crisis he called for a daily briefing from scientists. He says, from his experience of swine flu, he thought it was better to have health messages coming from experts, not politicians. Heather Hallett, the chair, puts it to Burnham that, if experts did the briefings, people might think the experts had taken the decisions, not politicians. Burnham says in 2020 the problem was that it was “all merged together”. He accepts communication is difficult. But he repeats his point about how it would have been better to have heard more from experts. He says, when the government was putting areas into tier three restrictions, the public did not realise how little support these measures had from scientists, he says. The inquiry is now breaking for lunch. It will be back at 2.05pm. PA Media has more on the pay offer for hospital consultants in England. (See 12.51pm.) It says: The British Medical Association said the offer constituted a 4.95% “investment in pay” on top of the 6% pay rise already awarded this year. The majority of consultants will receive an extra rise of up to 12.8%, depending on their pay point, the BMA said, adding this was separate to any pay award recommended by the review body on doctors’ and dentists’ remuneration (DDRB) for 2024\/25. The union said if its members voted to accept the deal, the changes would be applicable from January 2024, but would be paid retrospectively in April 2024. And this is from Dr Vishal Sharma, BMA consultants committee chair. We are pleased that after a month of intense talks and more than six months of strike action we never wanted to take, we have now got an offer we can put to members. It is a huge shame that it has needed consultants to take industrial action to get the government to this point when we called for talks many months ago. The 4.95% investment and much-needed changes to the pay scale system comes after we successfully persuaded the government to reform the punitive pension taxation laws earlier this year, and we also now have commitments to reforming the pay review process, which has been a key ask from the profession throughout our dispute. Only by restoring the independence of this process can we hope to restore consultant pay over the coming years. How each consultant will benefit will depend on their individual circumstances, and we will be providing them with as much detail as we can, so they are able to look carefully through the details to help them decide whether to accept the offer. Burnham say he first became aware of Covid as a result of contacts with the Chinese community in Manchester. The city has a long-standing twinning arrangement with Wuhan, he says. He was aware of the problem from January 2020, he says. Back at the Covid inquiry Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, has just started giving evidence. He confirms that he is also a former health secretary. As soon as he was appointed, he had to deal with swine flu, he confirms. Consultants in England have reached a deal with the government which could potentially end strikes, PA Media reports. PA says: The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said it reached an agreement with consultants from the British Medical Association (BMA) and the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA) after weeks of talks. The deal will now be put to members of the unions. If members agree to the deal, strikes by top hospital doctors would end. DHSC officials said the new offer will “modernise the consultant contract and reform consultants’ pay structure”. Commenting on the offer, Rishi Sunak said: Ending damaging strike action in the NHS is vitally important if we want to continue making progress towards cutting waiting lists while making sure patients get the care they deserve. This is a fair deal for consultants who will benefit from major reform to their contract, it is fair for taxpayers because it will not risk our ongoing work to tackle inflation, and most importantly it is a good deal for patients to see the end of consultant industrial action. Turning away from the Covid inquiry, Rishi Sunak told the global investment summit that the appointment of David Cameron as foreign secretary did not mean the government wanted a return to the “golden era” approach to relations with China promoted by Cameron when he was PM. Sunak said: If David was here what he would say is the China of today is not the China he dealt with over a decade ago. It has changed, it’s right that our strategy evolves to take account of that. Our strategy can be summarised in three approaches: it’s to protect, align and engage. We have got to protect the UK against the risks, where they manifest themselves. Sadiq Khan is now being questioned by Brenda Campbell KC, who is representing Northern Ireland Covid Bereaved Families for Justice and Covid Bereaved Families for Justice. Khan says it was “frustrating” that UK ministers did not seem to trust the metro mayors. This was surprising given that they are willing to trust mayors when dealing with issues like terrorism, he says. He says there was an assumption of bad faith which was unfair. UPDATE: Khan said: This is the frustrating thing. If the government under different prime ministers can trust us on issues to do with terrorism, counter-terrorism, and other issues, you’d think they’d be able to trust us when it comes to issues to do with a civil emergency, a crisis like the pandemic. I think there was bad faith on the part of some members of the government, without being party political, and they projected that on us, whether it’s first ministers or mayors, which I think is unfair. Khan told the inquiry that, if the government had acted earlier in the autumn of 2020, as he was proposing (see 12.27pm), a second lockdown could have been avoided. And, if that had happened, there would have been less damage to the economy, he said. Sadiq Khan wrote to Boris Johnson in September 2020 saying he thought further restrictions were needed, the inquiry hears. Andrew O’Connor, counsel for the inquiry, shows an extract from the letter. Khan says he realised early on that ethnic minority people were being disproportionately affected by Covid. He says he wrote to the families of all Transport for London staff who died, when he had their details. The names were all ethnic minority ones, he says. Back at the Covid inquiry Sadiq Khan has resumed giving evidence. He says there were nine metro mayors at the start of the pandemic. He says they used to talk regularly, on a cross-party basis. Subsequently the number of mayors went up to 10, he says. He says he also had calls with first ministers of the devolved governments. Andrew O’Connor, counsel for the inquiry, shows an extract from Khan’s witness statement describing one of these calls. It took place on 19 May 2020, and the participants thought the UK government was “not engaging sufficiently” with them, Khan said. The Covid inquiry has stopped for a short break. Turning back to Kemi Badenoch, the business and trade secretary, in an interview with Sky News this morning she went further than some other ministers have gone in defending Israel over its conduct in the war against Hamas. She said as far as she was aware, Israel had not broken international law. She went on: It looks like they have taken great pains to make sure we are staying within the confines of the law. We applaud them for that. This is not the view of many experts, including António Guterres, the United Nations secretary general. After Sadiq Khan sent his letter to Boris Johnson on 22 March 2020, the pair spoke by phone. O’Connor showed the inquiry extracts from a transcript of the call. They show that Johnson was concerned about the “great economic cost” of a lockdown. Khan said he thought at this point Johnson had still not yet decided to go ahead with a full lockdown. O’Connor reveals a private letter that Khan sent to Johnson on Sunday 22 March. In the letter, Khan called for a mandatory lockdown, and said that if Johnson did not order one, he would tell Londoners himself that they should act as if one were in place. Khan said that the government’s messaging was not clear, that people were ignoring the message to stay at home, and that as a result lives were at risk. Khan tells the inquiry he had a meeting with Boris Johnson at No 10 on Thursday 19 March. He says the discussed doing a press conference together. But this was cancelled. O’Connor says Dominic Cummings, the PM’s chief adviser, subsequently said one reasons for cancelling the press conference was the desire not to alarm the financial markets. Khan says he attended another Cobra meeting on Friday 20 March. But that was not chaired by the PM, he says. UPDATE: PA Media reports: Boris Johnson was “not aware” that other countries had imposed lockdowns in March 2020, Sadiq Khan has said. The London mayor met the then-prime minister in Downing Street on 19 March, and said it was “clear” to him that some proposals for lockdown measures “had been surfaced, but the prime minister wasn’t persuaded”. He told the Covid-19 Inquiry: “The prime minister wasn’t aware that in other parts of the world they had lockdowns in place and fines could be issued if you breached the lockdown. I was surprised he wasn’t aware of that in relation to what was happening elsewhere.” Khan said he felt that the UK’s “advantage” in being able to see what was happening in the rest of the world “wasn’t being used”. Johnson ordered the full national lockdown on Monday 23 March – four days after the conversation described by Khan. But Khan did attend a Cobra meeting on Monday 16 March, he tells the inquiry. He says he was told for the first time at this meeting how bad the situation was. (This was the day Johnson told people to stay at home.) He says he was told about the “really serious” problem posed by people with Covid in intensive care units in London hospitals. And he says Johnson described this as the biggest challenge facing the country since the second world war He says he felt he had been “kept in the dark as the elected mayor of London”. I had been kept in the dark as the elected mayor of London and I felt almost winded in relation to what was happening in London and also realising there were things we could have done in relation to some of these issues.” I was alarmed by what I was being told in relation to where we were and where we may go to. I will never forget that sort of feeling of lack of power, lack of influence, not knowing what was happening in our city. There were things he could have done if he had known was the situation was, he says. Some measures he had taken – like enhanced cleaning on the Underground. But he was alarmed by the situation, he says – and concerned by his lack of power. Heather Hallett, the chair, says Khan was warned by Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, that a pandemic was coming. She asks what Khan would have done differently. Khan replies: Some of the things that happened subsequently. So it was me that lobbied the prime minister to go to lockdown, it was me that lobbied the prime minister in relation to the inability to keep social distance on public transport so people shouldn’t be using public transport unless they had to. Hallett says it would still have been for government to take the actual decisions. Khan accepts that, but he says if he had been at Cobra, he could have pushed for those earlier. Khan confirms he was again refused permission to attend a Cobra meeting on Covid on Thursday 12 March. “To say I was frustrated is an understatement,” he says. At the inquiry Sadiq Khan is being questioned by Andrew O’Connor, counsel for the inquiry. O’Connor has presented email exchanges showing that in early March Khan was asking to be invited to the Cobra meetings where Covid was being discussed. He showed emails showing that No 10 twice refused to let him attend. In one exchange, on Monday 9 March, Edward Lister, Boris Johnson’s chief of staff, argued that Khan should not be invited because, if he came, other metro mayors, like Greater Manchester’s, would have to be invited too. Khan told the inquiry that he thought London was a special case, because of its large population, the number of people travelling by public transport, its role as a transport hub, and the fact that virus seemed to be spreading there faster than in other parts of the country. But he also said he did not see why other mayors could not attend too. They could participate by Zoom, he said. UPDATE: Khan said: In this particular case, I can see no explanation at all why … the Greater London Authority, the mayor of London were not around the table. I think lives could have been saved if we were there earlier. At the Covid inquiry Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said that he was not getting information from the government in February about Covid. He said he was “disappointed” by that. In late February and early March he was getting information from other cities around the world instead, he said. He said this happened even though his foreign affairs team consisted of just three people. The feed is here: UPDATE: Khan said: The government generally does give us information about a variety of things happening. I’m disappointed the government weren’t giving us information in February about what they knew then. In his speech at the global investment summit Rishi Sunak claimed that the government was cutting taxes. He said: When I say that this country can be the best place in the world to invest in to do business you should believe me because of three big competitive advantages that we have – our low tax approach, our culture of innovation, and our people. The purest expression of this government’s economic philosophy is that people and businesses make far better decisions about their own money than any government could. And I believe that allowing you to keep more of the return on your capital, our country becomes more competitive as a place to invest, grow and create jobs. And make no mistake, we are cutting taxes. Not only do we have the lowest corporation tax rate in the G7. Last week, we announced that we would make full expensing permanent. That means you can write off the cost of many capital investments in full. It makes our capital allowances regime one of the most generous in the world and it was the biggest business tax cut in modern Britain. The government did announce significant tax cuts in the autumn statement. But those won’t be enough to compensate for the impact of previous tax rises announced since 2019 that will take the tax burden to a post-war record high. Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, will not appear to the Covid inquiry this year due to an ongoing health problem, PA Media reports. PA says: In a ruling published this morning, inquiry chairwoman Heather Hallett formally excused Case from giving evidence in 2023 “due to ill health”. Hallett said she would receive an update on Case’s ability to give evidence at the end of January 2024 or on his return to work from sick leave, and is expected to convene a special hearing to receive his evidence. She said in her ruling: “It very much remains my intention that Mr Case should give oral evidence to the inquiry.” At the Covid inquiy Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has just started giving evidence. I will be covering the highlights, and there is a live feed at the top of the blog. Rishi Sunak has just delivered a speech at the opening of the global investment summit. Mostly he focused on what he described as the strengths of the UK economy, but his speech also illustrated why immigration is such a difficult topic for the government. While people worry about high immigration numbers because of the pressure on housing and services, there is also a strong economic case for more immigration, and Sunak told his audience that the UK wanted to see high-flyers move to Britain. He said: We don’t have a monopoly on talent in this country. And we recognise that nearly half of our most innovative companies have an immigrant founder. So if you’re an innovator and entrepreneur or researcher, you should know that the most competitive visa regime for highly-skilled international talent is right here in the UK. And let me just give you one example. Our new high potential individual visa means that, if you’re a young person who’s graduated from a global top 50 university, you can just come to the UK and stay here with your family for two years to just explore, work, study, invent. Nothing like that exists anywhere else in the world, and it tells you everything about our pro-innovation, pro-growth, pro-business philosophy. In her interviews this morning Kemi Badenoch, the business and trade secretary, gently delivered a reprimand to Boris Johnson over his record on immigration. Asked about his column in the Daily Mail, in which he called for the minimum salary threshold for work visas to be raised to £40,000 (see 9.23am), she said she had not read what he had written. But she told LBC: I certainly will be pushing for the strongest measures possible. The migration figures that we’ve seen [last week] were from last year. That was under Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Many of us had reservations about the policy then. So I think that you will be seeing much, much tougher measures going forward. In 2019, when Johnson was PM and fighting the election, the Tory manifesto said that overall immigration numbers “will come down”. Instead net migration figures are now more than three times as high as they were four years ago, leading to widespread complaints – most notably from Tory MPs – that a promise has been broken. In his Mail column Johnson refused to accept this argument, While he did not contest the facts, he claimed that it was the anti-Brexiteers who had been proved wrong. He said: Look carefully at those immigration figures, and you can see much that reflects well on the UK. The numbers show, most obviously, that the anti-Brexit brigade were totally wrong about the attractions of post-Brexit Britain. They said we would become a kind of global leper, reeking of xenophobia, and that the world’s talent would stay away. Well that was always rubbish — and these figures prove it. What the numbers also show is that after Brexit we underestimated the magnetic pull of the UK; and the numbers show that the British labour market is continuing to inspire large numbers of low-skilled people to want to come to work here — and for low incomes. That is a mistake. Johnson said Brexit gave the UK government the power to impose tougher restrictions. And, in so far as he explained why he had not introduced the £40,000 minimum salary threshold for workers he now wants when he was actually in power himself, he suggested it was the fault of the migration advisory committee, which had recommended a threshold of £26,000. Rishi Sunak has brushed aside reports that Reform UK, the fringe party challenging the Conservatives from the right, might be trying to poach his MPs. As he arrived at Hampton Court this morning, Sunak was asked if he was worried about defections following the revelation that Lee Anderson, the deputy Tory chair, was approached by Reform UK. In response, Sunak just said he was “focused on delivering for the British people”. In her interview on Today this morning Kemi Badenoch, the business and trade secretary, complained that the programme was ignoring good news from the government. She was referring to the investment in the UK worth £30bn announced to coincide with the global investment summit taking place today, and Rishi Sunak said this morning this showed there was “very positive momentum” behind the economy. He said: My singular focus is driving growth and creating jobs across the UK. So I’m delighted that we’ve secured investments worth around £30bn, three times the amount that was secured the last time this summit was held a little while ago. And that comes on the back of a very positive autumn statement where we cut taxes for those businesses that are investing in our future growth and also the great announcements from Nissan last week, securing the future of that plant in Sunderland, building three new lines of the next generation of electric vehicles. So very positive momentum behind the UK economy. But until now the government’s investment record has not been much to boast about. In a recent Financial Times column Camilla Cavendish, who was head of policy in No 10 when David Cameron was PM, said that since Brexit “Britain has begun a slow, mournful slide down the OECD rankings for foreign direct investment: from 12th place in 2015 to 20th in 2022”. And last week, without much fanfare, the government published as part of the autumn statement a review of foreign direct investment carried out by Lord Harrington, a Tory former business minister. In his report Harrington said he was asked to carry out the review “because of concerns at the highest levels of government that the UK is missing out on potentially transformational investments by multinational companies and foreign investors”. And he concluded: The evidence we have received reflects a picture of the UK rich in advantages: our language, our open and vibrant culture, our outstanding research base, the deeply embedded rule of law, the pull of London as one of the world’s great financial centres, and many other assets. However, the barriers outlined in this review, and the uncertainty they create, act like a tax on investment. We have heard time and again about government systems that are too often disorganised, risk-averse, siloed, and inflexible when it comes to the needs of modern investors … All too slow and cumbersome to compete in the modern world. The government has accepted Harrington’s key recommendations in principle. Rishi Sunak told reporters as he arrived at the global investment summit at Hampton Court that net migration levels were too high and that he would be taking action to bring them down. He said: I’m very clear that the levels of net migration are too high. They need to come down to more sustainable levels. It is encouraging that the Office for National Statistics last week said the numbers are slowing but we need to do more. I have already taken action to tighten the number of dependants that students can bring when they come to study here. As we need to do more, we’ll look at that and where there are abuses of the system we will of course act. Good morning. After Suella Braverman was sacked as home secretary, her allies told the Daily Express she had a “grid of shit” ready to unleash on Rishi Sunak. The latest instalment from this media planning schedule landed on the front page of the Daily Telegraph last night, and in his story for the paper Charles Hymas publishes details of what Braverman claims is the deal she agreed with Sunak when he offered her the Home Office in response for her backing in the Tory leadership contest last autumn. Hymas says: Mr Sunak agreed to a four-point migration plan as he sought her support during his leadership bid last year, allies of Mrs Braverman say. Chief among them was a pledge to raise the minimum salary threshold required for a foreign skilled worker visa from £26,000 to £40,000, a proposal that was publicly backed last week by Boris Johnson, the architect of the post-Brexit points-based migration system. A copy of the agreement on migration, seen by the Telegraph, showed that they proposed to close down the graduate visa route, restrict the number of dependants that legal migrants could bring and prioritise Russell Group university applicants when evaluating student visa applications. This is embarrassing for Sunak because it implies he has been slow and complacent. Last week, after the ONS published figures showing net migration reached a record 745,000 in 2022, Sunak said he would act to bring these numbers down – but he refused to say what he was considering. Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, is reportedly urging Sunak to introduce a minimum salary threshold for foreigners coming to the UK on work visas of £35,000. No 10 has not embraced this idea, but Braverman’s intervention means that, even if Sunak were to accept the Jenrick plan, it would look a bit modest compared to her proposal. In his Daily Mail column on Saturday Boris Johnson, the former PM, also said the salary threshold should be set at £40,000 (something he never did during his three years in office). He said: You will remember that after Brexit everyone was wailing about the thought of EU workers fleeing Britain, and business was worried about shortages. So the Migration Advisory Committee put the minimum at only £26,000 – not much more than the living wage. The effects of this were perhaps masked by the Covid pandemic, when migration was largely suppressed. But it is clear from these numbers that the Migration Advisory Committee pitched it way too low. It turns out that they had massively underestimated the number of EU nationals still living in Britain – by at least a million; and they underestimated the continuing attractions of the UK to all migrants, EU and non-EU. The minimum income for most types of migrant worker coming to the UK should now go right up to £40,000 or more – because it is the right thing for migrant workers, and for the entire British workforce. Kemi Badenoch, the business and trade secetary, has been doing a media round this morning. Badenoch and Braverman are expected to be the lead candidates for the right in the next Tory leadership contest (Badenoch is the favourite) and, even though Badenoch said it was not for her to say what the minimum salary threshold for work visas should be, she said that she was in favour of “much, much tougher measures”. She suggested that this was what Sunak was planning anyway. She told LBC: I am certainly in favour of us doing whatever it takes to bring the numbers down to a sustainable level. This is not something that I’m being mealy-mouthed about. But what I don’t want to do is go into the specifics when I don’t know what the plan is, but I certainly will be pushing for the strongest measures possible. The migration figures that we’ve seen were from last year … I think that you will be seeing much, much tougher measures going forward. Certainly this prime minister has said that we need to do whatever it takes on the boats, to get those planes flying, deporting people who shouldn’t be here. And when it comes to the people who we do let into this country, we need to make sure that they’re not undercutting our workforce, and that they are people who are coming to the UK to contribute and actually to help make our country better. Sunak spoke to reporters as he arrived at Hampton Court this morning for the global investment summit, but did not say any more on this topic than he said last week. But James Cleverly, the home secretary, is taking questions in the Commons this afternoon, and he may give more details of what the government might do. And immigration is not the only “grid of shit” problem for Sunak. He probably feels much the same way about the timetable of witnesses at the Covid inquiry. Three Labour metro mayors are giving evidence this week, but things could get even more embarrassing for the government later this week when four cabinet ministers are questioned. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: Rishi Sunak gives a speech at the opening of the global investment summit at Hampton Court. 10.30am: Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, gives evidence to the Covid inquiry. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester is due to give evidence later in the morning and in the afternoon, after Burnham has finished, Steve Rotheram, mayor of Liverpool city region, is appearing. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 2.30pm: James Cleverly takes questions in the Commons for the first time in his new post as home secretary. He is expected to confirm that the government is considering further controls on legal migration. Also, the government is publishing its leasehold and freedhold reform bill today.

       "     'bodyText': 'Conservative MPs have not been offered money to defect to Reform UK, the party’s leader, Richard Tice, has stressed, amid claims that Lee Anderson was offered “a lot of money” last month. Anderson, the MP for Ashfield and one of the Conservative party’s deputy chairs, was recorded telling Tory activists last month: “A political party that begins with an R offered me a lot of money to join them. I mean a lot of money, I mean a lot of money.” The leaked recording, obtained by the Sunday Times, was from a “lagers with Lee” meeting at Cambridge rugby club, hosted by the South Cambridgeshire Conservative Association, during which Anderson said Reform would win “zero seats” at the next election. The Reform leader, Tice, rejected the claims, saying he had “numerous discussions with a number of Tory MPs, ministers and former ministers who are absolutely furious with the complete betrayal of the government’s promises, furious with their failure to stop the boats, furious with opening the borders to mass immigration”. But, he told the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme: “Let me make it absolutely clear, no cash or money has in any way been offered. What has been offered is the chance to change the shape of the debate.” Tice went as far as claiming that Anderson had “used the threat of defecting to Reform to negotiate himself the deputy chairmanship”. Anderson has been approached for comment. It was reported earlier this year that the Conservative chief whip, Simon Hart, had reported Reform UK to the Commons speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, over allegations that the party had offered MPs who defected a full salary for five years – even if the politicians lost their seats. Hart was reported as highlighting that Tories were being offered £400,000-plus “bribes” to defect. On Saturday night, the Conservative party confirmed it now had 10 deputy chairs, including Rachel Maclean, who was sacked as housing minister, and Sara Britcliffe, the youngest Tory MP elected in the 2019 election at the age of 24. The Conservatives are aware of the threat posed by the newly named Reform UK: the Brexit party, with Rishi Sunak warning disgruntled Tory voters: “A vote for everyone who is not a Conservative is a vote to put Keir Starmer into office.” His remarks were echoed by the chief secretary to the Treasury, Laura Trott, who said she was not worried about Reform UK outflanking her party. Reform UK, previously named the Brexit party and headed by Nigel Farage, has never had any MPs. In the coming weeks, Reform will announce hundreds of candidates as it seeks to build on momentum behind a stated desire to “destroy” the Conservatives. Even at the cost of splitting the rightwing vote, Tice has said every Tory candidate will face a Reform opponent in the next general election, dismissing any rerun of the 2019 deal in which the Brexit party stood aside in more than 300 Tory-held seats after Boris Johnson gave commitments on a hard Brexit. Anderson told activists in the recording that the Conservatives were “not perfect” and that he hated campaigning with the motto that the “opposition’s worse than us”, but warned them that a vote for Reform was a vote for Labour. “I spoke to the leaders of Reform – they want PR … they are hellbent and want us to get hammered in the next election … all they want is a bit of power in parliament.” At the Reform party conference, Farage joined Tice in accusing the Conservatives of copying their rhetoric on immigration, “but not the actions”. The pair have sought to paint the Reform party as an alternative for those on the Tory right who voted leave in the 2016 EU referendum. Farage has been seeking to win over television viewers with his stint on the reality show I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out Of Here!. Reform UK has only taken small proportions of the vote in recent byelections. Recent YouGov polling found that voters who supported the Tories in 2019 were more likely to switch to Reform than to Labour, and there have been suggestions that such switchers cost Sunak’s party the recent byelection in Mid Bedfordshire.'},\n",

       "     'bodyText': 'Rishi Sunak has vowed to “clamp down” on immigration and conceded, in the face of growing Tory anger about his past performance, that there is “obviously a lot more to do” to reduce the record numbers of people immigrating to the UK. Earlier this week, official figures showed net migration is running at a record high, prompting Boris Johnson, Suella Braverman and other rightwing Conservatives to attack Sunak for failing to honour the government’s 2019 Tory manifesto pledge to bring overall migration numbers down. Sunak initially refused to comment when asked whether he would apologise for failing to meet this pledge, which was given by Johnson. On Thursday, the Office for National Statistics revealed net migration into the UK peaked at 745,000 in the year to December 2022, meaning nearly three-quarters of a million more people legally immigrated to the UK than left the country. This figure is three times higher than the levels seen before Brexit. Speaking to the Mail on Sunday, the prime minister said: “There is obviously a lot more to do and that’s why we need to take action. I announced previously significant tightening up on the number of dependents that students can bring, which has seen a very striking rise over the past year or two. “This represents the single biggest measure of restriction on legal migration that anyone’s announced in years. That should give people a sense of my determination to bring these numbers down. “As we go over them, as we see other areas of abuse, we won’t hesitate to take action and clamp down,” he added. The immigration minister, Robert Jenrick, is understood to have worked up a plan designed to appease calls from rightwing Tories for the government to take action. His plan is said to include proposals to scrap the shortage occupation list, a programme that allows foreign workers to be paid 20% below the going rate in roles where there is a shortage of skilled workers. The government’s migration advisory committee has already recommended the abolition of the list amid fears it is being used to bring cheap foreign labour into the UK. Downing Street refused to say what Sunak made of Jenrick’s proposals when asked by journalists, saying No 10 would not be getting into “running commentary on policy development”. However, any attempt to bring down the number of skilled workers arriving in the UK is likely to be met with anger and resistance by people working in the NHS and social care, where there are chronic staff shortages. Sunak tried to defend his immigration record by stressing there has been a fall in the number of people arriving by small boat across the Channel. He said: “I’ve come into this job, I’ve had it for a year and I’ve already got the numbers down by a third, so I think people can trust me when I say I’m going to do something, I’m going to deliver on it. “I need to finish the job and that means getting the Rwanda deal up and running. I’m prepared to do whatever is necessary to get that scheme operational.” Sunak has pledged not to let a “foreign court” stop flights to Rwanda, with plans for a new treaty and emergency legislation to ensure the plan is legally watertight. But it was the UK supreme court, rather than “a foreign court”, that dealt the latest blow to the government’s hopes of sending asylum seekers who arrive in the UK on a one-way flight to Rwanda. Sunak also played down claims by Braverman that she had struck a deal with him to lend his leadership candidacy her support in exchange for key promises. “Of course you have conversations with people when you are in a leadership election and not just Suella,” Sunak said. Asked about whether she could produce proof of a deal, he said: “That’s a question for her. I’m getting on with actually delivering things.” In further comments to the Mail on Sunday, Sunak also said that Jeremy Hunt’s recent tax-cutting autumn statement is the “start of a journey”, suggesting he is contemplating further tax cuts before the next general election, which is scheduled to be held no later than 28 January 2025. He said the government will “do more than we can” on tax cuts. “I always said I wanted to cut people’s taxes, but first we had to get inflation under control and stabilise the economy,” Sunak said. “We have now done that and it didn’t happen by accident. The chancellor and I took a set of decisions that weren’t easy, that we got a lot of flak for, that the Labour party opposed, in order to halve inflation and defy the sceptics. “Everyone said we were going to have a recession this year in the UK (but) we have actually grown the economy. Because of that our economic policy can shift gears.” He added: “This is the start of a journey. We will do more when we can, because I want to cut taxes, reward hard work, grow the economy and do so in a way that is responsible.” According to the Office for Budget Responsibility, the 2p national insurance cut Hunt made in his statement will offset only a quarter of personal tax-raising measures announced by the government since 2021, which includes freezing allowances and national insurance thresholds. The average UK household will be £1,900 poorer by the end of this parliament, the Resolution Foundation thinktank has predicted, with the top fifth of households in Britain projected to gain the most from Hunt’s tax cuts. It said they would benefit by £1,000 on average, five times the gains of the bottom 20%, who would be only £200 better off from measures that include a 2p cut in national insurance.'},\n",

       "     'bodyText': 'On Thursday afternoon, the good people of Stockton-on-Tees were preparing for Stockton Sparkles, an annual festive event that promises to transform its commanding high street – known as the widest in the UK – into a “winter wonderland”. But wonderland was not the word on everyone’s lips. Instead, it was the description of the place allegedly employed by the home secretary, James Cleverly, during prime minister’s questions on Wednesday. Alex Cunningham, Labour MP for Stockton North, said Cleverly had uttered the phrase when he asked Rishi Sunak: “Why are 34% of children in my constituency living in poverty?” Before the prime minister could respond, several observers, including Cunningham, heard Cleverly say “because it’s a shit-hole”, though after first issuing a blanket denial, the home secretary subsequently claimed he had called Cunningham a “shit MP’. It’s fair to say the audio evidence doesn’t entirely support that claim. Perhaps used to being the subject of disparaging remarks, many locals responded with a well-rehearsed line in self-deprecating humour. “If he thinks Stockton’s bad,” said one man, “he should go to Middlesbrough.” “He could have taken the edge off it,” suggested Kenneth Goodall, who owns a small shop in the Shambles mini-precinct. “But then again, he could have spoken more honestly and called it much worse.” Most locals agree that the town has seen better economic times. Teesside was once an industrial hub whose pollution-spewing factories led to locals being known as “smoggies” after the smog that was a regular atmospheric feature. The main shopping centre has recently been knocked down and redevelopment is under way, but there’s a familiar post-industrial emptiness to the town centre that an abundance of charity shops, pound shops and betting shops doesn’t begin to fill. “There’s a lack of work and funds, and no attention is paid to the area, not just Stockton but across the north-east,” said a woman called Helen. “If he’s got a problem with Stockton, why doesn’t he do something about it?” Whatever Cleverly said, many local people think that the government has turned its back on the north. All the talk of a northern powerhouse and levelling up seems increasingly to them to be just that: talk. Stockton, like all of Teesside, voted by a large majority for Brexit. That continental divorce was supposed to usher in a new era of autonomy, prosperity and, critically, wealth redistribution. In the regions, there was a strong perception that the affluent south-east looked towards Europe rather than its stricken hinterlands, and Boris Johnson encouraged the idea that the UK’s departure from the EU would correct historic structural divisions almost as a matter of course. That vision hasn’t materialised. As a recent paper from Harvard Kennedy School concluded, levelling up is hard work that requires investment, innovation and determination – none of which, it might be added, the government shows much appetite for producing. In that sense, while Cleverly’s alleged comment may have been throwaway, it also speaks of a cabinet weariness at the scale of the problems with which it is ineffectually grappling. What’s striking in Stockton is the lack of expectation that things would be any other way. They are used to people in power “looking down their nose” at them, as one man put it. Many others have internalised the criticism, echoing it in different ways, denigrating the town or lamenting the growth in “crackheads”, “alcoholics” and “immigrants”. One older man started out talking of Cleverly being a “disgrace” and a “typical Tory” before registering his disappointment with Brexit, chiefly because of the rise in immigration. “We used to get Europeans, now it’s just boat people.” Only one woman, who worked for the council and therefore did not want to be named, articulated the negative potential of Cleverly’s verdict. “The government shouldn’t be saying that because it could put off investors and have a really bad effect on companies coming in. An opinion like that he should have kept to himself.” The long-term sick that the government are keen to get back to work make up almost 40% of economically inactive people in Stockton, compared with 26% nationally – a sure sign of deep-rooted social deprivation, as is child poverty, the issue that Cunningham highlighted and which prompted Cleverly’s insult. But it would be wrong to assume that Stockton is in some kind of death spiral. Many of its inhabitants feel extremely proud of their hometown, not least the young. “It’s filled with wonderful people and like-minded people who make a brilliant community,” said Marina Gears. “And the council funds some wonderful events. I just can’t wait to get the Tories out.” For Adam Would, the language Cleverly used is “typical of the way working-class areas are described”. He thought it betrayed an ignorance of communities like Stockton, of their histories and culture. “The big thing in areas like this,” he said, “is the work ethic and how people get together. It’s what’s made this country great.” Those are the kinds of rousing words you’d want a senior politician to voice to help rally an area that has known too many down days of late. Ideally, someone in government, better still in cabinet. Someone with a responsibility for the safety and security of our communities, especially those that are in greatest need of protection and help. Someone, in other words, like the home secretary. That he chose instead to badmouth a part of the world that has endured chronic political neglect says much more about the politician than it does of the town of Stockton.'},\n",

       "     'bodyText': 'James Cleverly has said he is frustrated with the fixation on the government’s Rwanda policy, saying it is not the “be all and end all” of plans to tackle illegal immigration. The home secretary, who replaced Suella Braverman after she was sacked almost a fortnight ago, told the Times he had become frustrated with the focus on the Rwanda plan. “My frustration is that we have allowed the narrative to be created that this was the be all and end all,” he said. “The mission is to stop the boats. That’s the promise to the British people. Never lose sight of the mission. There are multiple methods. Don’t fixate on the methods. Focus on the mission.” The Rwanda scheme has faced a series of legal hurdles since it was first announced in 2020, the latest of which came on Cleverly’s second day as home secretary, when the policy was ruled unlawful by the supreme court. Despite the setbacks, the government has not dropped the idea. Rishi Sunak has refused to rule out leaving the European convention on human rights (ECHR) and he is thought to be considering using emergency legislation to opt out of the convention on asylum cases in an effort to force through the Rwanda scheme. While it was a UK court that dealt the latest legal blow to the legislation, Sunak’s Tories are keen to ensure the ECHR, and the European court of human rights that rules on it, will not prevent the policy being implemented. The new home secretary struck a more measured tone on the ECHR in contrast to his predecessor. “My argument has always been that we need to modernise, update and reform,” he said. “What some people, I fear, do is jump to their preferred solution and hang on to that really, really tightly and say this cannot be the right answer unless you do a particular thing. “I do not want to do anything that might undermine the key cooperation we have with countries [who] are very wedded to the ECHR for understandable reasons. “Nothing is cost free. Everything needs to be considered, the advantages and disadvantages.” Net migration to the UK reached a record 745,000 in the year to December 2022, according to revised estimates published by the Office for National Statistics on Thursday. The data places migration levels at three times higher than before Brexit, despite a Conservative party 2019 manifesto pledge to bring overall numbers down. Sunak is under pressure from Conservative MPs angered by the latest data on legal net migration. The former prime minister Boris Johnson became the latest Tory to pile pressure on the prime minister to act on immigration on Friday. He said in his Daily Mail column the figures were “way, way too big” and that the minimum income for most migrant workers coming to the UK should rise to £40,000. Senior Conservatives have said Sunak risks ripping up the Northern Ireland peace process if he blocks human rights laws so the UK can deport asylum seekers to Rwanda. He is under increasing pressure from right-leaning MPs and ministers to close off legal avenues to asylum seekers who have successfully challenged their removal to Rwanda.'},\n",

       "     'bodyText': 'Rishi Sunak risks ripping up the Northern Ireland peace process if he blocks human rights laws so the UK can deport asylum seekers to Rwanda, senior Conservatives have said. After similar concerns from the White House on Thursday, the MPs said widely reported plans from Downing Street to disregard parts of the Human Rights Act could undermine the Good Friday agreement and damage UK-US relations. The warnings come as the prime minister is under increasing pressure from right-leaning MPs and ministers to close off legal avenues to asylum seekers who have successfully challenged their removal to Rwanda. The government is expected next week to revive the Rwanda policy of sending people seeking asylum to east Africa after the supreme court ruled that the plans were unlawful. Sunak believes the government can address the court’s concerns with a new treaty with Rwanda, which could be signed next week by James Cleverly, the home secretary, and emergency legislation to block future legal challenges to the policy. In an interview with the Times, Cleverly acknowledged he has become “frustrated” with the focus on Rwanda and that it should not be seen as the “be-all and end-all”. He said while it is an “important” part of the plans and will deter people from crossing the Channel in small boats, it is part of a broader strategy. Cleverly also said he believes leaving the European convention on human rights (ECHR) would jeopardise “key cooperation” with other countries including France, which has helped addressed illegal crossings into the UK. The New York Times reported on Thursday that senior White House officials were concerned that a block on legal challenges would damage the authority of the ECHR which is fundamental to the Good Friday agreement. Conservative Sir Bob Neill, chair of the justice select committee and a former minister, said he had similar concerns that attempts to block human rights laws would damage the authority of the ECHR and risk peace in Northern Ireland. “We have known for a long time that laws such as the European convention on human rights are a central part of the Good Friday agreement,” he said. “Anything that undermines the Good Friday agreement would be really dangerous for the peace process. There is no à la carte menu, where you can pick and choose which parts of the convention you wish to follow.” Asked if he agreed with reports that dozens of Tory MPs could vote against any attempt to undermine human rights laws or the ECHR, Neill said: “Yes. There is a very strong feeling that we have to be proportionate about this. We want to stop the boats. But we can’t rip up our international obligations.” A minister told the Guardian that there would be resignations from the government if any attempt to block human rights laws undermined the Good Friday agreement. “This agreement is fundamental to our place in the world. We all know what it means to Joe Biden. We are a government which believes in international law, and – I hope, I believe – the prime minister agrees,” the minister said. The development comes after Sunak refused to apologise after record levels of net immigration appeared to break a key election promise. Official figures on Thursday showed the difference between the number of people coming to live in the UK and those leaving had peaked at 745,000. In an interview at the Nissan car plant in Sunderland, Sunak declined to comment when asked if he would apologise for not meeting the manifesto pledge. “I’m very clear that the levels of migration are too high and they’ve got to come down to more sustainable levels,” he said. The immigration minister, Robert Jenrick, put forward a five-point plan to No 10 that included proposals for a required minimum annual salary of £35,000 in order to receive a work visa and a cap on the total number of visas for NHS and social care workers. Madeleine Sumption, the director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said both proposals could struggle to bring down the numbers, especially if there is not exemption for care workers. “The fundamental problem, and one that the immigration system cannot fix, is that care is poorly funded and the pay and conditions are not good enough to attract British workers into difficult and stressful jobs,” she said. “And the last time there was cap on skilled workers, the government dropped it as soon as it began to bite because it caused all sorts of operational difficulties.” Downing Street refused to say what Sunak makes of Jenrick’s proposals when asked by journalists, insisting No 10 would not be getting into “running commentary on policy development”. Boris Johnson said in a newspaper column that he would have raised the minimum salary threshold to £40,000 a year. “We have the powers to sort it out, and to change our immigration rules – which is exactly why the British people voted to take back those powers in 2016,” the former prime minister wrote in the Daily Mail. Johnson left office last year and in 2019 promised in his manifesto that “overall numbers will come down”. The ONS said on Thursday that the difference between the number of people legally arriving in Britain and those leaving was 745,000 in the year to December 2022. The figure is three times higher than the levels seen before Brexit. Many MPs on the right of the party, including the former home secretary Suella Braverman, have called on Sunak to honour the commitment to reducing the numbers. Calls to curb the number of foreign workers in the NHS and social care are likely to be met with resistance by health officials amid chronic staff shortages across the health and care sector.'},\n",

       "     'bodyText': 'Rishi Sunak has refused to apologise for record net immigration that breaks a key election promise, amid growing pressure for further government action from ministers and Conservative backbench MPs. Mel Stride, the work and pensions secretary, has rejected claims from the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank that the spending plans in the autumn statement imply more austerity is on the way. (See 9.25am.) The Foreign Office has issued a statement condemning the killing of Palestinian civilians by Israeli settlers in the West Bank, where David Cameron, the foreign secretary, has been meeting Palestinian leaders today. (See 3.31pm.) There has been much delight on X this afternoon about a video clip, from yesterday, showing Rishi Sunak apparently unable to use a hammer properly. Even the Labour party’s campaigns department has been joining in. At the risk of spoiling the fun, the BBC’s Ione Wells has established that Sunak was actually told to use the hammer sideways when he visited a jewellery making studio in Farsley, West Yorkshire. The Foreign Office has issued a statement condemning the killing of Palestinian civilians on the West Bank by Israeli settlers. It put out the statement in a post on X featuring a picture of David Cameron, the foreign secretary, at a viewpoint looking across the West Bank with Daniel Seidermann, an Israeli lawyer and peace campaigner. The Foreign Office says: Looking over the West Bank, @David_Cameron heard about the impact of settlement expansion and settler violence. Reports of Palestinian civilians being killed by settlers across the West Bank are appalling. Israel must prevent these acts of violence and hold those responsible to account. Downing Street has not denied reports that the Foreign Office intervened to “soften” language used by the culture secretary to avoid offending an Abu Dhabi-backed fund seeking to take over the Telegraph newspaper, PA Media reports. PA says: Lucy Frazer had suggested this week she was “minded” to open an investigation into whether the deal was against the public interest and the effect it may have on press freedom. She said she had written to the fund, RedBird IMI, as well as the publication’s previous owners, the Barclay family, and their bank, Lloyds, to inform them of the possible intervention. Officials are said to have been worried about offending the United Arab Emirates – which includes Abu Dhabi – ahead of a summit in London for foreign investors next week, the Telegraph reported. On Friday, Number 10 said it was “standard procedure” for the Foreign Office to advise other government departments. Asked whether there were concerns over the reports, a spokesperson said: “I wouldn’t usually get into speculative reporting. I would just say it’s also standard practice for the Foreign Office to provide advice to other government departments, but to be very clear this matter and decision is solely one for the culture secretary.” Alex Salmond, the former Scottish first minister, has said the Scottish government faces “a day of reckoning” as a result of his legal action against it. (See 1.26pm.) In a statement he said: Despite Lord Pentland’s findings in the court of session that the behaviour of the former permanent secretary and her officials was ‘unlawful’, ‘unfair’ and ‘tainted by apparent bias’, despite the ongoing police and Crown Office inquiries into the criminal leaks and potential perjury at the criminal trial, despite the astonishing revelations of misfeasance contained in the eventual publication of the government’s own legal advice, and despite the specific findings of the parliamentary inquiry into the conduct of the former permanent secretary and the former first minister, not one single person has been held accountable. With this court action that evasion of responsibility ends. Humza Yousaf, the current first minister, said the government would defend its record. Speaking in Dublin, where he is attending the British-Irish Council meeting, he said: Unsurprisingly to anyone listening or watching, the Scottish government will defend its position robustly, but I’ll say no more because that’s a live case. Alex Salmond, Scotland’s former first minister, has launched legal action against the Scottish government over its botched investigation of harassment complaints against him, PA Media reports. PA says: The court of session confirmed to the PA the case, Alex Salmond v Scottish ministers, had been called. The Herald reported the now-Alba party leader has alleged “misfeasance” by civil servants and is seeking £3m in damages and loss of earnings. Salmond – who was first minister between 2007 and 2014 – was investigated by the Scottish government after two complaints from staff were made under a new complaints procedure which included former ministers. The investigation was deemed by a judicial review to have been “tainted with apparent bias” after the Scottish government conceded defeat and Salmond was awarded £512,000 as a result. He was subsequently cleared of 13 charges of sexual misconduct – including attempted rape – following a trial at the high court in Edinburgh. Then followed a protracted Holyrood inquiry into the Scottish government’s handling of the original two complaints, which called both Salmond and former first minister Nicola Sturgeon to give evidence. Pro-Europeans despair at Keir Starmer’s refusal to criticise Brexit, let alone to suggest that it should be reversed. But they may take some comfort from the fact that he has named Beethoven’s Ode to Joy, which serves as the EU’s anthem, as the piece of classical music that best sums up Labour. Starmer was responding to a question in an interview with Classic FM, and he told the station: One of the pieces I’ve got is Beethoven’s 9th Symphony, the choral Ode to Joy. You’ve got the orchestra, you’ve got the voices, you’ve got this big combination. This is very sort of Labour. You’re getting everybody, Beethoven’s getting everybody on to the stage for this. I talk about a national mission for the next Labour government. This is a sense of something. It has got a sense of destiny and is hugely optimistic. And so, for me, that’s been hardwired in me for a long, long time. So, I would go with that. There are many others that I could associate with the Labour party, but that sense of moving forward to a better place is incredibly powerful. As PA Media reports, Starmer was a former junior scholar at Guildhall and played the flute, piano and violin as a child. He has spoken previously of listening to Beethoven more generally to help deal with the strains of work, describing classical music as a “great release” for him. Rishi Sunak’s plan to pass a law that would stop anyone 14 or younger every being able to buy cigarettes (by raising the legal age at which people can buy them year by year) was inspired by legislation doing the same in New Zealand. It was passed by the governing Labour and Green parties and came into force in January this year. But, following an election last month, a rightwing coalition has taken power in New Zealand and, under the coalition agreement, it is going to repeal the law banning smoking for future generations. At the Downing Street lobby briefing this morning the No 10 spokesperson said the U-turn in New Zealand would not stop Sunak implementing the measure in the UK. Asked if Sunak would drop the plan, the spokesperson said: No, our position remains unchanged. We are committed to that. This is an important long-term decision and step to deliver a smoke-free generation which remains critically important. At the Downing Street lobby briefing this morning the No 10 spokesperson would not say whether Rishi Sunak supports the plans for tighter immigration controls reportedly proposed by Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister. The spokesperson just said discussions between No 10 and government departments were “routine”. But No 10 did back James Cleverly, the home secretary. Asked if Rishi Sunak found Cleverly’s new account of his foul-mouthed outburst at PMQs on Wednesday credible, the spokesperson said yes. When Nigel Farage was leading the Brexit party, it was considerably influential for a party with no MPs, winning the European elections in 2019 and helping to push the Conservative party into a harder position on Brexit. After the 2019 election it was renamed Reform UK, Richard Tice took over as leader and it became much more marginal. But in an interview on the Today programme this morning Tice claimed that the government’s failure to bring down immigration was presenting it with an opportunity. He told the programme: The British people voted to control immigration, and the government have betrayed the people’s promises. And that’s why so many thousands of people, former Tory members, are joining us. Our polling numbers – we got record polling last week, four different polls where we’re in double figures. This week, we’ve had Tory donors joining us. Frankly, I fully expect Tory MPs who are furious and angry with the government to be calling me next week. Tice said Reform UK wanted a “one in, one out” policy on migration. The latest Politico poll of polls puts Reform UK support at 7%. On this measure, backing for the party has increased marginally in recent months. In his interview on the Today programme this morning Mel Stride, the work and pensions secretary, said he accepted James Cleverly’s claim that he did not refer to Stockton as a “shit-hole” in the Commons at PMQs on Wednesday, but that he did insult the town’s Labour MP. Asked about Cleverly’s version of what was said, which is not believed by the Stockton North MP Alex Cunningham, Stride said: [Cleverly] has made the point that he says that it was not aimed at a particular place. Knowing James well, he’s not the sort of person, in my opinion, who would have made that kind of remark in that kind of context. But he has accepted that this was certainly unparliamentary language and he has rightly apologised. In fact, Cleverly has not apologised in person. Yesterday “a source” close to him told PA Media that Cleverly apologises, which is not quite the same thing. Turning back to immigration, this is from Craig Oliver, David Cameron’s former communications director at No 10. Oliver doesn’t often criticise his old boss in public but it was Cameron who promised, ahead of the 2010 general election, to get annual net migration below 100,000, and Oliver is including him in the last of Tory leaders who have mishandled this issue. The great strategic error of the \\u2066@Conservatives\\u2069 has been telling people repeatedly there are simple solutions to net migration. The 10s of thousands plan, Brexit, Rwanda, now pure panic. It’s time for a grown up conversation on immigration. Coming back to the Times YouGov polling (see 10.06am), the responses to questions about the autumn statement are more significant than the latest voting intention findings. The poll suggests many of the main announcements have strong public support (but not freezing alcohol duties – which may come as a surprise to politicians who assume that’s always a dead-cert vote winner). But, as Oliver Wright reports reports in his story, while voters may have welcomed what Jeremy Hunt was doing, the chancellor did not make them feel more positive about their economic prospects. Wright says: Only 7% said the economy was in a good state, compared with 6% in March, and the number saying it was in a bad state had dropped from 73% to 69%. There was very little optimism about the future. Only 14% thought that the financial situation of their household would get better over the next 12 months compared with 12% in March. The proportion saying it would get worse had dropped, however, from 51% to 41%. When asked about Britain’s economic situation overall 18% thought things would get better over the next year — unchanged since March while 48% thought they would get worse. Asked whether Hunt’s budget measures would make them and their family better off 18% said they would, compared with 15% who said they would be worse off and 55% who said the changes would not make much difference to their circumstances. In an interview at the Nissan plant, Rishi Sunak refused to apologise for the government failing to honour the 2019 Tory manifesto promise to reduce immigration. But he said he did think immigration levels were too high. He said: I’m very clear that the levels of migration are too high, and they’ve got to come down to more sustainable levels. I’ve been clear about that. It’s good to see that the ONS yesterday did say that the levels of migration are now slowing, in their words, which is a welcome step. But we’ve got more to go. That’s why I announced a policy earlier [in May] to clamp down on the number of dependents that students can bring when they’re coming here … That action I took represents the single toughest measure that anyone has taken to bring down the levels of legal migration in a very long time. So that should give people a sense of my commitment to bringing migration down. And if we see further abuse of the system, of course, we’re prepared to act to do more. But when asked if he supported the measures that Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, is reportedly proposing, such as a higher minimum salary threshold for people getting work visas, and a cap on the number of people getting NHS work visas, Sunak refused to answer, and largely just repeated what he had said already (quoted above). Rishi Sunak has described the £2bn investment in the Nissan plant in Sunderland as evidence of the confidence that investors have in the government’s economic strategy. Speaking to the media as he visited the factory with Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, Sunak said: We’ve just had a track record now of company after company committing to the UK … BMW, Stellantis, Tata with their largest investment outside of India that we announced earlier this year, and now here Nissan in Sunderland, our largest car manufacturer. All of them committing money to the UK, building the next generation of electric vehicles here in the UK, creating and safeguarding thousands of jobs across the UK. All of those companies think we’re doing the right thing, they actually welcome the changes that we made in the autumn statement recently to make sure that we cut taxes for businesses like this that are investing. They think we’ve got our strategy right as we approach net zero, and they think this is a fantastic place to be. They’re all voting with their feet. They’re putting money into the country, they’re creating jobs in the country. That’s a huge vote of confidence in this government’s economic strategy. The Times has published a YouGov poll this morning, carried out on Wednesday and Thursday, suggesting support for the Conservatives is up four point on the previous week. It has them on 25%. With Labour unchanged at 44%,still 19 points ahead. In its story, the Times suggests the autumn statement announcements are responsible for this modest boost in Tory popularity. But psephology Twitter isn’t convinced. Will Jennings, an academic, says that talk of a four-point rise is misleading because the last YouGov poll, which had them on 21 points, was an outlier (making it an unreliable benchmark). Another poll out today, from Techne, which was also carried out on Wednesday and Thursday, has picked up no evidence of an autumn statement boost. David Cameron, the foreign secretary, will meet with Palestinian leaders and commit a further £30m in aid for people in Gaza following the announcement of a four-day ceasefire in the conflict in the Middle East, PA Media reports. PA says: The former prime minister is urging “all parties to continue to work towards the release of every hostage” after holding talks with Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and president, Isaac Herzog, during a visit to Israel yesterday. Today he will be in the occupied Palestinian territories, meeting Palestinian leaders and agencies delivering aid in Gaza, advocating adherence to the new agreement on all sides. The ceasefire was due to begin this morning, with aid “going in as soon as possible”, according to Qatari officials. The first set of civilians held captive by Hamas are expected to be freed at about 4pm on Friday local time, including 13 women and children. Cameron said: “We are hopeful that today will see the release of hostages, and I am urging all parties to continue to work towards the release of every hostage. A pause will also allow access for life-saving aid to the people of Gaza. “I am proud that a fourth UK flight carrying critical supplies landed in Egypt today, and I can announce new £30m of funding which will be spent on vital aid such as shelter and medical provisions. “It is vital to protect civilians from harm, and we are urgently looking at all avenues to get aid into Gaza, including land, maritime and air routes.” Good morning. We are expecting to hear from Rishi Sunak this morning. He and Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, are in the north-east of England on a visit linked to the announcement that Nissan is investing £2bn in its plant in Sunderland where three new electric car models will be made. Jasper Jolly has the story. In a statement about this issued this morning, Sunak said: Nissan’s investment is a massive vote of confidence in the UK’s automotive industry, which already contributes a massive £71bn a year to our economy. This venture will no doubt secure Sunderland’s future as the UK’s Silicon Valley for electric vehicle innovation and manufacturing. Making the UK the best place to do business is at the heart of our economic plan. We will continue to back businesses like Nissan to expand and grow their roots in the UK every step of the way as we make the right long term decisions for a brighter future. But it is never easy to get the media to focus primarily on good news, and Sunak is instead likely to face questions about two of the much more tricky questions in his in-tray. First, if No 10 says net migration is “far too high”, what is he going to do about it? As Jamie Grierson reports, following the publication of figures yesterday saying net migration peaked at 745,000 in the year ending December 2022, Conservative MPs are furious and demanding an immediate response. Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, has drawn up plans for further restrictions, including lifting the annual salary required for people getting a work visa to £35,000. The BBC’s Chris Mason has the details. Secondly, the debate about the merits of the autumn statement continues, particularly after the experts yesterday made it very clear that Hunt’s tax cuts are in effect funded by projected spending cuts that may be impossibly tight. As Richard Partington, Kiran Stacey and Phillip Inman report, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says these cuts would be worse than George Osborne’s austerity programme. The government’s response has been to claim that it can cut spending on public services without making them worse by making them more efficient. In interviews this morning, Mel Stride, the work and pensions secretary, rejected claims that the autumn statement meant another round of austerity was coming. He told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: I really don’t see us going into any era of austerity, as you put it. I think there are two important points here. One is that in the autumn statement, the chancellor came forward with the kind of long-term thinking and actions now that will lead to greater business investment and growth in the economy going forward. For example, the 100% full expensing for investments makes us the most competitive destination for businesses out of the G7 and across the OECD. But secondly, we have to look at productivity. Public services aren’t all about just constantly spending ever more money. It is about the outputs. So John Glen [Cabinet Office minister], one of my very capable colleagues, and others across government, are absolutely engaged in a mission to improve productivity across the public sector. I believe it is the case that if we were to increase productivity by 0.5% for example, there wouldn’t be any further pressure on increases in taxes. So I think there is a huge amount we can do through productivity and investing in the long-term to get that growth going. We are expecting to hear from Sunak this morning. Otherwise, it looks quiet. The Commons is not sitting, and the diary is pretty empty. But David Cameron, the new foreign secretary, is still in the Middle East where today he will be in the occupied Palestinian territories, meeting Palestinian leaders and agencies delivering aid to Gaza.

       "     'bodyText': 'Net migration boosted the UK population by a record 745,000 in the year to December 2022, fuelled in part by a surge in overseas professionals arriving to work in the NHS and care homes and prompting a furious response from rightwing Conservatives. The former home secretary Suella Braverman called the figures “a slap in the face to the British public” and called for much tougher visa restrictions and an annual cap on net migration. (See 4.09pm.) The Labour MP Alex Cunningham has said that he does not accept James Cleverly’s claim that, in the Commons yesterday, he did not call Stockton a “shit-hole”, but he did call Cunningham, one of its MPs, a “shit”. The home secretary issued this account of what happened after Ben Houchen, the Tory Tees Valley mayor, joined Labour MPs saying Cleverly should apologise for his slur on the town. (See 2.20pm.) Cunningham told Radio 4’s PM programme he did not believe Cleverly’s new version of what happend and that people had seen the minister describe the town as a “shit-hole”. He went on: I want an apology for the people of my community who are really upset about this. As Mark Brown reports, Cleverly’s comment has provoked fury in the town. But Houchen has welcomed Cleverly’s apology, describing him as “a good guy who made a mistake”. I’m pleased James Cleverly has apologised for using unparliamentary language Whatever was said, the speculation dragged Stockton’s name through the mud, which is unacceptable We’re all human &amp; he’s a good guy who made a mistake Now let’s get back to building Teesside British households are on course to be worse off at the end of a parliamentary term for the first time in modern history, leading economists have warned, after Jeremy Hunt’s £20bn autumn statement tax cuts favoured the richest 20% of earners. Jeremy Hunt has said he did not opt for “crowd-pleasing taxes” in his autumn statement as a pre-election giveaway, adding the government’s “long-term goal” is to boost the economy. The Scottish health secretary, Michael Matheson, is to be investigated by Holyrood authorities over the near-£11,000 bill racked up on his work iPad. A reader asks: Regarding the immigration numbers it would be interesting to know how many are students and how many have come to work in the NHS. Is there anywhere where these numbers are available or (and this wouldn’t surprise me) do the government not know? These figures are all in the ONS report. It says study is the biggest reason for non-EU immigration. The largest contributor to non-EU immigration (39%) was study, which was largely unchanged compared with YE June 22; however, while historic evidence has shown that more than 80% of students typically left within 5 years, analysis of more recent cohorts is suggesting that more are staying for longer and transitioning onto work visas … Those immigrating long-term on study-related visas (main applicants and dependants) made up 39% of non-EU long-term immigration at 378,000 in the YE June 2023. This is an increase from 320,000 in the YE June 2022. This increase is mainly attributed to dependants (from 58,000 in YE June 2022 to 96,000 in YE June 2023). The Home Office’s statistics report, Why do people come to the UK? To study, suggests that this is because of an increase in the number of visas granted to dependants from Nigeria and India. The increase in the number of people coming to the UK to study in the last two years may partly be reflected in the attraction of the new Graduate visa route. This visa route allows international students to apply to work in the UK for at least two years after completing their studies. But it also says that it is the increase in people coming to work is what has been driving the overall increase in non-EU immigration. The increase in non-EU immigration in the YE June 2023 was mainly driven by migrants coming for work (up to 33% from 23% in YE June 2022), largely attributed to those coming on health and care visas; in contrast, those arriving on humanitarian routes decreased from 19% to 9% over the same period … Those immigrating long-term on work-related visas (main applicants and dependants) made up 33% of non-EU long-term immigration in the YE June 2023, with an estimated 322,000 arrivals. This is compared with 198,000 in YE June 2022. This is split fairly evenly between main applicants (169,000) and dependants (154,000). The Home Office’s statistics report, Why do people come to the UK? To work, shows growth in long-term sponsored work visas following the introduction of the “Skilled Worker” and “Skilled Worker - Health and Care” visas in 2020. Health and Care work visas were the most common type of work visa that dependants came to the UK on and is driving the increase in immigration of those on work dependant visas (from 86,000 in YE June 2022 to 154,000 in YE June 2023). Kemi Badenoch told the Covid inquiry additional funding would not have stopped ethnic minorities being disproportionately affected by Covid. The equalities minister insisted: Being an ethnic minority was not the cause of being disproportionately impacted. It correlated with what the causes were – the co-morbidities. So you have to tackle the actual cause, not the thing that comes in common with it. There was no perfect way of finding a particular group to give extra cash to. And extra cash, in and of itself, would not have solved the problem which you were trying to resolve of trying to make sure people were protected and away from the virus. Questioning her, Prof Leslie Thomas KC, of the Federation of Ethnic Minority Healthcare Organisations, argued “structural inequalities” could have been one of the causes, including poverty and discrimination. But Badenoch said there was no “silver bullet” to resolving such issues, noting her team had not found structural inequalities in the research they undertook. She said: In terms of the issues around deprivation, poverty – a lot of work was done to look at what we could do to fix that but we can’t cure diabetes, we can’t remove poverty. Reflecting on the broader levels of financial support given during the pandemic, she said it was inevitable some people felt excluded. “There will always be people who feel that they’re on the wrong side” regardless of where the boundary was drawn on support, she said. Reflecting on what more could have been done to mitigate the disproportionate impact of Covid on disabled people and ethnic minorities, Badenoch said “joining forces” with the disabilities minister wouldn’t have made a difference. She went as far as saying it was not possible to prepare for the pandemic, or have a government response ready. I think just because you’re looking at things separately doesn’t mean there’s a hierarchy of needs. The evidence showed that disabled people were more impacted and we were keen to ensure that it was the people who were most impacted that got the most attention. Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former business secretary, told Radio 4’s The World at One that he was “embarrassed” as a Conservative by today’s net migration figures, which show the party is failing to keep the promise it made at the 2019 election. (See 11.33am.) He said: This is a phenomenally high level with economic consequences … I’m embarrassed that we haven’t achieved what we set out to achieve. Rees-Mogg said the level of legal migration was a more serious problem than people crossing the Channel on small boats. “In terms of the numbers, the small boats is a distraction,” he said. Asked if he agreed with Suella Braverman’s call for a cap on net migration numbers (see 4.06pm), Rees-Mogg said that this would be one way of reducing the numbers. And when it was put to him that the UK needed to allow foreign workers to come to the country to pick fruit, he said he didn’t agree. He explained: We don’t need fruit pickers. If fruit can be grown more cheaply and more economically in foreign countries, we should import fruit and focus on our competitive advantage. Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, has described today’s immigration figures as “a slap in the face to the British public”. She is calling for much tougher visa restrictions and an annual cap on net migration. She has made her comments in a short thread on X starting here. Today’s record migration stats show we’ve let in an extra million people in just 2 years, a population equivalent to Birmingham. The pressure on housing, the NHS, schools, wages, and community cohesion, is unsustainable. When do we say: enough is enough? 1\/3 We were elected on a pledge to reduce net migration, which was 229k in 2019. Today’s record numbers are a slap in the face to the British public who have voted to control and reduce migration at every opportunity. We must act now to reduce migration to sustainable levels. 2\/3 Brexit gave us the tools. It’s time to use them. As HS I pushed to: - Put an annual cap on net migration; - Raise the salary threshold to £45k (excluding health &amp; social care); - Close the graduate visa route; - Cap health &amp; social care visas; - Limit dependents on all visas. 3\/3 Kemi Badenoch, the business and trade secretary, has said the government is not doing enough to combat online misinformation. She made the comment to the Covid inquiry, where she was giving evidence today in her role as minister for women and equalities. Referring to misinformation that spread during the pandemic, she said: I say this, even as a constituency MP, the number of people who come up to me in the street and tell me that I am part of a grand conspiracy to infect them, and ‘so-and-so died’ because of the material that we were putting out. I don’t think government has got a handle on dealing with misinformation. I don’t think that we have adapted to this age of social media where information travels at lightning speed across the world. I don’t know how we solve it, but in terms of gaps, I think there is a lesson in the pandemic that this is an area that needs some addressing. Badenoch said she has heard there is a lot of work going on in departments on the issue, but added: “I don’t see it.” Referring to deaths during the pandemic, Badenoch also said that, if ethnicity had been recorded on death certificates, the disproportionate impact of Covid on ethnic minority people might have come to light sooner. She said: One of the recommendations I think that would have come in an earlier report was even about recording ethnicity on death certificates, which was something that we discovered was not being done and was a big issue. I felt that if we had had that – I don’t know why it wasn’t recorded, I don’t know if there was ever a reason, it was just something that wasn’t recorded – if we had had that, we might, not certainly, but we might have been able to spot the disproportionate impact a little bit earlier. In the light of today’s ONS figures, Rob Ford, the politics professor who co-wrote Brexitland, one of the best books on the electoral trends explaining the vote to leave the EU, has posted a good thread on Twitter about attitudes to immigration. He says public support for restrictions on immigration has fallen significantly. The thread starts here. A few slides from my recent lecture on long term trends in immigration attitudes which may be pertinent today: 1. Though migration is at record highs, the LT trend in public support for restricting migration is *downwards* And here are some of his posts. All of this represents a *huge* shift in the politics of immigration now compared to a decade or two ago. Opposition to immigration is *lower*, immigration is *less salient* and concern about it is now more concentrated in particular political and social groups Instead, immigration has become a “wedge issue” for the Conservatives. They cannot ignore intense concern about it among about half of their current base. But talking about it constantly risks looking out of touch with swing voters who don’t prioritise it or see it positively. Tl;dr - immigration remains a polarising issue. But that doesn’t mean the politics of immigration in 2024 will be like the politics of immigration in 2001-2016. The landscape of opinion has changed dramatically in the last decade. James Cleverly, the home secretary, has suggested that he was misheard in the Commons yesterday, saying that while he did call a Labour MP “shit”, he did not describe the MP’s constituency as a “shit-hole”. He will be hoping that his revised explanation ends a row that escalated this afternoon when Ben Houchen, the Conservative Tees Valley mayor, joined Labour MPs in saying Cleverly should apologise for his remarks about Stockton. (See 2.20pm.) The row started when Labour’s Alex Cunningham asked why child poverty was so high in his constituency during PMQs yesterday. Labour MPs believe that, as Rishi Sunak was getting up to respond officially, Cleverly, who was sitting beside him, said it was because the town was a “shit-hole”. In response to the accusation, a spokesperson for Cleverly said yesterday: “He did not say that, and would not. He’s disappointed people would accuse him of doing so.” This afternoon a source close to Cleverly told PA Media his off-the-cuff remark in the Commons had been directed at the MP, rather than his constituency. The source said: James made a comment. He called Alex Cunningham a shit MP. He apologises for unparliamentary language. As was made clear yesterday, he would never criticise Stockton. He’s campaigned in Stockton and is clear that it is a great place. Ben Houchen, the Conservative Tees Valley mayor, has joined Labour MPs in saying James Cleverly, the home secretary, should apologise for calling Stockton a shit-hole during PMQs yesterday. Cleverly, through a spokesperson, has denied using the remark. But his critics believe his voice can be heard on the recording of MPs heckling Labour’s Alex Cunningham, who represents Stockton North, after he asked a question yesterday about poverty in the town. In a statement posted on X, which shows Houchen does not accept Cleverly’s denial, Houchen says: It is clear to me that the home secretary, James Cleverley, should apologise for dragging Stockton’s name through the mud … This type of language only furthers the outdated and inaccurate stereotypes we’ve battled for years … Childish and unprofessional language used by Westminster politicians, who should know better, does nothing to help our plans for progress. Keir Starmer has described today’s net migration figures, showing it at 745,000 in the year to December 2022 (a figure that has been revised upwards) and 672,000 in the year to June 2023, as “shockingly high”. Echoing language used by Yvette Cooper (see 1.07pm), Starmer said: That figure is shockingly high. It represents a failure, not just of immigration, but also of asylum and of the economy. Because within that figure there’s a huge increase in work visas, which shows the government hasn’t done what it needs to do on skills. Within that number there are a rising number of asylum seekers and disclosure that the hotel bills are going up and up. Keir Starmer has said that the autumn statement won’t stop people getting poorer over the course of this parliament. Speaking to broadcasters on a visit to Essex, he said: Whichever way the government tried to spin the autumn statement, the reality is that living standards are dropping, the tax burden is going up and that disposable income at the end of this government is going to be less than it was at the beginning for ordinary working people. That’s worth thinking about. That means people will have less money in their pocket at the end of this government than they had at the beginning. [See 12.48pm.] Starmer also said a Labour government would have “tough choices” to make on public spending if it came to power. But he said the party had plans to raise funds through some tax rises that it has announced, and he said Labour would champion growth. If we are privileged enough to come into power, I don’t underestimate the challenges that we will face because of the 13 years of failure that we’ve already had. That will require tough choices. But we have already said where we will increase tax … The underlying answer has to be about economic growth. And if you’re going to have economic growth, you need a realisable plan that’s worked with business to make it actually work. The government says it wants growth, but just look at the forecast they’ve got after 13 years of near negligible growth. They’ve now got a forecast that it’s not going to grow very much in the future. Labour says today’s ONS figures show “the scale of utter Tory failure on immigration”. This is from Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary. Today’s net migration statistics, including a 65% increase in net migration for work, show the scale of utter Tory failure on immigration, asylum and the economy. These figures are driven by a 54% increase in work visas and a 156% increase in health and social care visas which prove the Conservatives’ abysmal record on skills, training and workforce planning, as they have run our economy into the ground. They are still failing to make changes Labour has called for to end the 20% wage discount in the immigration system and to link it to training requirements. Downing Street has said that net migration is “far too high”. Commenting on today’s figures from the ONS, the PM’s spokesperson said the government was working to bring numbers down, but he said there was “much more to do”. He told reporters at the lobby briefing: Net migration remains far too high. That’s why we are taking action to bring it down. That is what the British public expect. That’s why in May we announced the toughest-ever action to reduce migration. That includes clamping down on the roughly 150,000 dependants of students who come into the UK every year and introducing an additional immigration health surcharge and raising visa costs. We know this is predicted to lead to significant reductions. As we’ve seen today, the ONS figures show migration is now reducing year on year [see 10.06am], but we believe there is much more to do. Where the system is being abused, we will leave no stone unturned in rooting that out so companies and individuals cannot exploit our system. Asked why the government did not just issue fewer visas, the spokesperson said it was important to “strike the right balance” and that it was necessary to allow foreign workers in to address “short-term pressures” in areas, such as health and social care. He went on: It is important that we take the time to consider carefully how we approach this, given the importance that a number of migrants can contribute – whether that’s to our health and care sector, or elsewhere to the wider economy. We do believe there is further to go here and that’s why we’re keeping it under review. In its own report on the autumn statement, the Resolution Foundation thinktank says this will be the first parliament on record in which household incomes in real terms will be lower at the end than at the beginning. (See 9.02am.) Here is the chart illustrating this. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has also published a distributional impact of the autumn statement. Confirming what other researchers have said, it shows that the measures announced yesterday (the green bars on the graph – cuts to national insurance contributions and the increase in local housing allowance rates) benefit the richest households most. But, if all tax and benefit measures from April 2019 are included, the poorest 10% of households have gained most. (In fact, the poorest 10% of households are the only group that have gained overall. But the changes have been progressive, in that wealthier households have lost out more – both proportionally and in cash terms – than poorer ones.) Turning back to the Institute for Fiscal Studies’ assessment of the autumn statement, it says that Jeremy Hunt’s tax cuts yesterday return less than £1 to taxpayers for every extra £4 they are paying because of tax rises since 2021. Another way of putting that would be to say that, for every £1 the Treasury has taken, less than 25p is coming back under yesterday’s measures. This is from the analysis by the IFS’s Robert Joyce. The headline measures in this autumn statement were cuts to the rates of national insurance contributions for employees and the self-employed. Taken in isolation, these put money back into the pockets of almost 30 million workers at a cost of around £10 billion per year, with anyone earning at least £12,570, or making profits of at least £6,725, per year benefitting. The bigger picture is that these changes give back less than £1 of every £4 that is being taken away from households through changes to NICs and income tax announced since March 2021. Those takeaways are far less transparent than the smaller giveaway announced today - implemented as they are through multi-year freezes to income tax and NICs thresholds, which gradually bring more and more people into higher tax brackets, and especially so at a time of high inflation. Labour wants David Cameron to reveal the extent of his links to a Chinese-backed enterprise, PA Media reports. PA says: Labour has questioned reports of the foreign secretary’s links to a Sri Lankan port development and its ties with the Chinese government. MPs also continued to question the Tory peer’s role in the Greensill affair, in which he privately lobbied ministers in an attempt to win access for the now-collapsed financial firm to an emergency coronavirus loan scheme. During Cabinet Office questions in the Commons, Labour’s Pat McFadden asked who the “ultimate client” was for Cameron’s “role in promoting the Port City Colombo project in Sri Lanka”, and if it was a company owned by the Chinese state. The project is part of China’s global infrastructure strategy, the belt and road initiative, with Chinese companies involved in its construction. The Cabinet Office minister John Glen replied: “This isn’t a matter for me. This is a matter for the processes that I have set out which have been complied with. And I believe Lord Cameron has made some comments with respect to those matters.” McFadden had earlier asked “whether all benefits in kind received by the foreign secretary while he acted as a lobbyist for Greensill Capital have been properly declared”, and whether the former prime minister’s tax affairs were examined and considered by the House of Lords appointments commission before his peerage was approved. Glen replied: “I’m not going to comment on media speculation … Lord Cameron’s appointment followed all the established processes for both peerages and ministerial appointments. The ennoblement was approved by the House of Lords appointments commission in the usual way, and that included a check with HMRC.” The New Conservatives, a group of rightwing Tory MPs co-chaired by Miriam Cates and Danny Kruger, have expressed alarm about today’s net migration figure. In a statement, the group says that this is a “do or die” moment for the Tories and that Rishi Sunak should publish plans to show how the party will get net migration below 229,000, the level it was at the time of the last election, when reducing migration was a Tory manifesto promise. The New Conservatives say this must happen by the next election, which must be held by January 2025 at the latest. They say: For the Treasury, there may be reasonable arguments for increasing immigration – because more people translates into more recorded economic activity – but the truth is the public won’t accept it. Our voters can tell the difference between real economic growth that improves the standard of living for ordinary households, and the phantom ‘growth’ that importing ever more people puts on a Treasury spreadsheet. High rates of immigration depress wages, reduce investment in skills and technology, put unsustainable pressure on housing and public services, and threaten community cohesion. The word ‘existential’ has been used a lot in recent days but this really is ‘do or die’ for our party. Each of us made a promise to the electorate. We don’t believe that such promises can be ignored. The government must propose, today, a comprehensive package of measures to meet the manifesto promise by the time of the next election. We will assess any such package and report publicly on whether it will meet the promise made to the electorate. The New Conservatives include prominent supporters of Suella Braverman, the former home secretary who has herself criticised Sunak for not doing enough to bring down immigration. The Covid inquiry has announced its timetable for hearings next week. Matt Hancock, the former health secretary, who has been repeatedly accused by witnesses to the inquiry of giving false assurances to colleagues, is due to give evidence for a day and a half, starting on Thursday. And Michael Gove, who as Cabinet Office minister at the time was one of the lead ministers dealing with Covid, is due to give evidence for most of Tuesday. Sajid Javid, another former health secretary, and Dominic Raab, foreign secretary and first secretary of state during most of the Covid crisis, and stand-in PM when Boris Johnson was ill, are due to appear on Wednesday. Here is the full schedule. This timetable suggests Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak may appear the following week. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has released its full assessment of the autumn statement. In his summary, Paul Johnson, the IFS director, says Jeremy Hunt’s tax cuts are “paid for by planned real cuts in public service spending” which are not credible. He says this means Hunt has left a huge problem for whoever is chancellor after the next election. He explains: The net result is that Mr Hunt is, by the narrowest of tiny margins, still on course to meet his (poorly designed) fiscal rule that debt as a fraction of national income should be falling in the last year of the forecast period. In reality debt is set to be just about flat at around 93 per cent of national income over the whole period. And that is on the basis of a series of questionable, if not plain implausible, assumptions. It assumes that many aspects of day to day public service spending will be cut. It assumes a substantial real cut in public investment spending. It assumes that rates of fuel duties will rise year on year with inflation – which they have not done in more than a decade and they surely will not do next April. It assumes that the constant roll over of “temporary” business rates cuts will stop. It assumes, of course, that the economy doesn’t suffer any negative shocks. Like his predecessors Mr Hunt has taken a modest improvement in the public finance forecasts and spent most of it. He has spent up front and told us he will meet his targets largely by unspecified fiscal restraint at some point in the future. What he will do in March if the OBR downgrades its forecasts we do not know. Any such downgrading would leave him with a big headache. More importantly he or his successor is going to have the mother and father of a headache when it comes to making the tough decisions implied by this statement in a year or two’s time. And here is Johnson’s conclusion. The fiscal forecasts have not in any real sense got better. Debt is not declining over time. Taxes are still heading to record levels. Spending is also due to stay high by historic standards, not least because of high debt interest payments. But those payments plus pressures on health and pension spending mean current plans are for some pretty serious cuts across other areas of public spending. How did Mr Hunt afford tax cuts when real economic forecasts got no better? He banked additional revenue from higher inflation, and pencilled in harsher cuts to public spending. I’m not sure I’d want to be the chancellor inheriting this fiscal situation in a year’s time. David Cameron, the new foreign secretary, is in Israel, where he visited Kibbutz Be’eri, the scene of one of the Hamas massacres last month. He said: I wanted to come here to see it for myself; I have heard and seen things I will never forget. Today is also a day where we hope to see progress on the humanitarian pause. This is a crucial opportunity to get hostages out and aid in to Gaza, to help Palestinian civilians who are facing a growing humanitarian crisis. As PA Media reports, Cameron’s visit comes a day after he met counterparts from Arab and Islamic countries – including the Palestinian Authority – at Lancaster House in London to discuss the Middle East crisis. Foreign ministers from Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Turkey, Indonesia and Nigeria, as well as the secretary general of the League of Arab States and the ambassador of Qatar, attended the event. Cameron said the group discussed how to use the planned pause in the Israel-Hamas fighting to consider “how we can build a peaceful future which provides security for Israel but also peace and stability for the Palestinian people”. Here is the Office for National Statistics’ report on migration figures. (See 9.33am.) Here is an extract from the ONS’s summary. It puts the latest annual net migration figure at 672,000, but says provisional figures suggest this is starting to fall from a record high. That would be due to immigration falling and emigration rising, it says. The provisional estimate of total long-term immigration for year ending (YE) June 2023 was 1.2 million, while emigration was 508,000, meaning that net migration was 672,000; most people arriving to the UK in the YE June 2023 were non-EU nationals (968,000), followed by EU (129,000) and British (84,000). Net migration for YE June 2023 was 672,000, which is slightly higher compared with YE June 2022 (607,000) but down on our updated estimate for YE December 2022 (745,000); while it is too early to say if this is the start of a new downward trend, these more recent estimates indicate a slowing of immigration coupled with increasing emigration. Methods for measuring international migration are in development, and these timely estimates for year ending June 2023 and December 2022 are provisional, supported by assumptions that are informed by past behaviour; this means the uncertainty associated with these estimates will reduce in our next releases, when we have more data to confirm people’s long-term migration status. Before the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, migration was relatively stable, but patterns and behaviours have been shifting considerably since then; net migration increased sharply since 2021 because of a rise in non-EU immigration driven by a range of factors including those arriving on humanitarian routes (including Ukrainian and British national (overseas) schemes), as well as an increase in non-EU students and workers. And here is a table from the report. Jeremy Hunt does not seem to have any qualms about the Conservative party misleadingly saying taxes are going down, when the tax burden is going up. (See 9.31am.) But there is something about which he feels “incredibly guilty”. He told LBC this morning that, despite starting his autumn statement speech with a reference to it being his wife’s birthday, he did not get round to buying her a present – or even a card. He said: I’m afraid I have not bought anything for my wife. I didn’t even get her a birthday card. I feel incredibly guilty. What I did was publicly acknowledge her birthday to millions of people, which is something I haven’t done before. So, hopefully I will be able to make up for that at the weekend. PA Media has just snapped this. Estimated net migration to the UK stood at a provisional 672,000 in the year to June 2023, up from 607,000 in the previous 12 months but below a revised record figure of 745,000 in the year to December 2022, the Office for National Statistics said. Yesterday the Conservative party released an advert in history saying Jeremy Hunt had announced “the biggest tax cut in British history”. In an interview on the Today programme, Nick Robinson put it to Jeremy Hunt that this was “downright misleading” given the fact that the tax burden is at a record high. Hunt rejected this. He replied: No. We’ve been very clear and upfront that we’ve had to take difficult decisions to increase taxes to pay down our Covid debt. But we are starting now to bring taxes down again. That is very significant. In his analysis of the autumn statement, Larry Elliott, the Guardian’s economics editor, described it as “a classic ‘live now, pay later’ ploy in which pre-election tax cuts are paid for by implausibly tough public spending plans in future years”. Larry is referring to the way the autumn statement includes spending plans for the future which have not gone up in line with inflation. Most experts think they are unrealistic because they think in practice a future chancellor will have to spend more to stop public services collapsing. In an interview with Times Radio, Hunt defended his spending plans. “We do need to be disciplined in public spending in the short run,” he said. But he claimed that this approach was necessary to stimulate growth. And when it was put to him that his spending plans would lead to public services getting worse, he said he did not accept that. He explained: No, and the reason is very straightforward. If we want to have money to invest in the NHS, in schools, in our armed forces over the longer term, you have to grow the economy. That is the only way in the longer run that you can fund the cost of an ageing population and that’s why I took those decisions for the long term. In the short run, I am showing discipline with public spending. I think that is the right thing to do. We need a more productive state, not a bigger state. Jeremy Hunt may claim that his autumn statement wasn’t influenced by election timing (see 8.43am), but that’s not the view of the Resolution Foundation. The thinktank has now published its analysis of the autumn statement and its title is: “A pre-election Statement”. Here is a summary from Torsten Bell, the RF’s chief executive. Jeremy Hunt yesterday got his pre-election giveaways in early, with an autumn statement offering tax cuts today, at the price of implausible spending cuts tomorrow. Well-targeted specifics, addressing problems such as our tax system’s bias against working-age earnings or benefit system’s failure to keep pace with fast-rising rents, were juxtaposed with far less well-designed big picture fiscal choices. Tax-cutting rhetoric clashed with tax-rising reality, and positive steps to encourage business investment combined with a growth-sapping hit to public investment. Ultimately this reflects the pressures, not only of an upcoming election, but of governing a sicker, older, slower-growing Britain, amidst an era of far higher interest rates. That might be difficult for policy makers, but it’s a disaster for households whose wages are stuck in a totally unprecedented 20-year stagnation. This parliament is set to achieve a truly grim new record: the first in which household incomes will be lower at its end than its beginning. The thinktank says the fall in the value of real household incomes over the course of this parliament will work out at £1,900 on average in real terms. It says: The biggest inflation shock in four decades, and taxes rising to their highest level in eight decades, means the outlook for living standards remains dire. Real household disposable income per person is expected to fall by 1.5 per cent in 2024 – presenting a bleak economic backdrop to the 2024 election. The last time RHDI fell in an election year was 50 years ago, in 1974. This helps drive a new grim record on living standards: this parliament is on track to be the first in which real household disposable incomes actually fall (by 3.1 per cent from December 2019 to January 2025): households will, on average, be £1,900 poorer at the end of this parliament than at its start. The RF also says that around 40% of the gains from the tax and benefit measures announced yesterday will go to the richest fifth of the population. Graeme Wearden has more on this on his business live blog. Good morning. The tax cuts in Jeremy Hunt’s autumn statement yesterday were larger than expected and, unusually, the national insurance cut will take effect from January, not April, when tax cuts or tax rises are normally implemented. Inevitably, that prompted speculation at Westminster that Hunt was preparing for an early election. But in an interview this morning Hunt claimed it was “silly” to view his tax cuts as a pre-election giveaway. He told Sky News: We haven’t chosen the most populist tax cuts. I think it’s silly to think about this in terms of the timing of the next election. We’re trying to make the right decisions for the long-term growth of the British economy. Hunt also claimed he had not even discussed election timing with the PM. He told LBC: I can confirm regarding the date of the election that I’ve had absolutely no discussions with the prime minister. Those are some of the lines from Hunt’s morning interview round. I will post a full summary shortly. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: The ONS publishes its latest migration figures. 9.30am: Prof Dame Angela McLean, the government’s chief scientific adviser, gives evidence to the Covid inquiry. At 2pm Kemi Badenoch is due to give evidence as minister for women and equalities. 10.30am: The Institute for Fiscal Studies publishes its assessment of the autumn statement. Morning: Jeremy Hunt is on a visit in Wrexham. Morning: Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, are on a visit in Essex. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 12.30pm: Richard Hughes, chair of the Office for Budget Responsibility, speaks at an Institute for Government event. Afternoon: Rishi Sunak is on a visit in Yorkshire. If you want to contact me, do try the “send us a message” feature.

Here is a roundup of our coverage of the day’s events Jeremy Hunt’s autumn statement tax cuts fuel talk of spring election Key points at a glance Political analysis Chancellor’s tax cut opens door to early election – and sets a trap for Labour | Rowena Mason Business analysis A ‘live now, pay later’ autumn statement – and yet election year still looks bleak | Larry Elliott Conservative MPs urge Jeremy Hunt to go further on tax cuts Thousands on disability benefits to lose extra £5,000 a year in autumn statement Sketch Jeremy Hunt delivers a budget designed to destroy a future chancellor | John Crace What it means for you How will your income change? The head of a childcare company backed by the prime minister’s wife has attacked the government following the autumn statement, accusing ministers of letting nurseries go bust, writes Kiran Stacey and Alexandra Topping. Rachel Carrell, chief executive of Koru Kids, criticised a failure to allocate extra money for the childcare sector despite many providers saying that they could go out of business under reforms brought in earlier this year. Jeremy Hunt announced at the budget in March that he would allow more parents to benefit from 30 free hours of childcare, extending the offer to children aged nine months and over. The chancellor allocated £4bn to pay for the expanded offer, but many providers have said this will not be enough to prevent them going bankrupt. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, unveiled plans that could eventually give UK workers one pension pot for life – but there were warnings that it could be an administrative “nightmare”. The shake-up is aimed at tackling the problem of millions of small pension pots being generated – which often then end up being forgotten about – as savers change jobs during their working lives. The Treasury said it was launching a call for evidence on a “lifetime provider” model that would simplify the market by allowing savers to ask employers to pay into one portable pension pot. The pot could be moved from one job to the next. The Treasury said the measure would provide savers with “greater agency and control over their pension”. Responding to the announcement, Rachel Vahey, head of policy development at investment platform AJ Bell, said: “Some estimates suggest the average worker changes employer around 11 times during their career, with each job hop potentially creating a new pension with a new provider.” Jeremy Hunt said he would look to cut income tax at the next budget “if it is responsible to do so”. Asked whether taxes were going up or down under the current government, the Chancellor told Sky News: “We haven’t got to the end of the Parliament yet, so I can’t answer that question. “But what I can say is that my commitment to voters is that, when I had a chance to lighten the tax burden… I’m a Conservative, I believe in doing so. “We have made a start. I don’t pretend, I’ve never pretended that we were going to get there in one go. “But what we can say is that, now we’ve halved inflation, the economy has turned a corner, we can focus on the long-term growth, raising incomes and salaries for families up and down the country.” Asked whether income tax could be cut in the spring budget, Hunt said: “What I will do is exactly what I’ve done this time. If it is responsible to do so, if we can do so without increasing borrowing, then of course as a Conservative, I would like to bring down the tax burden. “But I will only do so in a responsible way and one that doesn’t fuel inflation after the great success we’ve had in halving it.” Jeremy Hunt has paved the way for a renewed period of “implausible austerity” after announcing deep real-terms cuts to public spending after the next election. Hunt has projected day-to-day departmental expenditure increasing by an average of just 0.9% in real terms from 2025, with public investment spending fixed in cash terms, leaving a future government with a “stark choice” between further tax rises or making deep cuts to public services. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) appeared to cast doubt on the feasibility of the government’s tight post-election spending plans in its assessment of the chancellor’s autumn statement. The OBR warned persistently high inflation would slash the real value of government departmental spending by £19.1bn by 2027-28, compared with its estimates from the spring. The watchdog made clear that would “present challenges”, including for local councils. It pointed to the fact that demand for public services is expected to grow and warned that local authorities’ abilities to borrow and spend would be constrained. Two thirds (67%) of UK adults support the National Insurance rate cut from 12% to 10% announced in today’s Autumn Statement, with just one in eight (12%) opposing it, according to a snap reactions poll from Savanta. The poll, conducted in the wake of the Chancellor’s statement to the House of Commons, finds a majority (58%) broadly support the package of policies announced by the Chancellor today, including almost three-quarters (72%) of those that voted Conservative in 2019. However, despite the popular package announced today, almost half (49%) of all UK adults disagree with the Chancellor’s assertion that the government’s economic plan for the country is working, including a third (35%) of 2019 Conservative voters. Speaking in a pre-recorded interview on Peston, which airs on ITV1 at 10.45pm today, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt MP admitted his new measures for growth would take a long time to kick in. “The supply side measures, the measures that will boost investment in the economy by businesses, which is the way we get productivity, salaries, living standards up, they will take a decade to happen.” Asked about the OBR downgrading its prediction for the UK’s growth rate to 1.6 percent, Hunt implied it had been too optimistic previously, saying: “Well, in fairness, the OBR were the most optimistic of all the forecasters. They’ve just changed their growth rate to the average of other forecasts.” Christine Espley, a self-employed 61-year-old chef and caterer from Cirencester, has been unable to work since the summer because of extreme mobility issues. She has been waiting 47 weeks for a hip operation and fears she may lose her small benefit income because of planned changes to the welfare system. People with mobility and mental health problems will be asked to work from home or lose benefits as part of what a UK government minister described this week as doing “their duty”. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, doubled down on the controversial policy in his autumn statement on Wednesday, claiming that the government’s so-called back-to-work plan would help nearly 700,000 people with health conditions find work. In December last year, Espley was referred to a consultant who agreed that hip replacement surgery was necessary. “I’ve been waiting for 47 weeks,” she said. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said he accepted it is “going to take time” to reduce the overall tax burden. The senior Conservative made the comment when it was put to him that taxes for some people would still rise due to tax thresholds remaining frozen, despite national insurance being cut in the autumn statement. He told Sky News: “If you’re trying to say that it is going to take time to get taxes down to the levels they were, then I agree. “But what I said was that, when it was responsible to do so, when it wouldn’t affect inflation, I would make a start. “We have done that today and we are a party that believes that, if we want to grow the economy, then we need to have a lightly taxed economy. “And we have made a step which, by the way, for someone on average earnings is going to be about £450, so it is not insignificant.” Jeremy Hunt has gone from “hero to zero on social care”, according to campaigners who branded the absence of any new funding commitments to the struggling sector “shameful”. The only mention of social care in this week’s autumn statement was to “reaffirm” the commitments made at the 2022 statement, when the government pledged to make available up to £14.1 billion for the NHS and adult social care. Age UK noted the 2019 pledge by then-prime minister Boris Johnson to “fix the crisis in social care once and for all” and said Wednesday’s statement was “a reminder of how desperately short the government has fallen”. The Carers Trust said it was “shameful” than none of 110 measures announced by the Chancellor “gets anywhere near easing a social care crisis that is causing so much suffering for so many”. Carers UK described it as “bitterly disappointing that the government has – yet again – failed to acknowledge the devastating impact the lack of funding for health and social care services is having on millions of unpaid carers supporting older and disabled family members”. Meanwhile, the Children’s Charities Coalition, which includes Barnardo’s, The Children’s Society, National Children’s Bureau and NSPCC, said young people are being “left behind in the UK” as they urged a significant investment in children’s social care. George Osborne, the Conservative former chancellor, thinks Jeremy Hunt’s autumn statement is partly about making a May general election an option. But Osborne does not necessarily think it will happen. This is what he said today on his Political Currency podcast with Ed Balls. A lot of people … are going to conclude that [this makes a May election more likely.] And for this reason, [Hunt has] delivered a tax cut and he’s insisted that it’s taking effect from January. In other words, you’re going to start to feel the effects by May. He’s not cut income tax, which leaves open a cut in income tax in a spring budget, and the Conservatives now know, if the forecasts are right, that they’re not going to be fighting the election in the autumn against a backdrop of an improving economy and falling inflation. In fact, things are going to feel pretty stagnant next year. I had already detected and picked up talk of potentially an earlier election. At least as an option. Because they’ve got other issues as well. The Rwanda judgments and all of that. The longer they leave it might make it worse. Personally, I think any prime minister may think they might want to go to the country in May. But when they are 20-odd points behind in the polls and assuming that hasn’t changed dramatically by May, they’re going to go, ‘maybe I’ll wait till the autumn or maybe even wait till the beginning of 2025’ …. But I’ll tell you what Jeremy Hunt is doing. He is following the Lynton Crosby law, which is: you can’t fatten the pig on market day. Lynton Crosby is the Tory election strategist of previous elections who told us as MPs – I remember I was a pretty young MP in 2005 – that you can’t just fire all your ammunition at the general election, you have to make your party attractive and you need to make people feel the benefits of your policies in the many, many months in the run up to that election. So I think Jeremy Hunt is opening the door to a May election, even though I think it’s unlikely Rishi Sunak will walk through it. That’s all from Graeme Wearden and me for today. Nadeem Badshah is now taking over. The New Economics Foundation have calculated that the poorest quarter of households will be £210 per week short of an acceptable standard of living by April 2024. NEF warns the measures announced by the Chancellor today fail to protect those who are struggling the most. Since April 2022, they say, the gap to an acceptable standard of living will have grown by £40 per week for the poorest quarter of households. This is based on the minimum income standard (MIS), a measure of what people consider to be an acceptable standard of living. Jeremy Hunt did not announce the removal of VAT on period pants in his speech. But it’s in the autumn statement. “The government will extend the scope of the current VAT zero rate relief on women’s sanitary products to include reusable period underwear from 1 January 2024,” the Treasury says. Here are some of the key charts from today’s autumn statement: Today’s autumn statement was the Conservative government’s first major attempt to claw back a 20% deficit with Labour in the polls, say analysts at Investec, the financial services firm, as “a probable General Election looms in October next year”. But they warn that Hunt may have little extra firepower left for the next budget in March. In a note titled Autumn Statement reaction - The Hunt for a blue October, they say: In a somewhat different version of Groundhog Day, Mr Hunt will have to go through this all again in the spring when he presents his main Budget. How much pressure he comes under to cut taxes again is of course unknown, but it is difficult to envisage him with much more firepower. Overall the Chancellor and the Conservative benches were looking ebullient in parliament today. Time will tell if today’s Autumn Statement and any other policy measures help regain the initiative ahead of the next election. Rishi Sunak and Mel Stride offered Jeremy Hunt congratulations as he sat down. The City of London has reacted much more calmly to today’s autumn statement than it did after Kwasi Kwarteng’s mini-budget of September 2022. Bond prices have fallen a little today, after traders learned that Jeremy Hunt was spending most of the fiscal windfall he received from lower borrowing this year. The Debt Management Office said today it planned to sell £237.3bn of gilts (UK debt) this year, higher than the £222.8bn expected by traders. That has pushed up bond yields (the interest rate on the debt), as investors anticipated more gilts hitting the market than expected. The pound has dropped by around half a cent against the US dollar to $1.2483, and has also slipped against the euro. The rich will benefit most from the cuts to national insurance announced today, the IPPR thinktank says. That also mean people in London and the south-east of England will gain most. The left-leaning thinktank has issued a briefing illustrating this with three charts. This one shows which households gain the most. It says the richest 20% will get almost half of the money available. Or, as it puts it, “for every £100 Hunt spent on personal tax cuts, £46 will benefit the richest fifth of households. Only £3 of every £100 of tax cuts will go to the worst-off families.” This one shows how much workers on different salaries will gain, both in cash terms per week and as a proportion of their post-tax income. The best paid people gain most in cash terms, and people in the top half for earnings, but not at the very top, gain most proportionally. And this chart shows how gains are spread geographically. It says: London and the south-east of England are the biggest winners with an average annual gain per working age person of £316 and £290 respectively. Those in the north-east, Yorkshire and the Humber, and Wales see the smallest benefit, with average gains of £192, £214, and £211 respectively. Commenting on the findings, Henry Parkes, principal economist and head of quantitative research at IPPR, said: There are many reasons why now is not the time for tax cuts; but even less so when the principal beneficiaries of today’s changes will be the best off households, rather than those worst hit by the continuing cost-of-living crisis. They also disproportionately benefit the richest areas of the country most – the opposite of levelling up. More broadly these tax cuts are accompanied by plans to make deep cuts in public services and investment in the future - an approach that commands very little support from the public and will make it harder, not easier, for the UK economy to grow as it needs to. More than 30 Conservative MPs have backed a campaign led by Sir Jake Berry, a former party chair, which involves them signing a pledge not to vote for new taxes that increase the overall tax burden. Jeremy Hunt has now written to Berry assuring him that there is nothing in the autumn statement that goes against this. He says the OBR has confirmed that the measures in it will lower the tax burden. The Sun’s Harry Cole has posted the letter on X. Hunt letter to Jake Berry over “tax pledge” signed by 20+ MPs threatening to vote against new taxes: “I can confirm that AS contains no new taxes that raise tax burden and indeed the OBR has confirmed that the package of measures will lower tax burden by 0.7 ppt in 28-29.” By “lower the tax burden”, Hunt means stop it going up even by ever more than it is already going up. (See 1.45pm.) In his letter, Hunt also thanks Berry for his campaigning “on this important issue”. Normally a chancellor would not be happy about backbench MPs giving pledges to voters that could in theory lead to them refusing to support a government budget. But Hunt and Rishi Sunak are not strong enough to pick a fight with the many Tories backing the campaign. They also want the overall tax burden to fall (although they have not themselves committed the government to never again putting taxes up). UPDATE: Cole subsequently posted this on X about Berry’s reaction. Berry to the 36 tax pledge MPs on Whatsapp: “note that the tax burden will (sadly) rise, however, that was voted on in the last budget. The value of the pledge is it says ‘never again! ... I think we can all afford a gentle pat on our own back for having stopped the rot! Jake” The rabbit out of the hat in the last budget was the surprise announcement of a £4bn funding boost to fund subsidised childcare for parents struggling to pay some of the highest costs in the OECD. But today, early years providers said today’s budget “prioritised pints over childcare” – referencing the fact that pubs and other smaller hospitality, leisure and retail businesses were given a tax break, but not 60,000 early years providers – and undermined the stability of the sector. Sarah Ronan, director of the Early Education and Childcare Coalition, said the uplift in the minimum wage was welcome for low-paid staff in the sector but would endanger providers unless the hourly rate they are paid by the government to provide “free” childcare hours to parents were significantly increased. Ronan said: “Failing to do that is placing providers in a perilous financial position and is likely to lead to more closures at a time when the government should be shoring up the sector,” Joeli Brearley, CEO of the campaign group Pregnant Then Screwed, said: “The irony of an autumn statement on Equal Pay Day which prioritises pints over childcare was not lost on us. The government clearly thinks the crumbs they offered parents during the Spring Statement is enough - it is not. Unfortunately, we won’t see the impact until April when parents struggle to access the childcare funding they were promised, because there are no places available.“ The autumn statement assumes that, at the end of the forecast period (2028-29), the Treasury will have “headroom” (spare cash) worth £13bn, or 0.4% of GDP. Jeremy Hunt boasted about this in his speech, saying: We therefore meet our fiscal rule to have underlying debt falling as a percentage of GDP in the final year of the forecast, with double the headroom compared to the OBR’s March forecast. But the OBR in its report says that almost half of this “headroom” is explained by a forecast rise in fuel duty that will probably never happen. It also suggests that £13bn is not much to boast about anyway and that, without the proposed spending cuts deemed unrealistic (see 3.02pm), Hunt would not have any headroom at all. It says: Headroom of £13bn is considerably lower than the average of £29.7bn that chancellors have held against their fiscal rules since 2010. Our forecast again incorporates £6.2bn of extra revenue in 2028-29 from the government’s stated policy of increasing fuel duty rates in line with RPI inflation and the reversal of the ‘temporary’ 5p cut. If, like all chancellors since 2011, rates are instead held at the current rate then more than 43% of the headroom in 2028-29 would be removed and debt would no longer be falling in 2027-28. The current headroom is also less than it would have cost to maintain the real value of departmental spending at the same level as in our March forecast. The alcohol and pubs industries have toasted measures in the autumn statement aimed at providing some relief to the struggling sector. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, froze alcohol duty and extended 75% business rates relief for hospitality and leisure firms, prolonging a measure initially introduced to help an industry that was hit harder than most by social distancing and lockdowns during the pandemic. The tax break was due to end on 1 August, fuelling fears of a sudden increase in costs that would have been nearly £13,000 a year for the average pub against a backdrop of rising closure rates. Relief will now last for another year. Hunt also froze the small business rates multiplier, the methodology used to calculate bills for the tax. The British Beer &amp; Pubs Association said the measures would save the sector £350m a year, while the Wine &amp; Spirits Trade Association called the duty freeze in particular a “huge relief”. Nick Mackenzie, chief executive of pubs and brewing company Greene King, said the measures would “help provide vital respite’ to pubs struggling with high costs in other areas. However, he and others in the pub industry highlighted concerns about rising staff costs and the ongoing pain caused by inflation. Jeremy Hunt has handed “implausible plans to cut public spending” (see earlier post) to the winner of the next election, says the Resolution Foundation. In their rapid analysis of the autumn statement, Resolution say that pre-election giveaways have arrived early with the biggest tax cuts since 1988 (if you ignore Liz Truss’s proposals, which were largely abandoned). But even so, tax as a share of GDP is still set to rise by 4.5 percentage points (or £4,300 per household) between 2019-20 and 2028-29, they calculate. Torsten Bell, chief executive at the Resolution Foundation, said: “Today the chancellor used an inflation-driven surge in tax receipts to go early on pre-election giveaways – announcing the biggest package of tax cuts since 1988. In doing so, the chancellor has rightly prioritised workers’ earnings and firms’ investment plans. Raising the local housing allowance will also help 1.6 million households struggling with surging rents. “But the truth is taxes are up not down. Today’s cuts are dwarfed by tax rises already under way. By the end of this decade taxes are set to be up by the equivalent of £4,300 per household compared to 2019. “Worse, the giveaways announced today are funded by handing whoever wins the next election implausibly large spending cuts. Tax cuts to boost business investment are welcome, but undermined by plans to cut public investment by over a third – it’s hard to think of a more anti-growth policy.” The OBR has radically reduced its expectations for the take-up of electric vehicles in the UK over the next seven years, and warned that the government’s decision to delay the ban on new petrol and diesel car sales from 2030 to 2035 may dissuade car buyers to go electric. The OBR also points to the increased cost of financing purchases and the smaller difference in EV running costs compared with fossil fuel cars. Its latest forecast says just 38% of new vehicles sold in the UK in 2027 will be electric, down from the 67% it forecast in March. Growth in EV sales has already slowed, partly due to higher electricity prices and lower pump prices for petrol cars, as well as higher interest rates. The OBR now expects uptake to track the ZEV mandate, which forces manufacturers to sell a certain proportion of zero-emission vehicles, rising to 80% in 2030. The prolonged used of dirtier cars will bring in slightly more fuel duty to the government – an average £700m extra a year on the new forecast. Hunt today pledged £520m for “transformational manufacturing investments” in the life sciences sector from 2025-26. Two research &amp; development tax relief schemes will be merged next April to simplify the system, and within this the rate at which lossmaking companies get taxed will be reduced from 25% to 19% . This was welcomed by businesses, although subcontractors hiring R&amp;D staff could lose out. James Sheppard, UK &amp; Ireland managing director at the lab and office provider Kadans Science Partner, said: “We welcome the announcement from the chancellor that the government plans to progress its proposed Mansion House Reforms to pension funds announced earlier this year hoping to unlock £25bn for innovative companies in the UK by 2030. The historic lack of investment in life sciences infrastructure in the UK has meant that the industry hasn’t been sufficiently supported to reach its growth potential. These new measures, including further tax reform for loss making SMEs, are a welcome step-change if the UK is to reach its goal of becoming a life sciences superpower. Paul Johnson, the director of the IFS, has just issued his early analysis of the autumn statement. Johnson starts by “getting a few things straight”: The public finances haven’t meaningfully improved. The growth outlook has weakened. Inflation is expected to stay higher for longer. Higher inflation pushes up tax receipts by more than it pushes up spending on debt interest or social security benefits; but rather than use the proceeds to ease the ongoing ‘fiscal drag’ effects of threshold freezes, or to compensate public services for higher costs, the chancellor opted to cut other taxes. His immediate cut to national insurance will put more money into workers’ pockets when it comes in but won’t be enough to prevent this from being the biggest tax-raising parliament in modern times. Johnson then warns that announcing immediate and certain tax cuts in response to highly uncertain changes in assumptions about the UK’s medium-term economic prospects is “does not feel like a recipe for good management of the public finances”. He says: His [the chancellor’s] so called “headroom” against a rather loose fiscal target is minuscule and the OBR could easily take it away in the Spring Budget with some very small changes to forecasts. What will he do then? Certainly, whoever is Chancellor after the next general election is going to have very little room for manoeuvre. Having said all that, Johnson concludes, Hunt has chosen a “pretty sensible set of taxes to cut”. Making full expensing permanent rather than temporary is welcome. Cutting rates of national insurance is preferable to cutting rates of income tax and may help boost employment. But these tax cuts have been ‘paid for’, in effect, by letting fiscal drag become even more of a tax rise than previously expected and through a bigger squeeze on the real-terms value of public service budgets and an even bigger squeeze on public investment, which is frozen in cash terms. There’s a material risk that those plans prove undeliverable and today’s tax cuts will not prove to be sustainable.” The Labour MP Alex Cunningham has claimed that his constituency was described as a “shithole” by the home secretary, James Cleverly, during prime minister’s questions. Ben Quinn has the story. The Liberal Democrats have described the autumn statement as a “Hunt hoax”. In a statement, Ed Davey said the government was implementing a £200bn stealth tax raid and he said the amount people would gain from the national insurance cut announced today would not compensate for the extra tax they were paying because of allowances and thresholds being frozen. Davey said: This autumn statement was a Hunt hoax. Buried in the small print is a massive stealth tax raid that will drag millions into paying a higher rate in the coming years. The British people will rightly be furious at this deception, as they are forced to pay the price for Conservative chaos through years of unfair tax hikes. It is high time that this Conservative government came clean about just how much money they are taking out of hard-working families’ pockets. The Lib Dems says that, even after the national insurance cut announced today, someone earning £35,000 a year will still be paying an extra £400 in tax in 2024-25. And a higher rate taxpayer will still be paying an extra £1,200 a year, the Lib Dems says. To justify calling it a £200bn stealth tax, the Lib Dems aren’t looking at the extra revenue raised annually (the standard methodology), but are instead adding together all the annual figures for stealth tax revenue in the chart published by the OBR. See 2.30pm. Living standards are still heading for the worst fall in at least seven decades, despite the cut to national insurance rates announced today, the Office for Budget Responsibility says. Living standards, as measured by real household disposable income (RHDI) per person, are forecast to be 3.5% lower in 2024-25 than their pre-pandemic level. While this is half the peak-to-trough fall the fiscal watchdog expected in March, it still represents the largest reduction in real living standards since ONS records began in the 1950s. The OBR explains: RHDI per person recovers its pre-pandemic level in 2027-28, something not achieved in our March forecast, as resilient labour incomes begin to steadily outmatch slowing inflation. We estimate that the reduction in the rate of NICs announced in the autumn statement will boost real household incomes by around 0.5% at the end of the forecast. Resolution Foundation’s Torsten Bell says Conservative MPs should be worried…. Q: How responsible was it of Jeremy Hunt to spend the windfall from higher inflation [which has lifted tax revenues]? OBR chief Richard Hughes points out that the chancellor’s headroom to avoid breaching his fiscal rule [to have public sector net debt falling at the end of the forecast horizon] has risen to £13bn, from £6.5bn in March. But, that’s partly because the target has now moved forward a year, to 2028-29. Overall, Hughes says, the health of the public finances are broadly unchanged compared with March. Q: With the UK’s national debt nearly 100% of GDP, could it cope with another crisis such as the Covid-19 pandemic? OBR chief Richard Hughes tells today’s press conference that it all depends how interest rates reacted to a crisis – that would determine the government’s room for manoeuvre. Hughes explains that when shocks hit everybody, rates on government borrowing tend to fall, which gives ministers some space to fund stimulus measures. A worry would be a crisis that pushed up interest rates – such as one which resulted in higher energy costs, as that is inflationary. The autumn statement amounts to be biggest “giveaway” package in a budget or autumn statement since 2010, excluding the Covid-related one, the OBR says. This chart from the OBR report illustrates this point. “Fiscal loosening” means, overall, the measure involves the Treasury “giving money away”, by cutting taxes or raising spending. “Fiscal tightening” is the opposite. The March 2020 budget came before the Covid lockdown, but it included Covid-related stimulus measures worth £30bn. The impact of the national insurance tax break will unfairly benefit men rather than women, Dr Mary-Ann Stephenson, director of the Women’s Budget Group (WBG) has warned. The WBG has calculated that single mothers will gain an extra £76 a year from the changes to NICs compared to £248 a year for lone fathers and £437 a year for households with two parents. They argue that with the number of single parent households living destitution tripling since 2019, single parents are the most likely to be hit by the benefit cap and in need of local services like childcare and health services. “We are heading into a winter that will be even tougher than last year,” said Stephenson, who added: Cost of living payments are ending, but prices – in particular food, energy and housing costs – remain very high. Women are the shock absorbers of poverty and continue to bear the brunt of the cost of living crisis. Q: Is the chancellor getting as big a ‘bang for his buck’ as he’d like from his measures, asks our colleague Phillip Inman at the OBR’s press conference. Professor David Miles, a member of the OBR’s budget responsibility committee, replies that increasing the underlying supply potential of the economy is very hard. You need to push very hard, just to move it a little bit. Miles says the changes to capital allowances, and the national insurance rate cuts, add “a fraction of 1%”. You could look at that and think it’s not a lot, Miles says, but it’s partly because the full impact of making full expensing permanent falls beyond the OBR’s forecast horizon. Miles warns: It’s actually very difficult for governments to – in a relatively short period like a few years – make a meaningful impact on growth. Jeremy Hunt’s controversial decision not to announce any major departmental spending increases to reflect higher inflation has given him the firepower for today’s tax cuts, the Office for Budget Responsibility shows. The head of the OBR, Richard Hughes, has explained to reporters that Departmental Expenditure Limits (DELs) make up 40% of public spending. They are set periodically, and the next review is not until after the general election. This means that for the years beyond 2024-25, the Treasury has simply told the OBR that departmental spending will rise by £5bn per year. That, Hughes explains, means that departmental real spending power has been eroded by £19bn compared with the March forecast. Speaking at a press conference now, Hughes says: The eagle-eyed amongst you will recognise that is roughly equal to the amount the chancellor spent on the two big tax cuts in this fiscal event. Had he sought to preserve the real spending power of public services, in the face of higher inflation over the next five years, that would have left him with relatively little to spend on other measures. As we flagged in the previous post, economists say the Treasury’s spending assumption is simply unrealistic. Hughes says that the pressures on departmental spending are rising, due to rising inflation and policy changes such as the NHS workforce plan, or the aim to raise defence spending as a share of GDP. The OBR says that Jeremy Hunt’s plans for the future assume that, in real terms, annual govenrment spending by 2027-28 will be £19.1bn lower than it was assumed at the time of the March budget. Economists say this is not realistic. The Treasury has not said exactly how much each department will be getting that far ahead. But the OBR says that, given some departmental spending is in effect protected, in unprotected departments day-to-day spending will fall by 2.3% in real terms in 2025-26. If defence spending goes up to 2.5% of GDP, as the government has promised, and if aid spending returns to 0.7% of national income, unprotected spending would have to fall by 4.1%, the OBR says. This chart from the OBR report illustrates these numbers. The OBR says, diplomatically, that this would “present challenges”. It says: Delivering a 2.3% a year real terms fall in day-to-day spending would present challenges. Performance indicators for public services continue to show signs of strain, for example the backlog in crown courts reached a record high of 65,000 in August 2023 and eleven ‘section 114s’ notices have been issued by local authorities since 2018, compared to two in the preceding 18 years. The Institute for Government’s recent report found that performance in eight out of nine major public services has declined since 2010, with schools the exception. Longer-term pressures on public spending, such as from climate change and an ageing population, are also building. Ian Mulheirn, an economist at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, is a lot blunter. He says these spending plans are implausible. OBR draws out completely implausible implications -real terms cuts of 2.3-4.1%\/yr after 2025 for unprotected departments 🤯 What’s the plan here? Abolish the criminal justice system and public transport maybe? This should be the debate, not ‘have they really cut taxes?’ Central story of the #Autumnstatement is that a (nominal) £21bn\/yr tax cut has been funded from (real) £19bn\/yr cut in public services This isn’t sustainable and whoever wins the election will have to raise those taxes again – and then some – just to keep the wheels on This is from Daniel Tomlinson from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation thinktank. The government has cut spending plans by £19bn a year compared to the previous forecast, even as pressures on public spending mount. Not a serious way to run a budget. And this is from Chris Giles from the Financial Times. The key point of the autumn statement from @OBR_UK Public finances better because public spending is not rising with higher inflation These proposed spending figures suggest Hunt doesn’t expect his party to be winning the next election. They also support the argument made by Rafael Behr in his column today about Hunt setting a trap for Labour. The OBR’s verdict on inflation is blunt: it expects inflation to remain higher for longer. It now takes until the second quarter of 2025 for the CPI inflation rate to return to the 2% target, more than a year later than forecast in March. Inflation is also more domestically fuelled, the OBR says. Although gas prices have fallen faster than expected, stronger nominal wage growth means people have more money to spend. From a peak of 10.7% in the last quarter of last year, CPI inflation is now expected to fall to 4.8% in the final quarter of 2023. This higher inflation means that the financial markets expect interest rates to be around 1 percentage point higher than they did in March. The OBR says: Bank rate reached a 15-year high of 5.25% in August 2023, around 100 basis points above our previous forecast. And markets now expect bank rate to settle at 4% by the end of the forecast, rather than fall to 3% as we assumed in March. The OBR report contains fresh figures on the impact of “fiscal drag”. It is well known that the government’s decision to freeze tax allowances and thresholds for six years means that large numbers of people are being brought into higher tax brackets, or into paying tax in the first place, but the latest figures are still quite striking. The OBR says: Between 2022-23 and 2028-29, this set of threshold freezes means nearly 4 million additional individuals will be expected to pay income tax, 3 million more will have moved to the higher rate, and 400,000 more onto the additional rate. This represents an increase in the number of taxpayers in each band of income tax – 11% for the basic rate band, 68% for the higher rate and 49% for the additional rate. Relative to our March forecast, this is a respective increase in 2027-28 of 830,000, 900,000, and 43,000. The OBR also says that, by 2028-29, these policies will have raised an extra £44.6bn for the Treasury. Retailers and hospitality businesses were disappointed by the chancellor’s plans to increase business rates for larger businesses, which will add almost £1.7bn to bills next year according to analysts. There was relief that the rates discount of 75% for smaller hospitality, leisure and retail businesses operating in premises with a rateable value of less than £51,000 is to be extended by one year, benefiting about 1m businesses. A further 740,000 will continue to benefit from 100% small business rates relief. However, around 220,000 ratepayers will see their bills rise in line with September’s CPI figure of 6.7%, according to analysts at Gerald Eve, costing them £1.66bn next year and £8bn over the next five years. The British Retail Consortium trade body described the business rates decision as a “disappointing announcement”. Kate Nicholls, the head of UK Hospitality, which represents thousands of pubs, restaurants and cafes, said many small businesses operated from larger standard rated premises and so would not benefit from the relief. Simon Green, head of business rates at Gerald Eve, said: “The Chancellor’s business rates measures are ‘smoke and mirrors’. They are designed to win him plaudits for protecting businesses from rates increases whilst still raking in an extra £8bn in rates revenue. “Around 89% of all properties will indeed benefit from the freeze announced, but it is larger businesses – paying rates for some 220,000 properties – which pay over 75% of all rates next year, upon which this stealth tax will fall.” Britain’s biggest green energy investors have enjoyed a share price bounce after the chancellor’s autumn statement, which has promised to accelerate £90bn in business investment over the next 10 years by making it easier to move ahead with multibillion-pound projects. Shares in SSE, National Grid and the Copenhagen-listed Ørsted climbed as Jeremy Hunt set out plans to speed up planning consents, cut the wait for new grid connections and offer some of the most generous tax breaks of any developed economy for investors. The companies, which are planning to make multibillion-pound investments in the UK’s green energy transition, are expected to benefit from the Treasury’s promise to make “full expensing” permanent in what Hunt described as “the largest business tax cut in modern British history”. Shares in National Grid and SSE, which plans to invest £40bn in clean energy over the next 10 years, climbed to four-month highs after Hunt set out his plans. SSE’s share price climbed by almost 1% to 1,806p a share while National Grid’s share price climbed by nearly 0.5% to 1,043p a share. For Denmark’s Ørsted the tax breaks could tip the balance in its decision on whether to move ahead with its £8bn plan to build the world’s biggest offshore windfarm off the Yorkshire coast. Its plan to develop the Hornsea 3 project was plunged into doubt due to a recent surge in offshore wind supply chain costs which led the company to cancel two major offshore wind projects off the US coast. Ørsted is expected to make a final decision on the project before the end of the year. Unemployment is expected to rise by more than forecast at the March budget. The Office for Budget Responsibility’s central forecast is that unemployment rises to 1.6 million people (4.6% of the labour force) and peaks in the second quarter of 2025. That peak is 85,000 higher than expected in March – when it was expected to be 4.4% –and comes a year later than expected. The OBR predicts that demand for labour will weaken, due to slower growth and the rise in interest rates. Unemployment then falls back to its assumed structural rate of 4.1% by the forecast horizon, as the bank rate falls and the spare capacity in the economy is taken up, the OBR adds. You can read all the Treasury autumn statement documents on its website here. Here is the main autumn statement green book. The key table, the scorecard showing how much all the measures will raise or cost the Treasury in the years going ahead, starts on page 81. And here is the Office for Budget Responsibility’s assessment – its economic and fiscal outlook report. Disappointing economic news: the OBR has revised down its estimate of the medium-term potential growth rate of the economy to 1.6%, from 1.8% at the March budget. The revision is largely driven by a weaker forecast for the average hours an employee will work, which is now forecast to fall rather than remain static. The OBR says: This largely reflects our reassessment of the effect of demographic shifts in the composition of the working population toward younger and older age groups who work shorter hours on average. The TUC say it’s a ‘damning judgement’ on the autumn statement: UK house prices are forecast to fall by 4.7% next year, the Office for Budget Responsibility’s new economic and fiscal outlook shows. That follows an estimated 0.9% rise this year, with the OBR lifting its forecast for mortgage rates over the next few years. The OBR says: This would be consistent with the price of the average UK home reaching a low of around £266,000 at its trough in the final quarter of 2024. All in all, from their high in the fourth quarter of 2022 to their low in the final quarter of 2024, nominal house prices are expected to decline by 7.6%. As this chart shows, that’s a smaller fall than forecast in March. The OBR then expects a slow recovery in house prices, but it will take until the second half of 2027 for them to reach their 2022 peak, they estimate. Reeves says things might look fine to Sunak 10,000ft up in his helicopter. But on the ground people know the reality is different, she says. She says 1.6 million families will have to remortage this year. People are having to pay on average more than £200 a month, she says. And in Hunt’s constituency the average increase will be £420 a month, she says. Working people do not have that sort of money hanging around, she says. Tory economic recklessness is not a thing of the past, she says. People are still paying the price. She says the Tories voted against an amendment to the king’s speech last week which would have prevented a repeat of the mini-budget horror show (by banning fiscal announcements like that without an OBR assessment). They have not learned their lessons, she says. At the election, the question will be simple. Do people feel better off? Do services work better? Does anything work better? Working people are worse off under the Tories. Taxes are up, debt is up – and their time is up too, she says. Sir Nicholas Macpherson, the former top civil servant at the Treasury, has posted that chancellor Hunt is funding his national insurance cut by raising more money through income tax – in a reversal of decades of fiscal policy. For all the talk of tax cutting from Jeremy Hunt, the UK’s tax burden is still forecast to increase to a postwar high! The Office for Budget Responsibility says that the tax changes in this autumn statement reduce the tax burden by 0.7% of GDP. However, that burden rises in every year to a postwar high of 37.7% of GDP by 2028-29. The OBR says that income tax increases explain most of the increase in this forecast, rising from 10.2% of GDP this year, to 11.3% in 2028-29. That is driven by the freezing of income tax thresholds – which means fiscal drag will put more people into higher bands as their nominal wages increase. The OBR says: By 2028-29, frozen thresholds result in nearly 4 million additional workers paying income tax, 3 million more moved to the higher rate, and 400,000 more paying the additional rate. VAT and corporation tax also rise from 6.4% and 3.4% of GDP this year to 6.5% and 3.6% of GDP in 2028-29. The OBR says this is because “consumption shifts back towards standard VAT-rated goods and companies face the full-year effects of the rise in the main corporation tax rate”. Reeves welcomes the extra money for tackling antisemitism. She says Hunt calls this an autumn statement for growth. But Labour has led the way on this, she says. She says Hunt’s plan is just a “cover version” of hers. She says Labour would go further on pension fund reform. And she says Hunt is copying plans already announced by Labour on planning reform. She also says Labour said full expensing should be made permanent. Reeves says some NHS trusts are still using fax machines. The Tories have failed to invest in the health service, she says. Reeves says, to grow the economy, more people need to be in work. She says Labour believes that, if people can work, they should work. It has called for reform of the work capability assessment, she says. Too many people are out of work because of long-term health isssues, she says. As Jeremy Hunt sits down, the Office for Budget Responsibility releases its assessment of the autumn statement. And the topline is that chancellor Hunt has received a windfall of £27bn – and spent almost all of it. That windfall comes because borrowing so far this financial year has been lower than expected, partly because high inflation has lifted tax receipts. But departmental spending budgets are not inflation-linked, so did not automatically rise in response. The OBR says: The economy has proved more resilient to the shocks of the pandemic and energy crisis than we anticipated. But inflation has also been more persistent and interest rates higher than in March. Higher inflation boosts tax revenues but also welfare benefits while higher interest rates push up debt servicing. But because departmental spending is left largely unchanged, this delivers a net fiscal windfall of £27 billion. The Chancellor spends virtually all of this on a 2p cut in NICs, permanent tax relief for business investment, and further welfare reforms, leaving debt falling by a narrow margin in five years. Reeves says 177 economies are expected to grow more quickly than the UK over the next few years. And next year the UK is forecast to have the slowest growth in the G7. The UK is more world-following than world-beating. Under Labour, the economy grew by 2% on average every year, she says. Under the Tories growth has been 1.5%, she says. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, is speaking now. She says the government’s plans are not working and people are “still worse off”. She says she can remember when Rishi Sunak was arguing for an increase in national insurance. Labour opposed that plan then. Now Sunak is implementing a cut – which means he is arguing with himself, she says. She says the public knows that today’s announcements are about a party wanting to hold on to power. Ahead of today, the government had implemented tax increases equivalent to a 10% increase in national insurance. So today’s 2% cut will “not remotely” compensate for those, she says. Hunt says his decision to lower the main national insurance rate from 12% to 10% will save a worker on the average salary of £35,000 over £450 per year. The average nurse will save £520, the chancellor says, while a typical police officer would save £630. Hunt turns to tax cuts. He says he promised to only cut taxes when that was affordable, and possible without putting up inflation. Today the OBR says that is possible, he says. High taxes disencourage work, he adds, and taking into account national insurance, people pay a 32% marginal tax rate. National insurance will be cut, he announces. He is going to cut the main rate for employee national insurance from 12% to 10%. He says 27 million people will benefit. He says that is worth £450 for someone on average earnings. Hunt says normally this could come in at the start of the tax year, in April. But instead he will introduce emergency legislation to bring this in from 6 January. He says the OBR says this will lead to the workforce going up by 94,000. The Treasury says: From January employee national insurance contributions will drop from 12% to 10%. That’s a £450 tax cut for the average worker earning £35,400. Helping people keep more of the money they earn &amp; making work pay. Part of our plan to grow the economy. Hunt confirms the increases to the national living wage announced yesterday. Hunt claims Labour wanted to address poverty by tinkering with tax credits. But his party believes in getting people into work, he says. Hunt says the government needs to back workers as well as businesses. He says he wants to increase incentives to work. He praises Mel Stride, the work and pensions secretary. He says Stride’s reforms build on universal credit. Those measures were opposed by Labour, he says. He says 30 hours of free childcare for one- and two-year-olds was announced in the spring budget. Today he is announcing measure for the long-term unemployed, and people who do not work due to sickness or disability. Under the back-to-work plan, the sick note system will be changed, to assume that people can work. The work capability assessment will be changed. And more support will be offered of people going into work. The government will ask for something in return, he says. If after 18 months of help, there will be mandatory work experience. And if people do not participate, the government will close the case and stop their benefits. He says the OBR thinks this will get another 200,000 people into the workforce. Labour wants to expand the workforce by immigration, he claims. He says his party wants to use workers from Britain. Hunt says these measure will increase business investment by £20bn a year – almost 1% of GDP. Hunt is now on full expensing. (See 10.36am.) This will cost £11bn a year, he says. But today it is affordable. Full expensing will be made permanent. It is “the largest business tax cut in modern British history”. The Treasury says: NEWS: Due to the success of full expensing we are making it permanent. This means that companies that invest in the UK will reduce their tax by up to 25p for every £1 they spend on plant and machinery. Shares in NatWest have dropped, after Hunt said he would explore options to sell some of the government’s stake in the bank through a “retail share offer”. The government is currently the largest shareholder in NatWest, holding 39.39% of its shares. That stake dates back to the bailout of Royal Bank of Scotland (which rebranded as NatWest) after the 2008 financial crisis. NatWest’s shares are down 1% at 205p, as City traders anticipate some of the government’s stake hitting the market. Hunt joked that it was “time to get Sid investing again”, a reference to the 1980s campaign to persuade the public to take part in the privatisation of British Gas, as the Thatcher government flogged off much of the UK’s “family silver”. Hunt says he is abolishing class 2 national insurance, which is paid by the self-employed. This will save them £192 per year. Nearly 2 million self-employed people will benefit, he says. And he says the self-employed also pay class 4 national insurance at 9%. That will go down to 8%. Taken together, these measures will save self-employed workers £350. Hunt turns to small businesses. He says he ran one once. Every big business started as a small one, he says. He says SMEs want bills paid on time. The government will ensure firms bidding for government contracts have to pay their bills on time – with 55 days at first, and then within 30 days. He says the 75% business rates discount for hospitality, retail and leisure is being extended for another year, at a cost of £4.3bn. Hunt says £1bn of extra levelling up money was announced on Monday. And there is £80m for projects in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, he says. Hunt says he announced plans for 12 investment zones – mini Canary Wharfs – in the spring. He says tax reliefs for freeports and investment zones are being extended from five years to 10 years. And he says he is announcing three more investment zones today in the West Midlands, the east Midlands and Greater Manchester. These should bring in private investment of £3bn, and 65,000 jobs. And there will be a new investment zone in Wrexham and Flintshire, he says. The new GDP forecasts show that UK growth is stronger than expected this year, but weaker than previously expected in 2024, 2025 and 2026. Here are the new forecasts, compared to the OBR’s forecasts at the March budget: 2023: growth of 0.6%, up from a GDP fall of 0.2% forecast in March 2024: growth of 0.7%, down from 1.8% growth forecast in March 2025: growth of 1.4%, down from 2.5% growth forecast in March 2026: growth of 1.9%: down from 2.1% growth forecast in March 2027: growth of 2%, up from 1.9% growth forecast in March 2028: growth of 1.7% Although downgraded, these forecasts are still more optimistic than the Bank of England, though; it fears there is a 50-50 chance of a recession by the middle of next year. Hunt says he is publishing plans to make available £4.5bn over five years to attract investment into strategic manufacturing sectors. This will include money for electric cars and life sciences. He says these investments will ensure the UK remains competitive in sectors where it already leads, and innovative in areas where it does not. Hunt says the Barbie movie was filmed in Watford. He says he wants to ensure more films are made in the UK. The Treasury says on X. Our creative sector is worth £126bn a year to the economy. To boost global competitiveness, we will work with the industry to provide additional tax relief for visual effects expenditure - helping to attract more investment into the UK. He announces changes to R&amp;D tax relief. Hunt says, based on the success of supercomputing centres in Edinburgh and Bristol, he will invest in more of these to make the UK an AI powerhouse. Hunt says he will explore the options for selling off the government’s remaining shares in NatWest. Hunt announces changes to the rules for pension funds. And he says he will give workers the right to require new employers to pay pension money into an existing pension pot. Hunt says the government is accepting all the recommendations in Lord Harrington’s report into foreign direct investment Hunt says it takes too long to improve infrastructure projects. From next year, councils will be able to recover the full costs of planning applications – provided they meet prompt deadlines. He says Starmer said he wanted to be a builder, not a blocker. But Labour blocked reform of nutrient neutrality (river pollution) rules, which, Hunt claims, will stop 100,000 extra homes being built. He says plans are being announced to bust the planning backlog. And the government will consult on a law to allow any house to be converted into two flats, provided the exterior is respected. Here are the new estimates for the UK’s budget deficit, which Hunt rattled off briskly. As you can see, borrowing is lower for most years than expected back at the March budget, and is hitting the second fiscal rule (that debt is below 3% of the economy) most years. 2023-24: 4.5% of GDP, lower than the 5.1% of GDP ( £131.6bn) forecast in March 2024-25: 3% of GDP, lower than the 3.2% of GDP (£85.4bn) forecast in March 2025-26: 2.7% of GDP, lower than the 2.8% of GDP (£76.7bn) forecast in March 2026-27: 2.3% of GDP, higher than the 2.2% of GDP (£63.5bn) forecast in March 2027-28: 1.6% of GDP, lower than the 1.7% of GDP (£49.3bn) forecast in March 2027-28: 1.1% of GDP Hunt turns to skills. The government has reformed schools, he says. But 9 million adults still have low literacy or numeracy skills. That is why the government has announced plans to reform A-levels, he says, introducing the Advanced British Standard. Hunt says the UK has grown faster than many European economies since 2010. Last year the OBR forecast a recession this year. But the economy has grown instead, he says. It is 1.8% larger than it was pre-pandemic. He reads out the growth forecasts. To make those numbers higher, higher productivity is needed, he says. He claims the 110 measures being announced today will boost business investment by £20bn a year. Hunt says he expects to raise an extra £5bn over the forecast period by making sure everyone pays the tax they owe. Hunt says he wants a more productive state. He wants public sector productivity to rise by at least 0.5% per year. Over time the growth in public spending will be lower than the growth in the economy, he says. Hunt announces new money for veterans. This is from the Treasury’s tweet. Members of the armed forces put their lives on the line to safeguard British freedoms every day. This is why we’re confirming an additional £10m to support veterans – helping to fund vital mental health services for veterans in their communities across the United Kingdom. Hunt rattles through the debt figures. He says debt will be falling, not just at the end of the forecast period, as the target says, but in most years too. Hunt turns to borrowing, and says Labour will increase it by £28bn a year. But borrowing is just a deferred tax on future generations, as Nigel Lawson says, he says. He says Keir Starmer disagrees. He and Starmer have something in common, he says. They both wanted to make a Jeremy prime minister, he says. Hunt says debt has been due to rise to almost 100% of GDP. But now it is predicted to be 94% of GDP by the end of the forecast. He reads out the precise figures. The UK will continue to have the second lowest debt in the G7, he says. Hunt says that inflation is forecast to drop to 2.8% by the end of 2024, down from 4.6% recorded in October. And it will drop to 2% (the Bank of England’s inflation target) in 2025, Hunt says. But back in March, the Office for Budget Responsibility had estimated that inflation would fall to just 0.9% in 2024. So this suggests inflation is more persistent than the OBR had expected back in the spring. Hunt says the triple lock has been a lifeline for pensioners. There have been reports that it might be uprated by a lower amount, ignoring the impact of bonuses on wage figures. But from April next year the state pension will go up by 8.5% – which will be worth up to £900 a year, he says. Hunt confirms he has frozen all alcohol duty until 1 August next year. Hunt says he is increasing the housing allowance. This will give 1.6 million people an extra £800 next year, he says. Hunt says benefits will be increased by 6.7%, in line with September’s inflation figure. He says he chose not to use the lower October figure, as some people speculated he might. Hunt is now on the OBR forecasts. He says the government is delivering on halving inflation, growing the economy and reducing debt. He says the shadow chancellor did not mention inflation in her conference speech. His came first. So all she had to do was a bit of copy and pasting, he jokes. Hunt expresses his horror at the murderous attack on Israelis on 7 October, and the subsequent loss of life on both sides. He says he is giving up to £7m over the next three years to organisations like the Community Security Trust to tackle antisemitism. Hunt says there are 110 growth measures in the autumn statement. He will not go through them all, he says. He says the OBR says these measure will raise investment, increase employment and raise GDP. Jeremy Hunt is making his statement now. He starts by saying he comes with good news – it is his wife’s birthday, and she is looking younger every year. He is turning to the statement, he says. The government has taken difficult decision to put the economy “back on track”. The economy has grown, and real incomes are working, he says. He says others proposed a more short-term approach. But the government has not given the public sector unaffordable pay rises, it has not banned new oil exploration, and it has not promised £28bn extra annual borrowing. Jeremy Hunt is about to start his autumn statement. This, from ITV’s Robert Peston, illustrates the challenge he faces. Daniel Zeichner (Lab) says people are cringing from Elon Musk’s latest outburst. What did the PM think he would learn from someone who took over a once-successful organisation and put it into a death spiral? Sunak says it is surprising to see an MP for Cambridge disparaging technology. He defends the AI summit he organised. Gareth Thomas (Lab) asks if Sunak was telling the truth when he told the Covid inquiry that he had taken advice from scientists about the eat out to help out scheme – when Sir Patrick Vallance told the inquiry that this was not the case. Sunak says he will be giving evidence himself. But he claims the government did take advice on this from scientific advisers. Andrew Western (Lab) says the government does not have a functioning asylum system. Will the PM disapply human rights laws to implement the Rwanda policy? Sunak says small boat arrivals are down 33% this year. Sunak claims 1.7 million fewer people are living in poverty. (He seems to be referring to absolute poverty, not relative poverty – which makes this a misleading claim.) Kevin Foster (Con) asks what the govenrment is doing about homelessness. Sunak says the government is investing £2bn in this area. Liam Fox, the former Tory international trade secretary, says peace requires freedom from fear and terror. Does the PM agree that only when all the people in the Middle East have these can we talk about peace in the region? Sunak does agree. Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader at Westminster, expresses her condolences to the families of the four young men killed in the accident in Wales. Will the government do something about unfair standing charges on energy bills? Sunak says the government has already offered people help with energy bills. Stephen Flynn, the SNP’s leader at Westminster, asks what will happen after the pause in fighting in Gaza is over. He suggests MPs should back a permanent ceasefire. Sunak says the pause is a crucial first step. The government wants to see hostages released, he says. He thanks Qatar for its interventions. Flynn says it is not a pause in the killing of children that is needed, but an end to their killing. Sunak should push for a permanent ceasefire, he says. And if he won’t, will he recognise the state of Palestine. Sunak say the agreement shows it was not right to push for a unilateral ceasefire. That would have emboldened Hamas, he says. And he says the government supports a process leading to a two-state solution. And it wants the Palestinians to be strengthened. The government will recognise the state of Palestine “when it best serves the interests of peace”. Starmer says Sunak is trying to blame the opposition for his own failures. He quotes the mum he spoke to this morning whose son is waiting for treatment. The suicide rate for 15 to 19-year-olds has doubled since 2010, he says. Politics can turn this around. Scrapping tax loopholes could fund thousands more staff, he says. He says that would give people their lives back, and enable people to go back to work. That’s Labour’s plan. Will Sunak back it? Sunak says his is the first government to publish a long-term NHS workforce plan. He says Labour’s record was a “disastrous failure of workforce planning”. That was what the Labour-chaired health committee said, he says. Starmer says that, on Sunak’s watch, 2.5 million people are now too sick to work, “with the majority also suffering from mental health issues”. Can the PM tell us how many people are now waiting for mental health treatment, Starmer asks. Sunak says “record funds” have been invested in services. But, he adds, NHS strikes have led to thousands of cancelled appointments. In response to Sunak’s next claim that waiting lists have come down in England, Starmer says we are “through the looking glass”. Earlier this week, it was revealed that one in three people have missed work in the last year because of delays in accessing NHS care. The Observer, meanwhile, reported over the weekend that Sunak’s pledge to slash NHS waiting lists has effectively been downgraded amid an increase in the number of patients in England waiting longer than 18 months for treatment. Starmer says Sunak is taking no responsibility for the state of the NHS. Sunak would not accept those waits for his family, and nor should anyone else. He refers to a family waiting for treatment. How do they feel when they see the PM boasting that everything is fine? Sunak says the government is doing all it can to put money into the NHS. People deserve treatment. But it is galling to hear Starmer complain when his party does not condemn NHS strikes. And he won’t back the legislation to guarantee people get treatment. Starmer says 1.2 million people are waiting for mental health treatment, including 200,000 children. Would Sunak accept that for family or friends? Sunak says he will expand patient choice. Labour’s policy on this has been a muddle, he says. Starmer says more than double the entire population of Wales are on a waiting list in England. How many people are waiting for mental health treatment? Sunak says the union action that Labour fails to condemn has led to several hundred thousand cancelled appointments, making waiting lists worse. In England 18-month waits have virtually been eliminated, but not in Wales, he says. Next, Rishi Sunak is pressed on comments yesterday by Laura Trott, chief secretary to the Treasury, who said people with mobility and mental health problems will be asked to work from home or lose benefits as part of “their duty”. Sunak is asked how many job vacancies are currently available for people who can only work from home. The PM replies that he doesn’t want to pre-empt anything that might appear in the chancellor’s upcoming autumn statement. Starmer asks how workers can grow the economy if they have to wait a year for an operation. Sunak says he hopes the Welsh NHS is listening. Keir Starmer welcomes the pause announced in the Middle East. He says he wants both sides to make progress to a full cessation of hostilities. He says in the past the international community has treated the two-state solution as a formality. That must change, he says. He asks if Sunak forget to include the NHS in his latest five pledges. Rishi Sunak says he has put record funding into the NHS, and announced a workforce plan. On the pledges, he says he has halved inflation and he claims he has reduced debt. UPDATE: This is from Bloomberg’s Alex Wickham. Sunak in the House claims his govt has “reduced debt” IFS to @Joe_Mayes earlier this month: “Public sector debt is currently rising in cash terms, real terms, and, most importantly, as a percent of national income. Rishi Sunak begins by offering his condolences to the families of the four teenagers who died in Wales. He also welcomes the announcement of the “humanitarian pause” between Israel and Gaza. The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, in his opening statement, echoes both these sentiments. On the four teenagers, he says he can “hardly imagine” the pain the families are experiencing. Rishi Sunak is taking PMQs. Jeremy Hunt delivers the autumn statement when PMQs ends, soon after 12.30pm. Here are some more lines from what Prof Sir Chris Whitty has been telling the Covid inquiry this morning. Whitty, chief medical officer for England and chief medical adviser for the UK, said that his biggest communications error was to talk about “behavioural fatigue”. This was the theory that people would not be willing to keep complying with Covid restrictions for a long period of time. Before lockdown was announced, Whitty cited this in public as one reason why restrictions should not be imposed too early. Whitty told the inquiry: This is one where my communications were really poor, frankly, and I said in my statement, this is probably my most prominent, at least in my view, communications error. Whitty also said he was “told off” by his behavioural science colleagues for his phrasing and subsequently no longer spoke about the issue publicly. He said “herd immunity” was never a policy goal at any point during the pandemic and the references to this by some officials in public were unhelpful. He said: I don’t think I ever saw anybody on the record, or anybody sensible, aiming for it [herd immunity] as a goal. I think some people tried to explain it as ‘this is what would happen over time’, I think frankly, unhelpfully … If we were to go back in terms of our communication errors along the way – and there were a lot – this is firmly one of the ones where I think we didn’t help the public by having a debate that I think, quite rightly, upset and confused a lot of people. He also said the term meant different things to different people. Some people were meaning the herd immunity threshold – this is the point at which, for practical purposes, further waves are unlikely, which is very high. The modellers were using it in the sense of a gradual increase – gradually increasing levels of immunity – meaning that the effective force of transmission gradually decreases but not to the point where there are no waves. And I think there was, muddled up between those two completely different uses of the term. He described the anti-lockdown Great Barrington Declaration as “flawed at multiple levels”. This is from Peter Walker on X. Chris Whitty on the Great Barrington Declaration: “I thought it was flawed at multiple levels”. It was implicitly based on the idea of lifelong post-infection immunity, he says, which turned out to be incorrect. Whitty said he and Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, were not consulted about the “eat out to help out” scheme – even though Boris Johnson, in his witness statement to the inquiry, claims that health officials were consulted. Peter reports: Inquiry hears that Boris Johnson’s witness statement says ‘eat out to help out’ was “properly discussed” with health\/science officials. Whitty says he and Vallance were not consulted: “I think we should have been.” Speculation about the autumn statement mostly focuses on the measures that Jeremy Hunt will announce, but budgets and autumn statements coincide with the Office for Budget Responsibility publishing its latest “economic and fiscal outlook” – a long report with forecasts that serve as a healthcheck on the state of the economy – and by the end of the day it is often the OBR that produces the most startling news lines. The Financial Times says the OBR might have bad news for Rishi Sunak and Hunt on growth. In a preview it says: The measures [Hunt] announces are unlikely to forestall some unflattering growth forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, the fiscal watchdog. While GDP growth is likely to be upgraded this year, the picture is less optimistic thereafter. In March the OBR said the UK economy would expand by 1.8% in 2024 and 2.5% in 2025. The Bank of England, by contrast, has predicted near-zero growth for both years. The OBR’s 1.7% estimate of the UK’s sustainable growth rate, which is how fast the economy can grow without driving excess inflation, is also more optimistic than those of other forecasters. One of Hunt’s goals will be to convince the OBR to give him some economic credit for pro-business policies in its forecasts. Keir Starmer has said that a pause in hostilities between Israel and Hamas must be used to tackle the “urgent and unacceptable humanitarian catastrophe” in Gaza. Welcoming the deal, which is expected to involve the release of 50 hostages being held by Hamas and a number of women and teenagers from Israeli jails, the Labour leader said his party had been calling for “a substantial humanitarian pause”. He said: There must be immediate access to aid, food, water, fuel and medicine to ensure hospitals function and lives are saved. Aid and fuel need to not just get in but be distributed widely and safely. We must also use the space this pause creates to take more steps on a path towards a full cessation of hostilities rather than an escalation of violence. In his Guardian column today Rafael Behr argues the “headroom” being used by Jeremy Hunt to justify tax cuts (see 10.14am) is predicated on future spending cuts which the Conservatives, were they to win the next election, would never actually implement. He says it’s a trap for Labour. Here is an extract. The real function of the projected spending squeeze is as a trap for Labour. If the opposition rejects the Tory trajectory, it will be accused of planning a profligate spree with public money. And if it pledges adherence to impossible targets, it will enter government with its hands bound too tight to deliver prompt satisfaction to the people who voted for it. Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves have so far operated a sensible policy of not walking into traps of this kind. That approach restored swing voters’ trust in Labour as stewards of the economy. But it tests the patience of an activist base that sees reversal of austerity as a moral imperative and can smell the incipient disappointment in promises of fiscal discipline. The immediate challenge for Labour after the autumn statement is to avoid getting ensnared in a game of saying whether it would accept or reverse various specific measures. This is a balancing act that involves rejecting the premise of the question without sounding too evasive; refusing to dance to a Tory tune when the whole event is choreographed by the government. And here is Rafael’s column in full. And Jeremy Hunt will freeze alcohol duty in the autumn statement, the Sun has been told. The Financial Times has splashed this morning on a report saying Jeremy Hunt will make the “full expensing” tax relief system for businesses permanent in the autumn statement. It says: The scheme, which was due to expire in 2026, allows a company to immediately deduct all of its spending on IT equipment, plant or machinery from taxable profits. Extending it was a crucial demand of business groups. Officials claimed Hunt’s permanent extension would give the UK one of the world’s most generous capital allowance regimes. One said the move would be the “biggest business tax cut in modern British history”. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility in March said the temporary version of the £9bn-a-year full expensing policy would boost business investment by as much as 3 per cent a year during its initial three-year period. Here is Phillip Inman’s guide to what to expect in the autumn statement. Harriet Baldwin, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons Treasury committee, told GB News that she thinks Jeremy Hunt has “headroom” of around £20bn to use for tax cuts. She said: If you look at the numbers that the Office for Budget Responsibility has been publishing each month, we think that there’s probably about £20bn of headroom and that’s because you and I, through those frozen tax levels and also businesses, we have actually ended up paying more tax this year than was planned in last year’s budget. So I think that today gives the chancellor an opportunity to give some of that back to the hard-working businesses and people of this country so that we can grow the economy more rapidly next year. For an alternative take on headroom, this is from the journalist James Ball. The “headroom” you’re hearing about – the one to allow for tax cuts – is almost entirely fictional. It’ll be predicated on real-terms cuts to services in the next parliamentary term that no-one thinks are deliverable, at all. It’s a stunt. Prof Sir Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England and chief medical adviser for the UK, is still giving evidence to the Covid inquiry this morning. I’m mostly focused on the autumn statement, but my colleague Peter Walker is following the Whitty evidence, and he has posted these on X. We’re back with Chris Whitty at the Covid inquiry, and still in mid-March 2020. Even then with 500+ UK cases, Whitty says, many in No 10 still did not realise how fast things would move: “This was a lot of people really not getting what exponential growth was going to mean.” We’re now onto the idea of herd immunity, which Whitty says was misunderstood by many. It would be “inconceivable” to have it as a policy goal, and would have brought “extraordinarily high loss of life”, while v possibly not even doing what it was meant to. Whitty on herd immunity: “My view is it was clearly a ridiculous goal of policy, and a dangerous one, and lots of what was said [about it] could have led to considerable confusion, and did.” Chris Whitty says he sent WhatsApps to a group including Boris Johnson, Matt Hancock and officials urging people to not discuss herd immunity: “Frankly there was a lot of chatter by people who at best half understood the issues.” Cabinet ministers were told what would be in the autumn statement when they met at Downing Street this morning. They don’t talk to journalists as they leave, but judging by the pictures, they seemed rather pleased by what they had heard. Government ministers don’t normally look this cheerful. Good morning. Today Jeremy Hunt will deliver his second autumn statement since (like his old boss David Cameron) he made a totally unexpected return to cabinet, appointed chancellor as Liz Truss’s premiership was in its death throes. After he delivered his first one just over a year ago, the Guardian’s report led on Britain facing the biggest hit to living standards on record after Hunt announced £30bn of delayed spending cuts and £25bn of backdated tax increases. The Tory papers gave it probably the most negative coverage for any fiscal statement from a Conservative chancellor in modern times. Almost anything today would get a better reception. But in fact, if the advance briefing is reliable, Hunt is on course to deliver a statement that will get a dramatically better reception. As Larry Elliott and Pippa Crerar report in their preview, he will announce cuts to personal taxes, and a significant raft of pro-business measures. Here are some of the front pages. Rishi Sunak and Conservative MPs hope that this will be a turning point in his party’s fortunes. In a speech on Monday, he in effect announced his party’s election strategy, saying it would be a choice between “a Conservative party that is delivering lower taxes because we have now halved inflation and control spending, or a Labour party that’s just going to borrow an enormous amount more, not having learned the lessons at all of not just the last 10 years, but of the last two years, and continue with the same failed prescription, which is more government, more borrowing, more spending”. But one autumn statement cannot undo the impact of decisions taken over one year, or four years, or 13 years. And, as Torsten Bell, head of the Resolution Foundation thinktank has pointed out, you should never talk about tax cuts without explaining the context. Short version: you’re not ‘cutting taxes’ if you raise people’s taxes a lot and then given them back a little This is a point Labour will be making. In a statement released overnight, Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said: After 13 years of economic failure under the Conservatives, working people are worse off. Prices are still rising in the shops, energy bills are up and mortgage payments are higher after the Conservatives crashed the economy. The 25 Tory tax rises since 2019 are the clearest sign of economic failure, with households paying £4,000 more in tax each year than they did in 2010. The Conservatives have become the party of high tax because they are the party of low growth. Nothing the chancellor says or does in his autumn statement can change their appalling record. Under Keir Starmer’s leadership, the Labour party has changed. Labour is now the party of fiscal responsibility, we are the party of business and we are the only party with a plan to make working people better off. Today we will be focusing almost exclusively on the autumn statement. Graeme Wearden will be joining me on the blog later and we will be covering the statement in full, and providing reaction and analysis. Here is the agenda. 8.30am: Rishi Sunak chairs cabinet, where Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, briefs colleagues on the autumn statement. 12pm: Sunak faces Keir Starmer at PMQs. 12.30pm: Hunt presents his autumn statement to the Commons. 2.30pm: Richard Hughes, chair of the Office for Budget Responsibility, holds a press conference on the OBR’s forecasts.

       "     'bodyText': 'Rishi Sunak would almost certainly have known scientists were worried about his “eat out to help out” scheme during the pandemic, Sir Patrick Vallance has said, directly contradicting the prime minister’s evidence to the Covid inquiry. My colleague Peter Walker has a summary of the main points from Vallance’s evidence. The inquiry has just published Vallance’s 241-page witness statement on its website. It includes this nugget. (The CMO is the chief medical officer, Prof Sir Chris Whitty.) Rishi Sunak has hinted at business tax cuts to boost economic growth as he promised to reduce the tax burden “carefully and sustainably” and “over time”. China’s growing role in international development marks a systemic global shift that will require robust challenge by Britain if its interests are threatened, a UK government white paper on aid has warned. Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, has identified 55 projects across the UK that will get funding worth a total of £1bn from the levelling up fund. The full list of projects from the fund’s round 3 allocation is here. The UK trade secretary, Kemi Badenoch, has been accused of quietly killing off a funding stream for small businesses that had helped fashion brands such as Paul Smith and Vivienne Westwood launch their products at global trade fairs. Despite reports that 11th hour consideration is being given to a range of ideas, the key points of what Jeremy Hunt will unveil on Wednesday was finalised last week, Conservative MPs believe. Those from the party’s centrist wing are also feeling confident. One said: People would be concerned if we were pursing things for what are essentially ideological reasons which, as we saw earlier this year, can have unintended consequences. The good news is that is not Rishi Sunak or Jeremy Hunt’s style. We’re keenly aware that we have been through a period that damaged the party’s reputation for economic competence, so steadying the ship is really important. The One Nation Caucus, which represents 106 Tory MPs, published a report today making a case for how the autumn statement could reclaim undecided voters by calling for greater aid for first-time homebuyers and simplifying tax rates to create a new lower top rate Downing Street has denied reports (see 10.04am) that the cabinet is split over the legislation being prepared in response to last week’s supreme court judgment on the Rwanda policy. Asked if Rishi Sunak was finding it hard to get ministers to agree a joint approach, the PM’s spokesperson told reporters: No. The prime minister was very clear about the approach the government is taking. He’s working very closely with members of cabinet on the details of that following the judgment. Samuel Jacobs, counsel for the TUC, is asking questions now. He asks about an entry in Vallance’s diary for 6 August 2020. In it Vallance quotes Boris Johnson as saying he just wants pupils back in school and is “no longer taking this Covid excuse stuff”. Q: Did you think the PM was being reckless? Vallance says he was focused on evidence-based plans. He thought the government needed various options. These are difficult questions, he says. He says you need to plan for school openings and closures. Jacobs then shows another diary extract from 16 September 2020 in which he quotes Johnson as saying “maybe we should blame ourselves”. Vallance describes that as “a rare moment of truthfulness” and he talks of “complete chaos over schools”. Asked why he wrote that, Vallance says he cannot remember. But it must have been what he felt that night, he says. Jacobs shows another diary extract, from 3 January 2021. It describes schools policy as a “complete mess” and blames the Department for Education. Again, Vallance says he cannot recall exactly what this was referring to. But he says he remembers being very worried at the time about the situation in London. Jacobs shows a final entry, from 11 June 2020, in which Vallance refers to Jonathan Slater, the permanent secretary at the Department for Education, saying Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, should be kept away from policy development, but given an “illusion of ownership”. Vallance quotes Boris Johnson as seeming to endorse this. Asked to elaborate on the relationship between No 10 and the DfE, Vallance says he was not an expert on how government departments related to each other. When Jacobs puts it to him that this reflects badly on Williamson, Vallance says No 10 seemed to be saying things like this about quite a lot of people. That’s the end of the hearing for today. The inquiry is back tomorrow at 10am, with Prof Sir Chris Whitty giving evidence. Vallance is now being questioned by Rajiv Menon, counsel for three groups representing children. Menon asks about a note in Vallance’s diary. He does not show the extract on screen, but he reads it out. Vallance said: Sage pushing for “can’t we exempt children from rule of 6”. We said no. Not unless CMO wanted to revisit. Menon asks Vallance to explain this. Vallance says he thinks this refers to Sage (the Scientific advisory group for emergencies) wanting to exempt children from the rule of six, but the Cabinet Office not wanting to reopen the policy. And he says the scientists did not really approve of the rule of six anyway. He says: We didn’t actually think that that had an enormous basis on anything. He says it was not possible to say why meeting in groups of six might be acceptable, but not in groups of eight or 10. The fewer contacts you had, the less the risk of transmission, he says. Back at the Covid inquiry Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s former chief scientific adviser, is now being questioned by Philip Dayle, counsel for the Federation of Ethnic Minority Healthcare Organisations. Dayle asks Vallance about an entry in his diary where he describes a press conference, and says he and his colleagues had agreed in advance not to discuss ethnic disparities in Covid deaths. Vallance says that is because, at that stage, they were still trying to establish what was causing these disparities. Rain Newton-Smith, the director general of the CBI, is putting questions to Hunt. She says the last decade has been dismal for growth. Hunt says productivity in the UK is 15% lower than in Germany. That means German workers produce in four days what British workers produce in five days. That is not because Germans work harder than Britons, says Hunt. And he says the UK has a better record for innovation. But Germany is better at developing skills, he says. They have a better system for technical innovation. He says in the autumn statement he will announce measures to unlock business investment. And there will also be an overhaul of the planning system, he says. Turning away from the Covid inquiry, Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, is now taking part in a Q&amp;A at a CBI conference. Hunt starts by claiming that his autumn statement is not yet finalised, so he is still open to suggestions. He says, now inflation is coming under control, the government can “start to shake off some of the defeatism and pessimism” about Britain. He says he expected ridicule when he said he wanted Britain to be the next Silicon Valley. But, outside the US, it has the best universities and the best financial sector, he says. Weatherby shows an extract from Vallance’s diary for 11 October 2020. This was in the period when a second lockdown was being debated, but resisted by the PM and other ministers. Vallance complains about ministers being “as meek as mice”. And he describes what was happening as a “massive abrogation of responsibility”. Q: Is that your view? Vallance says it is what he thought that night. Pete Weatherby KC, counsel for Covid Bereaved Families for Justice, is asking questions now. He starts by asking Sir Patrick Vallance to confirm that the Eat out to help out scheme would have increased the number of Covid deaths. Vallance accepts that. O’Connor showed the inquiry some excerpts from notes taken by Vallance ahead of the second lockdown. On 26 October 2020 Vallance complained about Boris Johnson being “so inconsistent”. On 28 October Johnson was still resisting lockdown. And on 30 October Vallance said Johnson had still not defined his aims. The “good innings” and “lack of leadership” extract from Vallance’s diary shown to the Covid inquiry (see 3.05pm) also quotes Vallance quoting Dominic Cummings (DC), the PM’s chief adviser at the time, saying, “Rishi [Sunak] thinks just let people die and that’s okay.” This was 25 October 2020. Sunak was chancellor at the time. O’Connor is now asking about the events leading up to the second lockdown in the autumn of 2020. He shows several extracts from Vallance’s diary in which Vallance describes Boris Johnson resisting pressure for tougher measures. O’Connor refers to Johnson talking about being willing to let Covid rip. Asked if that was accurate, Vallance accepts that – but points out that Johnson may well have said the following day that he wanted no deaths at all. In one extract for 25 October 2020 Vallance quotes Johnson as saying it does not matter if more elderly people die because “they’ve had a good innings”. Vallance recalls feeling, at the end of a meeting with Johnson, there was a “complete lack of leadership”. Q: Is that still your view now? Vallance says it must have felt as if there was a complete lack of leadership. Reading the extract, he says it “feels like quite a shambolic day”. Back at the inquiry O’Connor quotes an extract from Vallance’s diary in which Vallace says Matt Hancock “explained things well for once”. Several witnesses to the inquiry have been bitterly critical of Hancock, health secretary at the time. O’Connor says there are many references to Hancock in Vallance’s diary. He says he does not want to go through them all, but he says other witnesses found Hancock untrustworthy and unreliable, and he asks Vallance what he thought of Hancock. Vallance replies: I think he had a habit of saying things which he didn’t have a basis for. And he would say them too enthusiastically, too early, without the evidence to back them up, and then have to backtrack from them, days later. I don’t know to what extent that was over-enthusiasm versus deliberate. I think a lot of it was over-enthusiasm, but he definitely said things which surprised me because I knew the evidence base wasn’t there. Q: So he said things that were not true? Yes, says Vallance. David Cameron, or Lord Cameron of Chipping Norton, has just taken his seat in the Lords. Sky News has the clip. O’Connor also showed the inquiry an extract from Vallance’s diary in which Vallance accused the Treasury of “pure dogma”. On 26 October 2021 Vallance wrote: Economic predictions. HMT [the Treasury] saying economy nearly back to normal and plan B would cost £18bn. No evidence, no transparency, pure dogma and wrong throughout. I did think there was a lack of transparency on the economic side and it was difficult to know exactly what modelling had been done and what input there had been to various assertions and comments made. O’Connor shows the inquiry an extract from Vallance’s diary in which Vallance says the key lesson from lockdown was that you needed to go earlier and harder than you would want to. O’Connor is now asking about the No 10 press conferences. He shows the inquiry an extract from Vallance’s diary in which Vallance says he did not seek to have a role at press conferences. Q: Were you concerned this compromised the quality of your advice? Vallance says he thought it was helpful for him to be there explaining the science. But he says he became concerned when questions were asked about policy. Normally ministers would answer the policy questions, he says. But he accepts that people may have assumed the advisers were there to endorse the policy. He says, on balance, he thinks it was probably beneficial overall having him and other science advisers there. But if he had been told he could not do any more press conferences, “I would not have lost any sleep over it,” he says. The Covid inquiry’s afternoon session has started. Andrew O’Connor, counsel for the inquiry, is asking about suggestions that there should have been an economic version of Sage (the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) to conduct economic modelling. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s former chief scientific adviser, says he thinks there should be an academic centre for pandemic preparedness in the UK. It should be very multi-disciplinary, he says. It should include economists, who could model the economic impact of interventions like lockdowns, he says. But he says he would not be in favour of getting Sage to do economic modelling itself. He says that would lead to it having to take decisions, balancing health and economics, which involved trade-offs which should be determined by ministers. And, given the uncertainties in pandemic modelling and economic modelling, what would come out would be “one almighty uncertainty”. But he says he would be in favour of having a standalone “economic Sage”, providing advice on the economic impact of pandemic measures. He says he would be in favour of that, if the Treasury wanted it. In the morning session the Covid inquiry was also shown an entry from Sir Patrick Vallance’s diary for 20 September 2020 in which he records Boris Johnson complaining about people wearing masks and speculating about people (Britons? human beings? – it is not clear) being “too shit to get our act together”. It says: 5 hr of meetings with the PM. He came back from Battle of Britain memorial service and was distressed by seeing everyone separated and in masks – ‘mad and spooky, we have got to end it’. Starts challenging numbers and questioning whether they really translate into deaths. Says it is not exponential etc etc. Looked broken – head in hands a lot. ‘Is it because of the great libertarian nation we are that it spreads so much?’ ‘Maybe we are licked as a species’… ‘We are too shit to get our act together.’ We went round in circles and then the famous whiteboard emerges. Discussed Package A (mild [increase] measures) and Package C (full lockdown) and when and how to do a circuit breaker… eventually sort of agree circuit breaker and stricter measures… but PM keeps clutching at straws. Rishi Sunak has pledged to cut taxes “over time” in a speech that risks incurring the wrath of Conservative MPs impatient to see personal tax cuts announced as early as this week. However, the prime minister’s announcement of what are intended to be five new key economics priorities almost went unnoticed at an event that was overshadowed by questions about the scale and type of tax cuts the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, may make in Wednesday’s autumn statement. Britain faced a choice between a “big government” of high spending and taxes, which Sunak said was necessary in recent years, and a change in approach which would see an attempt to grow the economy through the “dynamism” of the private sector. Now that inflation had been halved, he said, the government would take long-term decisions as part of the “next phase” of the government’s economic plan following a fall in inflation to 4.6% in October. He listed them as reducing debt, cutting tax and rewarding hard work, building domestic and sustainable energy, backing British business and delivering world class education. The priorities went largely unnoticed by the media until journalists approached Downing Street afterwards and were told that they were intended to be a significant moment. They do not replace Sunak’s “five priorities” – ranging from halving inflation to “stopping the boats” – but were outlined in a speech at a north London college where the Conservative leader previewed the ways in which he is likely to differentiate his party from Labour in an election campaign. As Hunt and a range of other ministers listened in the front row, Sunak used the speech to hint at business tax cuts to boost economic growth, promising to reduce the tax burden “carefully and sustainably”. Sunak said: Now that inflation is halved and our growth is stronger, meaning revenues are higher we can begin the next phase, and turn our attention to cutting tax. We will do this in a serious, responsible way based on fiscal rules to deliver sound money and alongside the independent forecasts of the Office for Budget Responsibility. And we can’t do everything all at once. It will take discipline and we need to prioritise. But over time, we can and we will cut taxes. After the speech to an audience of local business and community leaders, Sunak claimed that the welfare system is not currently “sustainable” when asked about a possible squeeze on welfare payments in the autumn statement. Declining to “pre-empt” any announcements on Wednesday, the PM said: Our view on the welfare system is that it should be compassionate, it should be fair and it should be sustainable … With over 2 million people of working age who are not currently working, that isn’t a good situation. It’s not sustainable for the country, for taxpayers. It’s not fair. But it’s also not compassionate to write people off. In other section of his speech, Sunak sought to portray Labour as being in the pockets of trade unions and attempted to contrast his own and Hunt’s experience of being in business to his opponents, who he said “have no experience whatsoever over running a business”. Just before the hearing broke for lunch Andrew O’Connor, counsel for the inquiry, asked about eat out to help out (EOTHO) – the Treasury subsidy for restaurants in the summer of 2020, which was subsequently blamed for helping to spread the virus. Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser at the time, said that he and other scientists were not asked about it in advance. If they had been, they would have advised against, he said. “I think our advice would have been very clear on that.” O’Connor presented an extract from Vallance’s witness statement in which he says it would have been “obvious to all involved” that scientists would have said, if they had been asked, that the scheme would increase infections. O’Connor then presented an extract from Rishi Sunak’s witness statement, in which he claims that government scientists did not raise any objections with him to the EOTHO scheme. O’Connor put it to Vallance that there was “a certain inconsistency” between Vallance saying it was obvious that scientists would not have backed the scheme, and Sunak saying no one raised objections. Vallance replied: Well, we didn’t see it before it was announced and I think others in the Cabinet Office have also said they didn’t see it before it was formulated as a policy. So we weren’t involved in the run-up to it. And around that time lots of measures were being released. You’ll see repeated references in various minutes and notes and emails, and in my private notes, to our concern that people were piling on more and more things and this would come to drive R [the reproduction number] above one. I think that was discussed at cabinet as well. So I think it would have been very obvious to anyone that this was likely to cause, inevitably would cause, an increase in transmission risk. And I think that would have been known by ministers. O’Connor asked if Sunak would have known this too. Vallance said he could not recall which meetings Sunak attended. But he went on: I’d be very surprised if any minister didn’t understand that these openings carried risk. O’Connor then presented extracts from Vallance’s diary in which he describes ministers trying to sideline the scientists. In this extract, from June 2020, he says No 10 did not understand the 2- metre rule. In this extract, also from June 2020, Vallance recalls an issue where he says No 10 wanted the science “altered”. And in this extract, from July 2020, Vallance recalls Rishi Sunak, the then chancellor, talking in a meeting about the need to manage the scientists, not the virus. Sunak did not realise Chris Whitty was in the meeting too. Vallance says: In the economics meeting earlier today they didn’t realise CMO (chief medical officer Sir Chris Whitty) was there and CX (then-chancellor Rishi Sunak) said ‘It is all about handling the scientists, not handling the virus’. They then got flustered when the CMO chipped in later and they realised he had been there all along. PM blustered and waffled for five mins to cover his embarrassment. Asked about these interventions, Vallance played down the significance of them, suggesting that that was just what politicians did. He says generally the scientists were listened to. UPDATE: Vallance said: I think there were definitely periods when it was clear that the unwelcome advice we were giving was, as expected, not loved. And that meant we had to work doubly hard to make sure that the science evidence and advice was being properly heard. Now, it doesn’t surprise me that there were meetings that we were not included in, that’s normal. We were, as I said, in No 10 probably for 45 minutes or an hour, and there were things going on all day, and political decisions as well, so it’s not surprising that we were not invited to things sometimes. Vallance told the inquiry he favoured publishing the Sage minutes. O’Connor presented him with evidence from his diary showing that, when the Cabinet Office realised minutes were being published, it stopped posing questions to Sage for discussions at meetings because it did not want the public to know those options were being considered. Vallance said he favoured openness. O’Connor then showed some more extracts from Vallance’s diary about Johnson. In this one, from February 2021, Vallance says it was a “real struggle” to get Johnson to understand graphs from the Covid dashboard. And in this extract, from September 2020, Vallance records “incredulity” in the room as Johnson described the graphs as a “mirage” in a meeting. Vallance told the inquiry that Boris Johnson gave up studying science at the age of 15. He said Johnson would be the first to admit that science wasn’t his strong point. But he said it is not unusual for politicians to have a poor grasp of science. He recalled a conversation with fellow scientists from other countries where one of them spoke about how hard it was to get their minister to understand exponential curves. They all laughed, because they had all had the same experience, he said. Vallance said he thought Johnson may have deliberately pretended to misunderstand things, just as a means of checking his comprehension. But he also said a poor understanding of science was “not unusual amongst leaders in western democracies”. O’Connor asks about Boris Johnson’s understanding of scientific concepts. He shows the inquiry a series of extracts from Vallance’s diary which provide evidence of this. This extract, from May 2020, describes Johnson as being “clearly bamboozled” by modelling on schools. Here is another extract from May 2020 describing Johnson as being “confused” about different types of tests. In this extract, from June 2020, Vallance says it is “awful” watching Johnson trying to understand statistics and that he finds the difference between absolute and relative risk “almost impossible to understand”. In this extract, from July 2020, Vallance says Johnson did not understand the concept of doubling times. And this one, from September 2020, says it is difficult getting Johnson to understand graphs – even when he has seen them before. The hearing has resumed. Andrew O’Connor, counsel for the inquiry, asks about the repeated government claims that it was “following the science”. Vallance says at first he welcomed this because it meant ministers were listening to the scientists. But the phrase implied that scientists all agreed, which was not the case, he says. And it misunderstood what science is, he says. Science, by its definition, is a moving body of knowledge that tries to overturn things by testing the whole time. He says ministers need to weigh up different types of evidence. He says those are “impossible judgement calls which the science can’t make and shouldn’t make”. Here are some more lines from what Sir Patrick Vallance said to the Covid inquiry before the break. Vallance said that in the early days of the pandemic three scenarios were envisaged. He said: In a sense, there were three broad possibilities. One: that the disease could be contained and eliminated. The second: that the disease would run wild and not be controlled at all and people would make no effort to do anything. And the third was to try and control it in some way to minimise the impact. And we didn’t know at that stage whether it was fully containable or not, but once it breaks out – and by the way, the breakout of containment domestically is dependent on the infrastructure you have, so the test [and] trace mostly – but once it breaks out, then my understanding from the beginning was the government did not want to do anything other than it didn’t want to let it run riot. It didn’t think it could get to zero Covid, and therefore it was to control it and suppress the numbers in reference to the NHS being overwhelmed. That was the closest we got to understanding the aims, coupled with a desire from the government not to impose overburdence and restrictions on liberty. He said in his witness statement that no minister gave an estimate for what might be an acceptable number of deaths or infections “other than by reference to avoiding the NHS being overwhelmed”, the inquiry heard. He said it was hard to get clarity on how many cases the NHS could cope with before it was overwhelmed. He said: What we did know was that the NHS runs at pretty much 100% capacity, which is quite unlike most other countries. So we knew that the NHS capacity was likely to be very full anyway. And trying to get precise numbers on ICU beds and occupancy of other types of high dependency beds was pretty difficult during February and I think it culminated in a meeting, which I think I asked to be set up the first day of March, with the NHS modellers to try and see if we can resolve this logjam. He said in his witness statement the first lockdown came a week too late, the inquiry heard. The inquiry is now having a 15 minute break. O’Connor then asked Vallance about Prof Sir Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, and he put it to Vallance that Whitty was more keen than he was to delay the introducing of lockdown-type measures. This extract says in January 2020 Whitty thought Covid could be contained. This extract says in February 2020 Whitty was “worried about pulling trigger too soon”. And in this extract, from February 2021, Vallance says Whitty was “a delayer”. Asked about Whitty’s stance, Vallance says it is important to remember that, as chief medical officer, Whitty was very aware of the health downsides of a lockdown, for example, from people not getting treatment for other conditions. Back at the Covid inquiry, Andrew O’Connor, counsel for the inquiry, is asking Vallance about the period in February and early March 2020, when the government was working out how to respond to Covid. O’Connor shows an extract from the witness statement from Ben Warner, a No 10 aide. Warner said the government should have developed plans for a lockdown earlier. Vallance says the government was not in a position to implement some of the NPIs (non-pharmaceutical interventions – lockdowns, social distancing, masks etc). Q: Should Sage have been pushing for these measures earlier? Vallance says the scientists thought these measures would be necessary. But he accepts they were wrong about timing. Where we were wrong [was] our belief that we understood when to do that. He says the data coming in on 14 and 15 March showed that Covid was much more advanced than they thought. The NPIs were needed urgently, he says. He says there had been a data problem. Here are tweets from journalists on the highlights from the Sunak speech and Q&amp;A. From ITV’s Robert Peston The Chancellor will DEFINITELY cut personal income taxes on Wednesday, income tax or national insurance. If he doesn’t the PM will look incredibly foolish for saying this morning, repeatedly, that the moment has come to start cutting taxes, because he knows most voters don’t see the extension of capital allowances for business (though important and expensive) as tax cuts that matter to them. And Rishi Sunak is not a PM who creates expectations if he knows those expectations will be disappointed. From Robert Colvile, a Sunday Times columnist (and head of the Centre for Policy Studies, a Tory thinktank) From the BBC’s Iain Watson From my colleague Ben Quinn Q: On tax, wouldn’t it make more sense to just lower thresholds – instead of taking with one hand, and giving with the other (by reducing the headline rate). Sunak says he has taken difficult decisions on tax. Now, because he has halved inflation, and because the economy has outperformed, he is in a position to look at cutting taxes. He says, when he became PM, everyone was forecasting a recession for this year. He says, as he explained in his speech, the government will address tax cuts “seriously and responsibly”. The government will be disciplined, he says. And it will focus on supply side measures. That is the end of Sunak’s Q&amp;A. Sunak says the number of small boat crossings have fallen by a third this year. No one thought that was “remotely possible” when he made the pledge to stop the small boats, he claims. But he says he is determined to finish the job. He says he will not let a foreign court stop the UK sending planes to Rwanda. Rishi Sunak has finished his speech, and is now taking questions. He says Labour would put up borrowing by £28bn a year. That means it would not be able to cut taxes, he says. He says there will be a “clear contrast” at the election. Vallance says that some of what he was doing during Covid would have been done by anyone else in the post of government chief scientific adviser (GCSA). But he says because of his medical training, and his knowledge of vaccines (he had worked for GlaxoSmithKline before taking the GCSA job), he was probably more involved than another GCSA might have been. But he also says this does not mean that the GCSA should always be a health expert. In future, he says, climate change is likely to pose the biggest scientific challenge for the government. Rishi Sunak is delivering his economy speech now. This is from Ben Quinn, who is in the audience. We will post a summary of the speech once it is over. If possible, I will cover the Q&amp;A in full, but the speech is not being covered live by the networks. Sky News and the BBC are focusing on Vallance. In his witness statement Vallance said his private diary was “never intended to be read by anyone else”, the inquiry was told. Sir Patrick Vallance, the former government chief scientific adviser, is giving evidence to the inquiry now. He says the notes in his diary were written at the end of the day. It was a means of “decompressing”. That helped him focus on what he needed to do the following day. He says he had no intention of publishing them. He did not even look at them again. He says he felt the world had “had enough” of Covid memoirs. I had no intention whatsoever of these ever seeing the light of day or me looking at them again, and sort of felt the world probably had enough of books and reflections of people’s thoughts during Covid … At the end of each day, often quite late in the evening, I would just spend a few minutes jotting down some thoughts from that day, and things and reflections, and did it as a way to get that, in a sense, out of the way so that I could concentrate on the following day. These were private thoughts. They were instant reflections from a day. And once they were written, I actually never looked at them again. They were put in a drawer and that was that. I certainly had no intention of doing anything else with them either. He did not even show them to his family, he says. “They were very much instant thoughts,” he says. Q: Did you take notes at the time? Vallance says he might have written some things during the day, and others at night. He says his handwriting is very poor. Q: You sometimes quote people directly. Did you note the quotes at the time, or from memory afterwards? It could be either, says Vallance. Andrew O’Connor, counsel for the inquiry, shows extracts from Vallance’s witness statement describing them. UPDATE: Vallance also said he agreed with some of the points he made in his diaries, but had changed his mind on other points. He said: Some of it, I look back and think: ‘Well, that seems like a sort of sensible series of reflections over that period’. Others I look back and I can see I might have written something one day and then two days later written something that said: ‘Actually, I don’t agree with myself on that’, which may have been how somebody had behaved or somebody made an observation. So they were very much instant thoughts. There has been speculation that in the autumn statement on Wednesday Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, will uprate benefits for next year in line with the CPI inflation figure for October, which was 4.6%, rather than the figure for September, 6.7%, the month normally used as the benchmark for annual uprating. Charities and campaigners claim this could cut benefits payments next year by £2bn. Steve Webb, the former Lib Dem MP and pensions minister in the coalition government, has just posted this on X. He highlights an announcement from the DWP about a publication it is releasing on Wednesday. Webb says this implies the government will uprate in line with the October figure. Benefit cuts alert - DWP just issued a notice (see below) of an ‘ad hoc’ publication on benefit upratings on Wednesday - in years where they simply pay inflation, they don’t do this. Looks like this will be their defensive doc, justifying using the more recent inflation figure. It is a big week for government economic policy, but it is also a big week for the Covid inquiry, where the government’s two most important scientific advisers during the pandemic – Sir Patrick Vallance and Prof Sir Chris Whitty – are giving evidence on how the government responded as the crisis escalated. Vallance starts at 10.30am. Vallance, who was the government’s chief scientific adviser at the time, kept a private diary during this period and some short extracts have already been released. We will probably hear further highlights today. From what we have seen, it is a much better read than the Matt Hancock “diary” and some of it makes gruesome reading for Boris Johnson and his colleagues. In a thread on X starting here, the BBC’s Jim Reed has flagged up some of the excerpts published already. Here is the one from August 2020 where Vallance describes “quite a bonkers set of exchanges” in a WhatsApp group including Johnson. The PM was “obsessed with older people accepting their fate and letting the young get on with life”, Vallance records. And here is the entry from December 2020 when he quotes Johnson as saying that Tory MPs think Covid is “just nature’s way of dealing with old people” and that he tends to agree. Rishi Sunak is considering blocking a key human rights law to help force through plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda amid growing pressure from rightwing Conservative MPs, Rajeev Syal reports. The Times has more on the row that this plan has generated within cabinet. In his story Steven Swinford reports: Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, is pushing for emergency legislation to disapply the Human Rights Act and direct courts to ignore the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in asylum cases. However, cabinet ministers including James Cleverly, the home secretary, Victoria Prentis, the attorney general, and Alex Chalk, the justice secretary, are said to have reservations about a hardline approach. One senior government source described the strategy as “mad”, saying the courts would go “ballistic” and questioning whether Sunak would be willing to endorse it. Here is a round-up of what the papers are saying about the autumn statement. Steven Swinford in the Times says Jeremy Hunt is expected to cut national insurance and business taxes. Swinford says: One government source said a cut in income tax was less likely than a cut in national insurance. There are concerns over the cost, £13 billion for a 2p cut, and because it would probably increase inflation as people had more money to spend. They suggested that Hunt was more likely to cut national insurance, particularly for self-employed workers, in an attempt to stimulate growth, because it would probably be cheaper and less inflationary. The chancellor has been considering cutting inheritance tax and has assessed options including halving the rate from 40 per cent to 20 per cent. However, the issue became increasingly controversial after Labour attacked it as a tax cut for the wealthy during a cost of living crisis and some Tory MPs grew concerned. Inheritance tax cuts appear increasingly likely to be left until the budget in the spring. The chancellor is expected to reduce business taxes. He is likely to extend “full expensing” — a tax relief allowing businesses to offset their investments against corporate tax — having concluded that the policy is less inflationary, and expensive, than previously thought. But George Parker in the Financial Times says Tory MPs are hoping Hunt will announce a cut in the basic rate of income tax. Parker says: The chancellor has shelved plans to cut inheritance tax until next year, raising Tories’ hopes that he could instead honour Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s promise to start cutting the 20p basic rate of income tax. Sunak said last year that he wanted to lower the rate to 16 per cent by the end of the next parliament. A 1p cut from next April would be seen by MPs as a downpayment on that pledge. It would cost about £6bn, according to HMRC estimates. Tory strategists had initially planned to hold back headline-grabbing income tax cuts until the spring Budget — closer to the likely date of the next election — but the party’s dire opinion poll ratings have put pressure on Hunt to act now … A senior Tory insider said: “They’ve been looking at a 1p income tax cut. Number 10 needs a silver bullet. They need to do something to calm down the right of the party.” Hunt declined to rule out an income-tax cut. And David Churchill in the Daily Mail says much the same. Churchill says: Treasury officials have been examining how feasible a 1p or 2p cut would be ahead of Wednesday’s statement. They have ruled out relaxing the frozen thresholds around the levies. Cutting income tax by 2p in the pound would cost £13 billion to £14 billion a year and save UK households around £450 annually on average. It would also give the Tories a much-needed boost ahead of the election, expected to be in autumn next year, as it trails Labour by 20-plus points in the polls. Good morning. After one of the most intense weeks for political news since Rishi Sunak became PM (Suella Braverman being sacked, David Cameron returning, the rest of the reshuffle, and the supreme court’s Rwanda judgment), we’ve got another news-packed five days starting now, mostly focused on the autumn statement on Wednesday. The Guardian doesn’t normally agree with Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg on anything, but the former business secretary has summed up what’s at stake in this quote for the Daily Mail. We’ve had the net zero relaunch, the party conference relaunch, the King’s Speech relaunch and the reshuffle relaunch, none of which has made a difference to the polls. We now need the autumn statement relaunch which will actually connect with voters. Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, hinted yesterday that the announcement could include personal tax cuts and there is a lot of speculation in the papers today, particularly the pro-Tory ones, about what this might involve. Most of the reporting is somewhat speculative, but this morning a junior Treasury minister, Gareth Davies, has been giving interviews and on at least one issue he was able to be categorical. This morning the Daily Telegraph has a report based on what John Glen told Cambridge University Conservatives at a private meeting last month when he was chief secretary to the Treasury. (He was moved sideways to paymaster general in the Cabinet Office in the reshuffle.) Glen suggested rich pensioners should stop getting the winter fuel allowance. The money would be better spent on addressing child poverty, he said. In his story, Ben Riley-Smith quotes Glen as saying: I think we also need to come to terms with the fact that the triple lock is very expensive and how sustainable is that going forward in terms of pensions and all the other benefits? Because my mother, she’s not very rich but she’s perfectly comfortable. She just texted me today aged 75 to say ‘I’ve just heard about my £500 winter fuel payment’ and I’m just like ‘you don’t need that’. But finding a mechanism to try and ration that [the winter fuel payment] is very difficult because our HMRC system will look at household incomes. These are the sorts of mechanics of government you’ve got to look at. Is it better if we spent more of that money on child poverty? It probably is. But these are the sorts of things I think we need to look at. Good idea, you might think. But it is not going to happen. Davies told Sky News this morning: We are not going to be touching the winter fuel allowance … We will always stand by our pensioners to ensure they have a dignified retirement and security in retirement. There will be more on the economy because Rishi Sunak is giving a speech on the subject this morning, and taking questions from journalists. I will also be focusing quite a lot on the Covid inquiry where Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s former chief scientific adviser, is giving evidence. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Rishi Sunak speaks at the opening of a global food security summit where he is due to launch the international development white paper. 10.30am: Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s former chief scientific adviser, gives evidence to the Covid inquiry. His evidence is due to last all day. Mid morning: Sunak gives a speech on the economy and holds a Q&amp;A with journalists. 11.30am: No 10 holds a lobby briefing. 2.30pm: David Cameron is introduced as a peer in the House of Lords. 4.45pm: Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, speaks at the County Councils Network conference. Also, David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, is on a visit to Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories. If you want to contact me, do try the “send us a message” feature. You’ll see it just below the byline – on the left of the screen, if you are reading on a laptop or a desktop. This is for people who want to message me directly. I find it very useful when people message to point out errors (even typos – no mistake is too small to correct). Often I find your questions very interesting, too. I can’t promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either in the comments below the line; privately (if you leave an email address and that seems more appropriate); or in the main blog, if I think it is a topic of wide interest.'},\n",

       "     'bodyText': 'Relatives of British citizens recently evacuated from Gaza and those waiting to return to the UK have criticised the government’s repatriation guidance, as UK officials continue to support nationals crossing into Egypt. Ahmad Abou-Foul’s family safely crossed from Gaza into Egypt on 3 November. He said they were “shocked” after arriving in Cairo when UK immigration officers advised the individuals with British passports to return to the UK with their children, and once there, start a reunification process for their Palestinian spouses. “They were asking us to split a four-month-old from his mother – and a one-year-old and two-year-old,” said Abou-Foul, an NHS surgeon from Birmingham, whose 16 relatives – including young children – returned to the UK on Saturday. “We were shocked. Probably they didn’t have a plan; this is what we felt,” he said. After enduring weeks of Israeli bombardment that has killed more than 12,000 people, the family asked officials why they were being treated differently than in recent evacuations, such as those from Sudan, Ukraine and Afghanistan. Abou-Foul said the family were told that each situation was different. Abou-Foul paid £16,000 in visa fees for three adults and two children. The family was not given any guidance or informed of any fee waivers, he said, and were asked to arrange their return at their own cost. The Guardian understands there have been repatriation cases in which individuals have had visa fees waived. “What was the reason for us to be given this option?” said Abou-Foul, adding he did not think it was intentional but due to insufficient planning by the UK government. “Why weren’t we supported by the FCDO [Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office]? “If I have to do it again, I will do it again, because at that time I would have paid everything I have to get my family to safety.” While the family is among the hundreds of foreign nationals who have escaped Israel’s airstrikes and the spiralling humanitarian crisis, more than 2 million people in Gaza, almost half of whom are children, remain under siege after Hamas militants killed at least 1,200 people and abducted 240 hostages in a surprise attack on Israel on 7 October. The Rafah crossing first opened on 1 November to allow specific groups of foreign nationals and the seriously wounded to leave. By early November, more than half of the British nationals seeking to escape Gaza for Egypt had managed to do so. The Guardian understands that transportation to Cairo and two nights’ of accommodation is being provided to British nationals and their dependants. While flights are not being facilitated, loans are being offered in a temporary exchange for passports. “It’s not easy to afford the cost of the four tickets,” said a British national in Cairo who asked to remain anonymous. “I can’t think how I am going to pay back the loan while my medical centre is closed, maybe damaged, and we left everything in Gaza.” For six weeks, the family lived under Israeli bombardment, moving from northern Gaza to Khan Younis, the biggest city in the south, where tens of thousands of people have been evacuated in recent weeks. After evacuating from Gaza seven days ago, the family has extended their stay in Egypt as they wait for a visa to be processed for a family member without a British passport. Tessa Gregory, a human rights team partner at the law firm Leigh Day, said: “Our client and her British family who were living in Gaza have fled a war zone where they have survived desperate conditions and witnessed unspeakable violence. “In these circumstances the British government should be doing everything within its power to get the family back to the UK as quickly as possible so they can start to rebuild their lives. “We hope the Foreign Office will now reconsider its policy and cover the costs of flights for this family.” A government spokesperson said: “The safety of British nationals remains a top priority. “We are working at pace to support British families who have crossed the border into Egypt, making sure any dependants who need a visa can apply for one and that appropriate checks are carried out in a timely manner.”'},\n",

       "     'bodyText': 'Dressed in a crimson velvet cloak, trimmed and lined with white ermine, and flanked by two senior Conservative peers, Lord Cameron of Chipping Norton, the new foreign secretary, will be formally introduced into the House of Lords on Monday amid all the colour and splendour that the second chamber affords. The former prime minister, who everyone thought had bid a final farewell to Westminster in 2016 after the humiliation of the Brexit referendum, will then deliver his maiden speech the following day in a debate on international trade. It could well go down as the political comeback of the year, if not the decade. The imagery of the return of an ex-PM who left under such a cloud, and was subsequently embroiled in a major lobbying scandal, may not be perfect for Rishi Sunak, as he attempts his latest leadership reset. But something had to be done. The Tories were in a death spiral. “Suella [Braverman] was mad and taking us down,” said one Conservative MP. “This was what Rishi came up with. It may help, it may not.” The decision stunned everyone in the Tory party, including good friends of the former occupant of No 10, and those who had served in his governments. “David always had a thing, I thought, about not wanting to be in the Lords. Yes, I was surprised,” said one ally, now in the upper house. “Like Major, Blair, Brown, he didn’t seem to want to do it, having been prime minister.” Negotiations on the comeback were kept as the tightest of secrets in Downing Street. Only two or three people are said to have known anything, apart from Sunak and Cameron himself. Former Tory leader William Hague is believed to have been the key interlocutor, and to have convinced Cameron that a stint as foreign secretary (Hague had been in the job under Cameron) would be a good way to restore his reputation at home and abroad and conclude his career on a high note. So when the news broke, it came as a bolt from the blue. Last Sunday morning the defence secretary, Grant Shapps, who was completely in the dark at the time, was sent out on the TV media round by No 10 and clearly felt he had to put on a partial defence of Braverman in case she survived any reshuffle. She was facing a barrage of criticism for having inflamed tensions at the pro-Palestinian march the day before, after accusing the police of leftwing bias. The first Shapps would know of the reshuffle next day, in which Braverman was unceremoniously fired and Cameron installed, was when he saw the ex-PM strolling up Downing Street. Sunak and his team knew it was all a gamble. They were aware that the Tory parliamentary party these days is far more rightwing than it had been in Cameron’s time. The 2019 election result saw many more rightwing pro-Brexit MPs arrive, particularly from “red wall” seats. But among southern and metropolitan voters, Sunak and his allies thought Cameron would play well. Within hours of the reshuffle, groups of rightwing Tory backbenchers were, however, meeting in the Commons to discuss both setbacks for their wing of the party: the loss of standard-bearer Braverman, and the return of the remainer and social liberal Cameron. James Cleverly, an affable moderate, had made way at the foreign office and taken Braverman’s place. “Rishi’s Big Throw of the Dice,” said the Daily Mail next day. Sunak was risking a “revolt on the Tory right” the paper added, while noting, more positively, that “in a bold move” Sunak had recalled ex-TV presenter Esther McVey to be “minister for common sense” in charge of “rooting out woke culture”. By Tuesday, Downing Street minds were turning to the announcement, due the following morning, from the supreme court on the legality of the government’s policy of sending asylum seekers to Rwanda, which had been championed by Braverman and had got bogged down in legal challenges. It was the cornerstone of Sunak’s entire immigration policy. One of the five pledges on which he has staked his reputation is to “stop the boats”. As No 10 wargamed how to respond to the possible scenarios, depending on how the judgment went, there was also nervousness about what Braverman might do. After her sacking, she had promised to say more in due course. As it turned out, Braverman decided to go for broke on the afternoon before the supreme court gave its verdict, and in terms that astounded everyone. Even experienced Westminster hands had never seen a letter like it. On page after blistering page, she tore into the prime minister, accusing him of having “manifestly and repeatedly failed” to honour promises he had supposedly made to her when she agreed to back his leadership campaign last year. Braverman’s support for Sunak had been vital in preventing Boris Johnson from mounting a comeback. “Either your distinctive style of government means you are incapable of doing so or as I must surely conclude now, you never had any intention of keeping your promises,” she wrote. And in what seemed to be an attempt to pre-empt a negative judgment by the supreme court, she accused Sunak of failing to prepare for that eventuality, and of “magical thinking” about potential future challenges he might mount to keep the Rwanda plan in play. So extreme was her language and so intemperate, that most Tory MPs thought the letter had damaged her more than Sunak, ending any remote chance she may once have had of becoming leader. “When you write a poison pen letter, you do it in three paragraphs, not three pages,” said one senior backbencher. “It just showed that she was not fit to be home secretary in the first place, let alone leader.” But – while Braverman was imploding – none of this was playing well for Sunak or the Tories. The latest reset was merely highlighting party divisions, not healing them. The media coverage was all about Conservative party and government turmoil and splits. Labour’s own problems, over Keir Starmer’s refusal to call for a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, were attracting less coverage than they otherwise would have had, allowing the Labour leader partially off the hook. It was also escaping no one that Sunak now seemed to be attempting to reset his government every few weeks, whether it was at the party conference, through the king’s speech or by conducting blockbuster reshuffles. And each reset seemed out of sync, in policy terms, with the last one. They did not build on each other, but seemed increasingly contradictory. In September, at the Tory conference in Manchester, Sunak had become the “change” prime minister, differentiating himself from the Conservative PMs who had gone before him – including Cameron. To make the point he had dumped the Birmingham to Manchester leg of HS2, a decision Cameron and his chancellor, George Osborne, both condemned in public only a few weeks ago because they had advanced HS2 and believed in it. As Starmer would put it at prime minister’s questions, “his [Sunak’s] big idea is to keep turning his government on and off at the wall and hoping that we see signs of life”. After 13 years it was not, however, proving easy to find a way forward whichever way Sunak looked: forwards or back, left or right. Wednesday morning offered a sudden, if brief, ray of hope for Sunak and his team as it emerged that inflation had dropped to 4.6% in the year to October, down from 6.7% the month before. The story led the BBC news for a couple of hours. But then the supreme court delivered its unanimous verdict. A senior Labour frontbencher could not believe the party’s good fortune. “They [the Tories] had had their best news for months, even years, and then … the Rwanda decision.” The supreme court ruling was the cue for even worse Tory bloodletting than had come before. The court found that the Rwanda policy was unlawful because migrants faced a real risk of being sent back to their home countries where they could be mistreated. This would be in breach of the European convention on human rights (ECHR), which is enshrined in the Human Rights Act. Sunak’s entire immigration policy looked in shreds. Rightwing MPs started calling for the UK to reassess its position in the international legal system. Danny Kruger, the MP for Devizes, said the scope of the ruling meant the UK’s involvement in other treaties and conventions had now to be considered. “The government should immediately announce an intention to do what is necessary to insist on our sovereignty. That means legislation to override the effect of the European court, of the European convention on human rights itself and of other conventions including the refugee convention if necessary.” Speaking after an emergency meeting of the rightwing New Conservatives group of Tory MPs, the party’s deputy chairman, Lee Anderson, said: “It’s a dark day for British people. We should just get the planes in the air right now and send them to Rwanda. People are fed up in this country. They’re fed up of being taken for a ride and paying their taxes to people who have no right to be here and are criminals. The government need to show our leadership and send them back same day.” Sunak held a press conference in Downing Street and announced he was taking the “extraordinary step” of rushing emergency legislation through to declare that Rwanda was a safe country. There would also be a new treaty with Rwanda as part of legal process to keep the policy alive. There was a sense of desperation spreading across government. The immigration minister, Robert Jenrick, appeared to stake the survival of Sunak’s government on a strategy that would in effect mean the UK challenging international law. “I don’t see a path to victory at the next general election unless we resolve this issue,” he said. The legal establishment reacted with barely concealed horror. Bar Council chair Nick Vineall said: “The Bar Council notes with grave concern the prime minister’s suggestion that legislation might be introduced, the purpose of which is apparently to deem Rwanda to be a safe country to which to return asylum seekers. “If parliament were to pass legislation the effect of which was to reverse a finding of fact made by a court of competent jurisdiction, that would raise profound and important questions about the respective role of the courts and parliament in countries that subscribe to the rule of law.” In the Commons, Cleverly suggested it would not be necessary to leave the ECHR, while later in his press briefing Sunak signalled that this would have to be an option, despite the huge knock-on effects such a move would have, not least the fact that the ECHR was central to the Good Friday agreement. “If we leave the ECHR the Good Friday agreement goes down the tubes,” said a former cabinet minister. Immediately, there were indications from senior peers that such emergency legislation would face numerous challenges in the upper house, not least because the Rwanda plan had not been in the 2019 Tory manifesto in the first place. Lucy Powell, shadow leader of the Commons, asked which bills in the recent king’s speech, which formed the basis of the last but one Sunak reset, would have to be ditched to make way for new Rwanda law. Had King Charles been wasting his time? “The ink is not even dry on the government’s king’s speech yet the prime minister is already proposing a treaty and new laws to mask their utter failure to get a grip on illegal immigration.” Tory friends of the new foreign secretary in the Lords, meanwhile, raised the question of what the newest recruit to their ranks might think: “All I know is I can’t see him wanting to leave the ECHR. If that were to become policy I think we could have a serious problem.”'},\n",

       "     'bodyText': 'Downing Street’s new game show, I’m a Celebrity, Get Me In Here, played out faultlessly on Monday. The star attraction was kept safely under wraps, with nothing given away in the run-up to the announcement. Even as the car pulled into Downing Street, no one was any the wiser. Fools like me, even when presented with the evidence of his walking up to the famous door in full public view on reshuffle day, still thought it might be a coincidence. David Cameron’s return as foreign secretary has dominated the headlines that are always generated by a government reshuffle. It has dazzled and irritated his soon-to-be-fellow peers in equal measure. On the one hand, we are delighted to have a former PM join the House of Lords – the last was Lady Thatcher, who died 10 years ago. On the other, we are annoyed by the endless WhatsApps from friends asking why we haven’t been asked to join the cabinet as well. As a friend, Cameroon and a former Cameron minister, I am obviously biased. But I think on balance he will be an asset to the government. My Tory tribe – moderate, centrist, reasonable – have been texting their relief. A Tory party that may still be in danger of going off the deep end does at least have a fighting chance to pull back from the brink and be ready to address voters’ concerns in a rational way. Cameron isn’t there just to be an effective foreign secretary. I hope he will also have a significant influence on the Tory party and domestic politics. The job of PM is a lonely one at the best of times, more so if you have only been an MP for seven years and lack a fully formed political touch. Having Cameron available for wise counsel and calm words will be invaluable to Rishi Sunak. Only a former PM will understand what he is going through. Cameron’s availability for fundraising events in Tory constituencies and appearances in the House of Commons tearoom will also be vital. The most curmudgeonly Tory MP is not immune to a bit of stardust. Of course, quite a lot of this may well just be wishful thinking on my part. There remain significant problems. For example, Sunak still managed to fudge the question of who he is and what he actually stands for. The appointment of Cameron was a massive reverse ferret from the conference speech just a month before, which disavowed Cameronism, and it should have been full-throated. Instead he appointed a minister for common sense at the same time, to try to appease the never-to-be appeased revolutionary right, signalling a continuation of the bizarre culture wars and leaving everyone still confused. Esther McVey deserves a place in cabinet – but why appoint her with this ridiculous moniker? Cameron’s appointment may just be a narrowcast to a select group of voters. There is no evidence that it will help Sunak reach out to the red wall of former Labour voters. Cameron’s appointment will wind up Brexiters, and there are quite a few remainers who still resent him. Finally, Cameron’s return was made possible only by the expulsion of Suella Braverman, which now seems likely to set off a full-blown civil war, fuelled by the supreme court ruling on Rwanda. This is something Sunak cannot duck. He may navigate a way through the immigration mess – and there is no one better than James Cleverly as home secretary to help him do that – but the right now want Sunak’s head. In heading them off, the government seems to want to make the House of Lords a scapegoat. That will put Cameron in an uncomfortable position. It’s unlikely to mean an early election – the government’s strategy is clearly to have a fight on this issue for the next 12 months before an autumn election. Having made this surprise appointment, Sunak needs to follow through on the choice he made in appointing Cameron. He must face down his rebels and show he will push through his own agenda. Otherwise he risks seeing the next Downing Street drama – Succession. Ed Vaizey was culture minister from 2010 to 2016 and now sits in the House of Lords'},\n",

       "     'bodyText': 'Fifteen government departments have been monitoring the social media activity of potential critics and compiling “secret files” in order to block them from speaking at public events, the Observer can reveal. Under the guidelines issued in each department, including the departments of health, culture, media and sport, and environment, food and rural affairs, officials are advised to check experts’ Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn accounts. They are also told to conduct Google searches on those individuals, using specific terms such as “criticism of government or prime minister”. The guidelines are designed to prevent anyone who has criticised the government in the previous three to five years from speaking at government-organised conferences and other events. In September, the Observer revealed how three early-childhood education experts discovered that the Department for Education tried to cancel invitations for them to speak at government-funded events because they were judged to have been critical of government policy. Many more education experts and school staff have since uncovered files of their critical social media posts held by the department. However, it has now become clear that the practice is widespread across government and is probably targeting large numbers of individuals. The scale of the monitoring was uncovered by human rights experts at law firm Leigh Day and shared with the Observer. The revelations will be hugely embarrassing for a Conservative party that regularly claims to champion free speech and has slammed universities for allowing students to “no platform” experts with whom they disagree. Tessa Gregory, partner at Leigh Day, who is pursuing legal action against the government on behalf of at least two experts, said: “This is likely to have impacted large numbers of individuals, many of whom won’t know civil servants hold secret files on them. Such practices are extremely dangerous.” Gregory maintains that these hidden checks are unlawful, running contrary to data protection laws and potentially breaching equality and human rights legislation. Dan Kaszeta, a chemical weapons expert, was disinvited in April from giving a keynote speech at a UK defence conference after officials found social media posts criticising Tory ministers and government immigration policy. He told the Observer this weekend that he knows of 12 others who have uncovered evidence of similar government blacklisting, most of whom are frightened of speaking out. But he said far more will be unaware they ever failed secret vetting. He said: “The full extent of this is shocking and probably not fully known. I was lucky enough to be given clearcut, obvious evidence. It’s truly awful.” Kaszeta hired Leigh Day to take the government to judicial review, prompting the disclosure of evidence on its surveillance policies, and finally a confirmation in August that 15 departments had withdrawn these guidelines pending a Cabinet Office review. He received a public apology in July. “I don’t have a duty of impartiality. Nor should I,” Kaszeta added. “Trying to extend the civil service code to me because I was merely going to talk to an audience with a handful of civil servants is utterly wrong. I’m not a revolutionary Trotskyite.” The Observer has seen details of the monitoring guidelines used in several government departments. Defra, DCMS and the Department for Business and Trade all stated that as well as searching social media, officials should do a background check on Google, and useful search terms would include “criticism of government or prime minister”. DCMS recommended viewing “a minimum of five to 10 pages of results” covering a period of three to five years. It explicitly told officials to keep a file on the individual, saying: “Make sure you record this information for future reference.” DfE had specific guidance for vetting speakers at its stronger practice hubs – a network for nursery staff across England. This states that if someone has criticised the DfE or its early years policies, “engaging this person to speak … is unlikely to be appropriate”. If a person has commented favourably on someone else’s negative post they are also “inappropriate to speak”. The DfE’s departmental guidance, seen by the Observer, recommended a Google search on proposed external speakers going back five years as well as social media checks. But in response to an FoI request from the campaign group Privacy International last year, the DfE said three times that it “does not conduct monitoring, investigations or intelligence gathering on members of the public”. Caroline Wilson Palow, legal director at Privacy International, which has been investigating social media monitoring by the government for many months, said: “If the government is blacklisting people for using their right to free expression in a very valid way then that is very dangerous.” She added: “Making a concerted effort to search for negative information in this way is directed surveillance.” Lib Dem peer Lord Wallace of Saltaire, who convened a debate in the Lords on government social media vetting after Kaszeta’s blacklisting, said: “It is a horrifying notion that only people who agree with you should be involved in policy discussions.” He added that vetting experts was “the opposite of diversity and inclusion” and a “huge waste of civil servants’ time”. Jonathan Wolff, the Alfred Landecker professor of values and public policy at the University of Oxford, said: “It’s a sign of weakness to refuse to engage with challenge. And it’s an even greater display of fragility, or petulance, or both, to refuse to listen to people on one issue because they’ve criticised you on another.” Smita Jamdar, partner at law firm Shakespeare Martineau who has been advising universities on how not to fall foul of the government’s new higher education “free speech tsar”, said: “The double standards here are astonishing.” A spokesperson for the Cabinet Office said: “As the public would expect, civil service events must reflect the civil service’s impartiality.” He added: “The government is committed to protecting free speech. We are reviewing the guidance and have temporarily withdrawn it to prevent any misinterpretation of the rules.”'},\n",

       "     'bodyText': 'Three investigations have been launched after the death of a 37-year-old Albanian immigration detainee, the Home Office has said. The man, who died on Friday, had attempted to kill himself just over a week ago in Brook House immigration removal centre near Gatwick airport and was subsequently taken to East Surrey hospital, where he was cared for in the intensive care unit. On Saturday morning the Home Office confirmed the man’s death. Police, the coroner and the prisons and probation ombudsman have launched investigations. A protest was staged in Brook House, subject of a recent critical public inquiry, by mainly Albanian detainees, after the man’s attempt to kill himself and a second Albanian man’s suicide attempt. The second man was deported soon after his suicide attempt but was immediately returned to the UK after a legal challenge by his lawyer, who applied for his deportation order to be revoked. The Home Office brought him back to Brook House after agreeing to defer his removal. A psychologist’s report seen by the Guardian urged the Home Office to conduct a full clinical assessment before going ahead with the man’s deportation. “Failure to do so may result in irreparable harm to his psychological and physical wellbeing,” the report stated. One Albanian detainee involved in the protest said the two men who had tried to kill themselves had feared for their safety due to imminent plans to return them to Albania. “One of them said to me he thought it would be better to die in the UK than to be sent back to Albania. Our treatment in detention is not good. We are not animals; we are humans,” he said. The Home Office has frequently cited what it describes as its “landmark joint communique” with Albania signed on 13 December 2022 to expedite removals of Albanian nationals it says are in the UK illegally back to their home country. However, lawyers and human rights campaigners have warned that many Albanians who have claimed asylum in the UK for reasons including trafficking or blood feuds are in danger if forcibly returned to their home country. Esme Madill, a solicitor at the Migrant and Refugee Children’s Legal Unit based at Islington Law Centre, said the news about the man’s death had generated fear amongAlbanians seeking sanctuary in the UK. “This case has had real impact on the young and vulnerable Albanian victims of trafficking we work with who fear the lack of judicial oversight and believe this is what awaits them,” she said. “We are really concerned that the current designation of Albania as a safe country by the Illegal Migration Act is increasing feelings of desperation among the young people we work with and we fear incidents such as these may become more common.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “Our thoughts and condolences are with the family and friends of the person who has died. The welfare of all those in our care is of the utmost importance. Any death in immigration detention is a tragic event, and will be subject to investigation by the police, the coroner and the independent prisons and probation ombudsman.” On 26 March 2023, Frank Ospina, a 39-year-old from Colombia, died in Heathrow immigration detention centre. He is also understood to have taken his own life.'},\n",

       "     'bodyText': 'Rishi Sunak has been prime minister for slightly more than a year, but it is probably fair to say that many voters still do not have much sense of what sort of leader he is. This is, in part, because of his fondness for sometimes contradictory policy resets. But it is also something more fundamental about Sunak, a political opaqueness on to which voters – and MPs – can project their own wishes. So who is the real Sunak? We have seen quite a few versions already. The big-spending empathiser This is the incarnation many voters initially encountered, when Sunak, still only five years into his Commons career, was the face of the furlough scheme as Boris Johnson’s chancellor during Covid. As a political first impression it was not altogether bad. The scheme – officially two schemes: furlough to protect people’s jobs, and another programme to support those who were self-employed – saw Sunak give away over £70bn of public money, and was generally deemed a success. Covid also gave Sunak a chance to show his human side at Covid press conferences, where his sober if quietly reassuring bedside manner was a notable contrast to Johnson’s tendency to bombast and glibness. The citizen of nowhere A less flattering image emerged later in Sunak’s time as chancellor, when it emerged first that his wife, Akshata Murty, had non-domiciled status for UK taxes, and then that Sunak himself had held a US green card even while at the Treasury. Sunak’s wealth was not a secret – Murty is the daughter of the billionaire founder of the Indian tech company Infosys – but these details, plus reporting on the family’s £5m home in Santa Monica, left an abiding impression of someone not in touch with everyday life, and even, perhaps, not entirely committed to their UK political career. This is a version of Sunak that has lingered with the public, and has become a ubiquitous trope for his political opponents. A word cloud created by the More in Common thinktank for October’s Conservative conference, giving voters’ responses when asked what Sunak stands for, had “rich” within the three top answers, and included the word itself in a giant font. The details-obsessed technocrat Sunak’s elevation into Downing Street in October last year happened largely because of what he was not, at least in the minds of Conservative MPs. He was not a tax-cutting ideologue in the vein of Liz Truss, whose government had imploded after 45 days. Nor was he a chaotic narcissist, like Boris Johnson, who was plotting a return to No 10. The idea of Sunak being managerial, even micro-managerial, is not entirely false. When in meetings with officials, Sunak has a fondness for asking them their view on a tiny detail buried in the middle of a document, demonstrating how he has, in a very unJohnson-like way, completely absorbed the brief. This might give the impression that as prime minister, Sunak would take a distinctly pragmatic and non-ideological approach to problems. It did happen in some areas, for example his painstaking tweaks to the Northern Ireland protocol. But it was only ever part of the story. The hard-right culture warrior When Sunak toured hustings events for the summer 2022 Conservative leadership race, in which he lost to Truss, a regular part of his stump speech was a brief foray into trans rights in which he promised to stand up for “our women”. It sounded deeply awkward, and many observers simply assumed this was not the real Sunak, just what he felt was needed to win over party members. But the longer Sunak has spent in No 10 the more it seems that this was his authentic voice. At more or less every point in his premiership, given a choice between a more socially liberal or culture war-leaning stance, he has opted for the latter, on everything from trans rights to immigration, drugs or protests. Perhaps the peak was October’s Conservative conference, where a string of Sunak-appointed ministers spread conspiracy theories about 15-minute cities and Labour plans for a meat tax, while the then home secretary, Suella Braverman, gave a speech so ideological and populist that one delegate – a Tory member of the London assembly – quietly heckled her and was thrown out. The tech bro This identity is, to an extent, a close cousin to Sunak-as-technocrat, and also to his non dom-cossetted wealth, particularly given the family bolthole in California. It is also, in some ways, the element of the prime minister which is most unambiguously genuine. Sunak is very conversant with technology, regaling journalists in private with long and jargon-heavy expositions about the risks and potential benefits of artificial intelligence. He expended a lot of time and effort setting up his international AI summit at the second world war codebreaking centre of Bletchley Park. So obviously does Sunak enjoy this world that many pundits, and some MPs, predict that if ousted at the next election he will not hang around Westminster as a backbencher, but renew his green card and head off to a Nick Clegg-like lucrative career with a US tech company. The one-nation Cameroon This is a side of Sunak represented by just one decision, albeit a fairly big one: bringing David Cameron out of the post-Downing Street half life of book writing and global consulting to make him foreign secretary and a peer. Cameron is arguably quite like Sunak as prime minister in that he was much more ideological and right wing than his public image suggested. But putting him in the Foreign Office as part of a reshuffle that included the sacking of Braverman was seen as a clear message to the Tory right. Cameron’s presence might not nudge Sunak’s government further to the centre, but having him there, as well as making the generally undoctrinaire James Cleverly home secretary, does point to a No 10 less likely to try radical right-leaning moves such as quitting the European convention on human rights. But as with everything else for Sunak, it is hard to tell, and he may reinvent himself all over again.'},\n",

       "     'bodyText': 'Downing Street has ruled out a proposal by rightwing Conservatives to override international law to remove asylum seekers to Rwanda, an idea condemned by a senior centrist Tory as “dictatorial”. Damian Green, former de facto deputy PM and Conservative MP, has attacked Suella Braverman’s latest plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda as “unconservative” and “dictatorial”, as the former home secretary continues to divide her party with her outspoken interventions. Jeremy Hunt is considering slashing the UK inheritance tax rate in next week’s autumn statement after economic forecasters told the chancellor he would have more money to spend thanks to rising tax revenues and falling borrowing costs. Reports about political polling tend to focus on voting intention – how many people will vote for each party – and many of us treat these figures with some caution. That is partly because the numbers can change quickly. And partly because, even when the trend is sustained, as it is at the moment, the figures can be hard to believe. There aren’t many people at Westminster who think Labour will be 22 points ahead on polling day. That is why other polling questions can sometimes be more revealing. Today Ipsos has published some polling on attitudes to public services and, for the government, the findings are beyond abysmal. You should never say for certain that a party can’t win a general election – but it’s Friday afternoon, so here goes; if these figures are right, the election is already over. 1) Almost 80% of Britons believe public services have got worse over the past five years, and only 5% think they have got better. Given that it is hard to get 80% of people to agree on anything, this is an astonishing figure. This is much, much worse than equivalent figures during the austerity years. Another way of putting it would be to say that, for every one person who thinks public services have got better over the past five years, there are almost 16 people saying they have got worse. In 2015, for every one person saying public services were improving, there were only three people saying they were not. (The polling is based on subjective assessments, but the 78% are right; the Institute for Government recently published a report saying public service are getting a lot worse.) 2) People also continue to expect public services to get worse. The respondents weren’t told who would be in power over the next few years, and so people answering this question might not be making a party political judgement. But it suggests that 1) people are not convinced that Rishi Sunak is going to produce miraculous change in public services and; 2) when offered a choice at an election, the party that can present itself as offering change will be in a good place. 3) Most people have no faith in the government’s ability to improve the economy in the long term. Only 25% of people think government policies will improve the economy in the long term, and 68% disagree. These are the worst figures for any government on this question since Ipsos started asking it in July 1980. The only governments that have done almost as badly on this measure were John Major’s before his 1997 defeat and Gordon Brown’s before his 2010 defeat. (People aren’t always right; by the end of the Major government, the economy was doing rather well. But it’s perceptions that matter when people vote.) 4) And people have even less faith in the government’s ability to improve public services. Only 19% of people think government policies will improve the state of public services in the long term, and 75% of people think government policies will make them worse. These are the worst figures for any government on this question since Ipsos started asking it in 2001. 5) Some 50% of people think public services would improve under Labour, and 37% of people think the economy would improve. While not as good as they might be, these figures are decisively better than the equivalent ones for the government. People clearly do not think both main parties are the same. 6) Some 29% of people think they would be better off under a Labour government, against 16% who say they would be better off under a Tory one. This is a key measure, and Labour’s lead on it is substantial. David Cameron will be known as Lord Cameron of Chipping Norton, PA Media reports. PA says: The former prime minister was elevated to the House of Lords after being appointed foreign secretary by Rishi Sunak, a remarkable return to frontline politics seven years after he resigned in the wake of the Brexit referendum. It was confirmed today that his full title will be “The Rt Hon the Lord Cameron of Chipping Norton”. The title confirms Cameron’s long-held ties to the Cotswold town of Chipping Norton, which lies within his former Witney constituency. Rishi Sunak has blamed financial mismanagement by Labour for Nottingham city council being close to bankruptcy. Asked about the plight of the council, which is on course to overspend by £23m this year and has said it might have to issue a section 114 notice (in effect declaring bankruptcy), Sunak said: This year, because of the decisions the government has made, local councils across the country will have on average about 10% more cash to spend on local services than they did last year. Indeed, days after, weeks after I became prime minister, we announced billions of pounds of extra funding, particularly for social care, which is the most acute pressure that local councils face, and there are now record sums going into social care as a result of my decision. What you are seeing here is financial mismanagement. You have seen it in Birmingham city council, run by the Labour party, you are seeing it in Nottingham [city council], run by the Labour party, because of the decisions that they have made. I think local people do deserve better than that and I think it’s an example of what you get when Labour are in power. Sunak was speaking to the Nottingham Post on a visit to the Bolsover school in Chesterfield, Derbyshire. As the Nottingham Post reports, the council says the grant funding it receives from Westminster has reduced by £97m over the past decade. Jeremy Hunt is considering slashing the UK inheritance tax rate in next week’s autumn statement after economic forecasters told the chancellor he would have more money to spend thanks to rising tax revenues and falling borrowing costs, Kiran Stacey reports. Keir Starmer has implied the threat of further frontbench resignations will not affect his approach to setting Labour’s policy on the Israel-Hamas war. As Kiran Stacey, Aletha Adu and Ben Quinn report, even though 10 frontbenchers resigned or were sacked on Wednesday after voting for a ceasefire in defiance of the Labour whip, some shadow ministers who reluctantly stayed loyal are willing to quit if Starmer’s approach does not change soon. Asked today about the prospect of further resignation, replied: This isn’t a question of the management of the Labour party. When it was put to him that, as leader of the party, this should be a matter for him, he went on: I’m the leader of the Labour party. I hope that at the next election, we will be able to form a government. That is precisely why my focus is on the question of the release of the hostages and precisely on the question of how do we alleviate the suffering on the ground for so many civilians that have lost their lives in Gaza. That is what you would expect from the leader of the opposition. That is what you would expect from someone who wants to form the next government, working with our international allies to ensure that we can get those hostages released, we can alleviate the situation on the ground, the killing of so many innocent civilians — women and children included. That is where my focus is. That is where I think anybody watching this would expect the focus to be of the leader of the opposition, not on questions of party management. Keir Starmer has dismissed the new legislation promised by Rishi Sunak on Rwanda as a “gimmick” and said instead the government should focus on breaking up people-smuggling gangs. Speaking on a visit to Aberdeenshire, Starmer said: What we’ve seen from the government is almost two years wasting time on a gimmick that cost £140m paid to Rwanda, not a single person has gone, [which] has now been declared unanimously unlawful. In response to that what we do not need is another gimmick from the government to waste more time and more taxpayers’ money. We need a serious solution to a very serious problem because the small boats problem is a very serious problem. I think that that involves smashing the criminal gangs that are running the vile trade, getting people across the Channel, working with our international partners on smashing those characters. I’ve done this before when I was chief prosecutor in relation to gangs that are running drugs or people smuggling, [it] can be done. Here is Labour’s summary of its plan from earlier this week. Downing Street has not ruled out asking MPs to spend some of what is meant to be their Christmas break dealing with the PM’s “emergency legislation” on Rwanda. This is one proposal made by Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, in her Telegraph article this morning. (See 10.01am.) Braverman’s main demand is a much stronger bill, enabling the government to ignore the European convention on human rights and other laws that might hold up deportations. No 10 does not accept that “notwithstanding” clauses of this kind are needed, and this morning Rishi Sunak, talking about his bill, said: “This is not about overruling laws.” But, at the morning lobby briefing, when asked about getting MPs to legislate over Christmas, No 10 did not rule out the idea. A spokesperson said: I think we are prepared to do whatever is necessary to ensure that we can get this in place and get flights off the ground. I wouldn’t speculate on parliamentary process but I cannot impress [enough] the importance that the prime minister places on this necessary legislation to deliver for the public on the important priority of stopping the boats. The spokesperson also said the bill would be published “in the coming days”, but she would not confirm reports it is coming on Monday. MPs are due to have a break from the Commons lasting almost three weeks over Christmas, with the recess due to start on Tuesday 19 December and ending on Monday 8 January. And here are some more quotes from Rishi Sunak’s pooled TV clip this morning. Sunak suggested he would blame Labour if the Lords refuses to pass his “emergency legislation” on Rwanda (see 11.40am) quickly. Asked if he would call an early election if the Lords block the law, he replied: It doesn’t have to take a long time to get legislation through – and that is a question for the Labour party. We’re determined to get this through as quickly as possible. So the real question is: is the Labour party going to stand in the way and stop this from happening, or are they going to work with us and support this bill so we can get it through as quickly as possible? I know that the British people want this problem gripped. I know the British people will want this new law to pass so we can get flights off to Rwanda. So really, the question is for Keir Starmer and the Labour party, why don’t they? Sunak declined to say whether favoured holding an early election on the issue of Rwanda deportations if his bill got held up. Earlier today Sir Simon Clarke suggested this. (See 10.56am.) But, for obvious reasons, the prospect might not appeal. Sunak claimed he was making “real progress” on stopping small boats. He said: I think people just want the problem fixed. That’s what I’m here to do, and this year, we’ve already got the numbers down by a third. That’s because I’ve got new deals with the French, a new deal with Albania. We’re working with Turkey and Bulgaria, multiple other countries. We’re tackling the criminal gangs, we’re cutting through the backlog. We’re getting people out of hotels, saving taxpayers money, and as I said, numbers down by a third shows real progress. According to Migration Watch UK which campaigns for lower migration and which has a Channel tracker, small boat arrivals were 35% lower in 2023 up to Wednesday than they were for the equivalent period in 2022. Sunak said he would “take on” people trying to stop Rwanda flights taking over, whether it was Labour or the House of Lords. He said: We can pass these laws in parliament that will give us the powers and the tools we need. Then we can get the flights off and whether it’s the House of Lords or the Labour party standing in our way I will take them on because I want to get this thing done and I want to stop the boats. He said his patience was “wearing thin” with this issue. He said: People are sick of this merry-go-round. I want to end it – my patience is wearing thin like everyone else’s. Rishi Sunak has rejected the claim from Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, that he does not have a proper plan in response to the supreme court judgment to enable deportation flights to Rwanda to go ahead. (See 10.01am.) In a pooled clip for broadcasters, asked if she was right to say he was just “tinkering with plan A” without a serious alternative, he replied: No … The progress we’ve made this year on tackling this issue is meaningful. The number of crossings are down by a third this year, because we’re cooperating with … other countries to crack down on the criminal gangs. We’ve got to get the Rwanda plan up and running. I will do whatever it takes to make that happen. People are sick of this merry-go-round. I want to end it – my patience is wearing thin, like everyone else’s. That’s why our emergency legislation would make it crystal clear that Rwanda is safe for these purposes. It meets all the concerns that people have raised because of our new arrangement with them. A reader asks: Could you please give some commentary on the term ‘emergency legislation’? Is this a defined parliamentary or legal term? MPs often talk about “emergency bills”, or “emergency legislation”, but it is a general term, not one (like, say, a money bill) with a technical meaning with procedural consequences. Ministers use it to refer to legislation being sped through parliament. Normally a bill takes many months to go through parliament. But it can happen very quickly, if all stages of a bill get compressed into a single day in the Commons and then in the House of Lords, and this normally happens a few times in a parliament, sometimes in response to a law and order crisis, and sometimes just because there is a hole in legislation that needs plugging urgently. (On 1 September 1939, two days before the start of the second world war, parliament passed 18 emergency and war provision bills within a few hours.) In the Commons, the government is in charge of the timetable and it can push a bill through in a day regardless of what the opposition thinks. But it can’t do this in the Lords, where there is no mechanism for guillotining debates, and bills only get fast-tracked there when there is a consensus in favour. In a genuine emergency, the main parties cooperate, and bills do whizz through the House of Lords. But the chances of this happening with Rishi Sunak’s new Rwanda legislation are very slim, given the constitutional implications, and it seems very likely that the “emergency legislation” he promised on Wednesday will end up looking like a normal piece of legislation and that it will spend days or weeks being debated by peers. The government has not published the “emergency legislation” on Rwanda promised by Rishi Sunak, but the PM spoke on Wednesday about what he wanted it to achieve. Sir Jonathan Jones, who was head of the government’s legal department until he resigned over an attempt by Boris Johnson’s government to ignore international law (Suella Braverman was attorney general at the time), has written a good briefing for the Institute for Government on what Sunak is trying to do, and whether it will work. Jones is a bit more positive about what a law saying Rwanda is safe might achieve than Lord Sumption, the former supreme court judge who rubbished the idea earlier this week, but he is still sceptical. Here is an extract. The idea of declaring Rwanda to be safe is a startling one. It would amount to parliament making an assessment of fact (about arrangements in Rwanda) which is directly contrary to the recent findings of the supreme court. Would it work though? I think it might, as a matter of domestic law. Ultimately, one would expect the (UK) courts to give effect to such primary legislation, if dra…"

      "politics\/2023\/aug\/13\/brexit-brain-science-psychology-divided-uk-debate One of the most significant political events of the past few months, it has seemed to me, wasn’t strictly a bit of politics at all, but an emotional catch and quaver in the voice of a politician. The politician was the Conservative MP Steve Baker and the sudden sob in his throat came about during a TV interview about the efforts to resolve the Northern Ireland protocol. Baker, you will recall, was one of the most strident voices in the Brexit argument, a leader of the Tory European Research group, the ERG, which frustrated Theresa May’s efforts to find a compromise deal with the EU. The sob in his voice and the tears in his eyes prefaced a short, heartfelt confession about the extreme private stress that those Brexit machinations – and subsequent arguments over Covid lockdown – had caused him. Speaking subsequently to the Times, Baker expanded on that state of mind. “I felt absolutely worthless,” he said. “I felt repugnant, hateful, to blame for all of the troubles that we had, absolutely without any joy, constantly worried about everything to the point of mental torment. A constant state of panic attacks and anxiety. It’s not a state anyone should live in.” Matters came to a head in November 2021 at a weekly prayer group that Baker, a Christian, attended in Westminster. “I suddenly just started crying,” he recalled. “I couldn’t control it. I couldn’t speak. I was just clutching myself, sobbing my heart out.” One of the reasons that he was opening up about that now, he said, was that “I’m very conscious there’s lots of people out there who blame me for their misery. But it’s an unfortunate thing on this question of leave and remain that leaving has caused a great deal of anxiety and anger and depression for a lot of people. But being in the EU has caused a lot of anxiety and anger and depression for people…” Baker’s courageous candour was significant in our national conversation, it seemed to me, for a couple of reasons. For one thing, that outpouring was, to my knowledge, the only public occasion on which a leading Brexiter had owned up to the pain of doubt and anguish that the referendum had occasioned. It was, also, a very telling illustration of a truism about the whole ongoing cataclysm: that, though the vote obviously had fundamental real-world consequences for our economy and our politics, it was arguably best understood as a psychological rather a political moment. From the outset, headline writers recognised and amplified the internalised crises behind the politics in references to “Brexhaustion”, “Strexit”, “Branxiety” and “Brexistential crisis”. The referendum result, then and now, was (for remainers) an act of visceral “self-harm”. In the days after the result, the Guardian reported that “therapists everywhere” were experiencing “shockingly elevated levels of anxiety and despair”, with mental health referrals “[starting] to mushroom”. There was a clear spike in the prescription of antidepressants. By January 2019, a YouGov survey found that two-thirds of British adults were either “fairly unhappy” or “very unhappy” because of Brexit; one-third of leave voters were in that latter category. Seven years is sometimes thought of as a moment of settled change. It is understood, not quite exactly, as the period of time in which nearly all the cells in our bodies have been replaced. The Brexit-made divisions of 2016 persist, however. Though there is some anecdotal and polling evidence that there has been a shift in sentiment, and that remain might now prevail, the same polls show very little appetite to reopen the question. When the BBC did an anniversary Question Time in June, only one half of the divided nation was even allowed in the studio – the audience was made up entirely of those who voted leave, presumably to ensure the debate would not simply descend into an all-too familiar slanging match. (It was as if the marriage guidance counsellor had been forced to separate the warring parties outside.) If there is one certainty about the coming political conference season it is that considered arguments for and against Brexit will not be aired. The Tories will crow about Brexit being done. The Labour frontbench will solemnly observe that past tense, and avoid the B-word, as if it is a triggering trauma for the party and the country, best left undisturbed. If the language of psychology and identity was always the lexicon with which we understood Brexit, the denialism of our current politics insists that it remains so. With this in mind, in the course of the past week, I have been speaking to some of the behavioural psychologists who initially examined some of the choices of the referendum, to see if they now saw any way out of current entrenched divisions. (One of the triggers for this inquiry in my own mind was reading a new book called The Art of the Impossible, the inside story of Nigel Farage’s short-lived Brexit party. Revisiting the ingrained anxieties of that period was a version of the addictive chest-tightening outrage that comes from a daily scroll through the culture war of my Twitter feed.) One of the key mechanisms that all psychologists agree has defined the binary choice of the referendum is cognitive dissonance. That is the powerful internal mechanism in each of us that demands consistency in our understanding of the world, and which desperately looks for ways to correct or manage information that contradicts understanding. The term was coined by a young behaviouralist in the 1950s, Leon Festinger, who came to it after studying a religious doomsday cult that saw its date for apocalypse come and go. Cognitive dissonance described the jarring pain of cultists seeing prophecy unfulfilled and the immediate strategies to explain it away. “A man with a conviction is a hard man to change,” Festinger wrote. “Tell him you disagree and he turns away. Show him facts or figures and he questions your sources. Appeal to logic and he fails to see your point. But suppose he is presented with evidence, unequivocal and undeniable evidence, that his belief is wrong: what will happen? The individual will frequently emerge, not only unshaken, but even more convinced of the truth of his beliefs than ever before. Indeed, he may even show a new fervour about convincing and converting other people to his view.” Welcome to Brexit. The American social psychologist Carol Tavris has spent her academic career partly developing Festinger’s work. That wisdom is distilled in her book (co-written with Elliot Aronson) called, perfectly, Mistakes Were Made (But Not By Me). At the time of the Brexit referendum seven years ago, Tavris noted that “once we have made a decision, our mental doors tend to close… it is always easier to continue to justify a belief than to change it.” As a result, she suggested, Britain – like America under Trump – tribally divided, faced with all sorts of evidence that campaign promises were utter falsehoods, was “awash in dissonance”. Little of that, Tavris suggested to me last week, has gone away. “Most of us tend to hold the belief that we are essentially good and moral and competent,” she says. “And if I fear I did something bad, foolish or wrong, that fear challenges that belief we hold about ourselves. Then I have a choice: either I can accept this new information and say, ‘I guess I really screwed up here’, or I can say, ‘Sod off with your stupid evidence’.” This latter response, she suggests, is the default. Her book uses a metaphor she calls the pyramid of choice. At the top of the pyramid, before a choice has been made, an individual is at his or her most open-minded. But as soon as you step off the top in a particular direction, efforts will already be being made to justify that decision. “By the time you’ve made five, or six or seven steps down that pyramid, renewing your commitment to that decision, rehearsing that decision, the harder it will be for anyone to go back up to the top.” She points to lots of evidence that shows that even if people – judges for example - are given a face-saving way to declare they have got something wrong, they are still unlikely to accept or declare it. So what kind of conversation helps people move past that dissonance and accept the evidence of reality (that, say, £350m won’t be given to the health service and there won’t be an easy trade deal with the US – or that Brexit is not to blame for every aspect of the cost of living crisis)? “When we argue with somebody about their beliefs,” Tavris says, “the absolute crucial thing to avoid is making them feel foolish. If you say something like, ‘How could you be so stupid?’, that will almost always make your listener become even more committed to their belief. If you say instead, ‘Well, many of my own expectations turned out not to be the case too’, that might be a place to start.” Psychologists are, of course, not immune to the biases they identify. How does she maintain doubt in her own beliefs? Well, she says, “it’s that old idea of being open-minded, but not so open that your brains fall out. You want to have ideas you live by and feel passionately about. But the goal is to hold them lightly enough so that [if the evidence changes] you can also let them go.” The more I read into the science of psychological polarisation, the more often ideas of “neuropolitics” crop up. This is the fairly new science that examines – with the help of fMRI brain scans – questions of political allegiance in the context of brain structure and activity. Perhaps the leading researcher in this area in the UK is Darren Schreiber, at Essex University, author of the Your Brain Is Built for Politics. I call to ask him if the differences between “leaver” and “remainer” responses to the world are so baked in as to be visible in brain activity? Schreiber is circumspect about the current reach of his discipline, beyond broad observations. “If you’re a conservative, or if you’re a liberal, there are consistent patterns that emerge,” he says. Different experiments in brain imaging “can classify political affiliation with about 70%-plus accuracy based on brain structure, and with brain activity at an even higher rate, 80%-plus”. In very simplified terms, the amygdala, the part of the brain that processes fear and threat, appears more sensitive to certain stimuli in republican or conservative brains. Probably more significant, Schreiber suggests, is the fact that our brains are hardwired to be excited by politics in general. “Though we all have these underlying predispositions at the genetic level, to be a little bit more conservative or a little bit more liberal, these can be altered by environmental circumstances. And by far the most important environmental circumstances, if you’re a human, is your social milieu. If you’re an ant you can tell who is ‘us’ and who is ‘them’ with a very quick sniff. If you are a human it is more complex, and we put lot of work into that.” That mental effort is subject to Hebb’s law, which holds that “neurons that fire together wire together”, that is to say, the brain itself starts to be shaped in tiny pathways by the associations it is most often exposed to, a sort of internal echo chamber. How easy is it to change that wiring? “It’s really hard,” Schreiber says. “We see tremendous stability over very long periods of time.” A choice like Brexit provides endless stimuli to feed that brain activity. “It’s coalitions within coalitions within coalitions…” Schreiber says. Nick Chater, professor of behavioural science at Warwick Business School, approaches those stubborn social networks from a different perspective. In the aftermath of the referendum, he led a discussion on Radio 4’s The Human Zoo into the psychological fallout of Brexit, the hardening of decision into identity. He laughs a little when I ask him if there is any kind of time limit on cognitive dissonance. “Behavioural psychology very rarely looks at the long term,” he says. “So I think actually, psychologists have fairly little idea how long these things tend to last.” What he finds striking about the current situation is the almost total absence of debate about the effect of the decision itself. “It’s become so divisive, that even raising the issue seems almost a provocative act. There’s a sense that we just can’t talk about this at all any more.” Does he see a strategy that would allow that to change? “One of the things might change is if one could get to a point where we can reframe the debate. Say if the EU clearly broke into a two-speed Europe where there was a central core engaging in really deep integration and an outer rim more loosely connected…” And what about the kind of language that might prompt a rethink? “The most useful language would recognise that politics is inherently uncertain,” he says. “So: ‘We thought it would be a bad idea; you thought it would be better; but nobody really knew for sure. Now we know a bit more, and perhaps it’s time to rethink…’” Does he hear much evidence of that? “Not a great deal…” * * * Perhaps the most extensive examination of the referendum in these terms came in a book called The Psychology of Brexit, written by Brian Hughes, a specialist in stress psychophysiology and a professor of psychology at the University of Galway, Ireland. “Brexit,” Hughes argued, “emerged from psychological impulses, was determined by psychological choices, is construed in terms of psychological perceptions, and will leave a lasting psychological imprint.” At the heart of the choice, Hughes suggested, were two persistent fallacies. First, the notion that people ever approach political questions with clear-headed reason. Second, the idea that your opponents have cornered the market in irrationality. “Remain did not have a monopoly on reason. This is because remainers are human beings.” Hughes’s book came out in 2019 at the height of “no deal is better than a bad deal” insanity. If he were to add to it now, he suggests, it would be as a textbook case of “polarisation theory” and the ways in which the three-word sloganeering of “Brexit means Brexit” and “get Brexit done” has been repurposed to provide the illusion of simplicity to other very complex issues – “stop the boats” etc. The primary division of Brexit has extended into “clusters of interwoven views” on the climate crisis, vaccination and immigration, feeding everything into the same blunt binary. One result of that, he suggests, is that Brexit has become a classic example of toxicity. “If there is something especially scandalous in our own lives or traumatic, we will try not to mention it. It just brings too much up. People talk about the ‘Ming vase strategy’ for Labour and Brexit [the idea that they must not smash their precious majority]. The political logic is that this event was still so painful for people that you could lose half the electorate as a result of one soundbite.” If there is a way through this, he suggests, it is to break down the myths of us and them. “Brexit was obviously never the single will of the people, but also the will of leavers and the will of remainers are very far from homogenous. Politicians need to find ways of foregrounding the diversity of views that people had and have, even if some of them might be very ugly. They need to show the illusion of simple polarisation.” Preventing this, he says, is the fact that Brexit has brought into the political mainstream “all the reasoning errors that people make”. Polarity acts against nuance, and undermines the middle ground. “Both sides start to look at the other as somehow irretrievably deranged. And when you pathologise the other side, there’s no point in reaching out to them.” As a result, he suggests, “People who have the opportunity to address political challenges are no longer seeking to control the divisions in society, they are trying to maximise them for their own ends.” Does he see an end to that polarity? “It would require politicians and commentators to take some of the heat out of the arguments,” he says. “That might take a generation, or it might be one of these cyclical trends.” For the time being, our Brexity brains are it seems here to stay.\n",
      "politics\/2023\/aug\/13\/we-risk-being-seen-as-the-nasty-party-again-warn-senior-conservatives The Conservatives risk being seen once again as the “nasty party” by trying to win votes with a divisive attack on human rights, senior party figures have warned. Rishi Sunak is under increasing pressure from his party this weekend over his pledge to stop the boats crossing the Channel. It follows another week that ended in Channel deaths after the capsizing of a boat, while the total number of people making the dangerous crossing since 2018 rose above the 100,000 mark. Cabinet ministers are now said to be among those expecting the party to back quitting the European convention on human rights (ECHR) as part of its next election manifesto, should their plan to deport migrants to Rwanda be blocked in court. Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, said the government would do “whatever is necessary” to force its plans through. However, the increasingly hostile rhetoric from the right has led to growing alarm on the party’s moderate wing. Its MPs warn that any threat to leave the ECHR will put off more voters in the “blue wall” seats in the south-east, where support is already under threat. David Lidington, the former justice secretary and de facto deputy prime minister under Theresa May, said the talk risked damaging Britain’s global standing, aiding its international enemies and causing electoral damage. “In raw political terms, I think they are ignoring the risk that a lot of people who traditionally have voted Conservative would find such a move very offensive,” he said. “They will want to see a Conservative party that sticks by treaties and which is seen as on the side of human rights at a time when human rights are under attack from our genuine ideological foes around the world. “There will be a subsection of the electorate who will like this and want a hard line, however rational or irrational that policy is. But I think that they will be at least matched and probably exceeded by the number of people in seats, particularly suburban seats and home counties seats, who will be at best unimpressed and at worse seriously repelled by this kind of rhetoric and such a policy … “The risk of us being tarnished then as the nasty party again, I think, becomes very real.” Alistair Burt, the former Tory foreign minister, said: “It’s difficult to see where the advantage lies, apart from those who believe that the more often you say something, and the more disagreeable you are to others, that somehow the more successful you appear to be. I’m not sure that argument holds political water. “There have been so many good Conservative voices, including that of the prime minister and the foreign secretary, saying that this is not something they support. I think that’s the right answer and I think that they’ve looked at the risk to the brand in that way. “I think it’s a real one. It would be quite firmly attacked by opponents and by a very wide spread of society. Then it would be mercilessly attacked on whether it would actually be effective.” Tory supporters of staying inside the ECHR are taking comfort from the fact that just three months ago, Sunak endorsed the convention at a meeting of European leaders. There are also legal implications for the Good Friday agreement and the the Brexit deal with the EU. While No 10 sources said they believed their migration plans could be achieved inside the ECHR, the prime minister is expected to come under renewed pressure to back leaving the European court of human rights when MPs return to the Commons next month. John Howell, the Tory MP nominated as the UK’s candidate to become the Council of Europe’s human rights commissioner, said there had “never been a more important time to have a good grouping of human rights”. “It is a completely different thing if you’re part of the convention and then you pull out,” he said. “That sends a very bad signal to the rest of the world and it makes it very, very easy for people to compare us with [Vladimir] Putin and [Belarus’s president, Alexander] Lukashenko. In my conversations with Conservative MPs, I do not think that in this parliament, there would be a majority for that.” The news comes with other senior moderate Tories signalling they will battle to stop the party veering further to the right on culture war issues, or using green policies as a dividing line with Labour. In an interview with the Observer, Andy Street, the West Midlands mayor and the most senior Tory outside London, said he and others needed to show their brand of Conservatism would be electorally successful. “It’s my job as a moderate Conservative, who believes in inclusivity, believes in the whole notion of everyone in society succeeding together, and particularly believes in the green agenda - it’s my responsibility to stand up and demonstrate that our way of doing it can win through for the party,” he said. “I am convinced by the ballot results in the West Midlands that there is a real sweet spot of being pro-growth, pro-net zero. “There are lots of people in parliament who share my [view]. The lobby should not convince itself that our wing of the party is necessarily quiet. It’s actually very influential on this government.” A No 10 source said: “We’ve always said that there’s no overnight fix to this [small boat crossings] challenge. Our new stop the boats bill will play an important part in our effort to break the cycle, end exploitation by gangs and prevent further loss of life. “We’re making progress but we’re not complacent. That’s why it’s so important that we change the law to make sure people know if they come here illegally they will be swiftly detained and removed.”\n",

Home Office sources said legionella had been identified on the Bibby Stockholm, the 222-bedroom hulk hired by the Home Office as part of a £1.6bn immigration deal. Treasury minister John Glen has said he does not back the UK leaving the European convention on human rights. He made the comments when asked on LBC’s Nick Ferrari if he is in support of “what we understand to be a growing sentiment within the Conservative party that the United Kingdom should quit the European convention on human rights”. The Home Office is preparing for a large number of small boat arrivals over the next few days and has issued an appeal for contractor staff from across the country to work at Manston processing centre in Kent even if they are not rostered to work, the Guardian understands. Government sources have confirmed a high number of crossings are likely in the next few days. Weather conditions on Friday night are thought to be particularly favourable. Mark Drakeford, the first minister of Wales, has said he could stand for election to a directly elected senate at Westminster if Labour follows through on its pledge to abolish the House of Lords. Drakeford, the Welsh Labour leader, has previously refused invitations to stand as an MP and instead devoted himself to the Senedd in Cardiff, overseeing the implementation of new powers for the devolved parliament. The MP Angus MacNeil has announced he has been expelled from the Scottish National party (SNP). He was suspended from the party’s Westminster group last month after reportedly clashing with its chief whip, Brendan O’Hara. Junior doctors in England have launched a fifth round of industrial action, with thousands going on strike just days after starting their first NHS jobs. Soon after the doctors began their strike action the chief secretary to the Treasury, John Glen, ruled out pay negotiations with the doctors. Steve Barclay has urged the British Medical Association to end strike action and for junior doctors to accept the latest pay deal offered. The health secretary told broadcasters that he was concerned about the impact strikes are having on patients and “that is why I call on the BMA to end their industrial action”. Humza Yousaf was branded a “pestilence on the land” by a heckler as he appeared at an Edinburgh festival fringe event.

Thanks so much for joining us and for all your comments and emails. Our liveblog on Donald Trump’s legal woes is here: The Home Office is preparing for a large number of small boat arrivals over the next few days and has issued an appeal for contractor staff from across the country to work at Manston processing centre in Kent even if they are not rostered to work, the Guardian understands. Government sources have confirmed a high number of crossings are likely in the next few days. Weather conditions on Friday night are thought to be particularly favourable. The Home Office said it did not comment on operational matters. The government confirmed there was a very large number of crossings on Thursday with 755 people arriving in 14 boats, pushing the number of people who have crossed since records began in 2018, over the symbolic 100,000 mark. Thursday’s arrivals included one boat that got into difficulty with 17 people overboard off the Kent coast. They were rescued by four RNLI lifeboats. There were no crossings detected over the previous four days. According to charity workers in the camps in northern France, where people wait for the smugglers to approve their journey across the Channel, there are “a lot of people on the move” and about 800 people counted in Grande-Synthe camp, Dunkirk, waiting to cross. The high number of crossings is expected despite the prime minister and home secretary’s repeated pledges to “stop the boats” and Rishi Sunak’s assurances that the policy of increased patrols by the French had significantly increased interceptions of those trying to cross. However, after these interceptions people can simply attempt to cross again the following night. Read the full story here: Humza Yousaf was branded a “pestilence on the land” by a heckler as he appeared at an Edinburgh festival fringe event. The Scottish first minister was interrupted three times when he took to the stage with broadcaster Iain Dale on Friday, PA News reports. As he spoke about how he had experienced “too many people who have been racist” Yousaf was interrupted by Niall Fraser, a member of the Scottish Family party. Fraser shouted at Yousaf: On behalf of Scotland, fuck you. You are a pestilence on the land. You are despicable, you should be behind bars. As the man was led out of the room, Yousaf quipped: “I don’t mind a good heckle, frankly, because it saves my dad from doing it.” However, he told the audience at the All Talk show: I’ve had too many people who have been racist to me throughout my life. As a person of colour, there is a real sense of frustration at the amount of times people of colour in any profession get told, essentially, ‘you don’t belong here’. They’re told that in different ways: ‘you’re not intelligent enough’, ‘you’re not good enough’ ‘you’re out of your depth’, this that and the other. He said he had spoken about this with London mayor Sadiq Khan, as well as former SNP MP Tasmina Ahmed-Sheik, who is now a member of the rival pro-independence Alba party. We all get told the same thing,” Yousaf said. He continued: “Every interaction I have I am conscious about my colour.” He continued: I can be the first minister of this country but I am afraid there are some people who will always look at me first as a person of colour, and they will form a judgment. So when you ask me if it’s something that is on my mind, I can’t not be conscious of my colour, because everybody else is conscious of my colour. While he insisted his race “does not dominate everything I do”, the first minister went on to say it would be “a shame if I didn’t use my position to make sure that I do as much as I can for any marginalised group, not just people of colour”. Later, he was interrupted by environmental protesters, who called on him to speak out against new oil and gas licences being granted by the UK government in the North Sea. Yousaf told them: I don’t think Scotland’s future is in oil and gas. Rishi Sunak last month travelled to Scotland to announce government support for future oil and gas licensing rounds, with the prime minister saying he wanted to “max out” developments in the North Sea. Responding to the news that people being housed onboard the controversial barge Bibby Stockholm are being removed because of potentially deadly bacteria in the water system, a Dorset council spokesperson said: Dorset council’s environmental health team and Public Health Dorset are advising the Home Office and its contractors, alongside the UK Health Security Agency and NHS Dorset, following notification of positive samples of legionella bacteria in the water system on the Bibby Stockholm barge. No individuals have presented symptoms of legionnaires’ disease, and there is no health risk to the wider community of Portland. It is understood the Home Office is managing the search for alternative accommodation for the asylum seekers. The government must stop putting refugees into “unsafe and undignified accommodation”, the director of survivor empowerment at charity Freedom from Torture said. Kolbassia Haoussou said: The presence of life-threatening bacteria onboard the Bibby Stockholm is just another shocking revelation that we’ve seen unfold over the past few weeks. This government’s punitive policies and deliberate neglect of the asylum system is not just cruel, it’s dangerous. This government urgently needs to stop forcing refugees into unsafe and undignified accommodation, and instead focus their efforts on rebuilding a compassionate and efficient system that protects people like me who have fled torture and persecution. All asylum seekers being housed onboard a controversial barge are being removed because of potentially deadly bacteria in the water system, it has been confirmed. Home Office sources said legionella had been identified on the Bibby Stockholm, the 222-bedroom hulk hired by the Home Office as part of a £1.6bn immigration deal. The first asylum seekers boarded on Monday, and by Friday there were 39 onboard the vessel, which is docked in Portland Port, Devon. People can get lung infections, such as legionnaires’ disease or Pontiac fever, if they breathe in small droplets of water in the air that contain the bacteria. No one has so far been identified as contracting the disease. A Home Office spokesperson said environmental samples from the water system on the Bibby Stockholm had shown levels of legionella bacteria that required further investigation. Read more from my colleagues Rajeev Syal and Diane Taylor here: The charity Care4Calais said ministers “should now realise” that keeping refugees on barges was “untenable” after asylum seekers were removed from the Bibby Stockholm following the discovery of levels of legionella bacteria in the water system onboard. Steve Smith, the chief executive of Care4Calais, said: We have always known our concerns over the health and safety of the barge are justified, and this latest mismanagement proves our point. The Bibby Stockholm is a visual illustration of this government’s hostile environment against refugees, but it has also fast become a symbol for the shambolic incompetence which has broken Britain’s asylum system. The government should now realise warehousing refugees in this manner is completely untenable, and should focus on the real job at hand – processing the asylum claims swiftly, so refugees may become contributing members of our communities as they so strongly wish. The asylum seekers who arrived on the Bibby Stockholm barge this week are being removed after legionella bacteria was found in the water, the Home Office said. A spokesperson said 39 asylum seekers who moved on to the barge earlier in the week are being disembarked. The first group of asylum seekers were seen arriving at Portland on Monday morning in buses and were taken onboard. The barge was docked off the Dorset coast more than three weeks ago and remained empty until Monday due to health and safety concerns. The spokesperson said: The health and welfare of individuals on the vessel is our utmost priority. Environmental samples from the water system on the Bibby Stockholm have shown levels of legionella bacteria which require further investigation. Following these results, the Home Office has been working closely with UKHSA and following its advice in line with long-established public health processes, and ensuring all protocol from Dorset council’s environmental health team and Dorset NHS is adhered to. As a precautionary measure, all 39 asylum seekers who arrived on the vessel this week are being disembarked while further assessments are undertaken. No individuals onboard have presented with symptoms of Legionnaires’, and asylum seekers are being provided with appropriate advice and support. The samples taken relate only to the water system on the vessel itself and therefore carry no direct risk indication for the wider community of Portland nor do they relate to fresh water entering the vessel. Legionnaires’ disease does not spread from person to person. The UK economy grew faster than expected in the second quarter of this year after growth was boosted by a recovery in car manufacturing and a surprisingly strong June. UK GDP increased by 0.2% in April to June, up from 0.1% in the previous three months and the best quarterly reading in more than a year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The data surprised economists, with a poll of them beforehand forecasting no growth in output during the quarter. The reading was helped by an unexpectedly strong performance in June, when output rose by 0.5%. GDP had fallen by 0.1% in May because of an extra bank holiday to celebrate the coronation of King Charles after growth of 0.2% in April. However, the UK economy still remains 0.2% smaller than it was in the final quarter of 2019, before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic triggered the deepest recession on record. The cost of living crisis period of the last 18 months remains the weakest period outside a recession for 65 years, the Resolution Foundation thinktank pointed out, despite the UK economy dodging a technical recession of two consecutive quarters of declining GDP. Darren Morgan, an ONS director of economic statistics, said: The economy bounced back from the effects of May’s extra bank holiday to record strong growth in June. Manufacturing saw a particularly strong month, with both cars and the often-erratic pharmaceutical industry seeing particularly buoyant growth. Services also had a strong month, with publishing and car sales and legal services all doing well, though this was partially offset by falls in health, which was hit by further strike action. Construction also grew strongly, as did pubs and restaurants, with both aided by the hot weather. The increase in output in the latest quarter was mainly driven by an increase of 1.6% in manufacturing, the ONS said. It said falling prices of materials may be “relieving some pressure on manufacturers”. You can follow our business liveblog here for more on this story: Steve Barclay has urged the British Medical Association to end strike action and for junior doctors to accept the latest pay deal offered. The health secretary told broadcasters that he was concerned about the impact strikes are having on patients and “that is why I call on the BMA to end their industrial action”. He said: Junior doctors will receive up to 10.3%, an average of 8.8%, in terms of their pay deal. We have accepted in full the recommendations of the independent pay review body, but we are also investing more widely. The first-ever workforce long-term plan, to expand workforce training, the biggest-ever investment in the NHS estate, over £20 billion of work, investing record sums in the NHS. We have accepted in full the recommendations of the independent pay review body process, and it is also right that we balance that with our wider commitment to bring inflation down, because that matters to NHS staff just as it does to the community. Barclay added: Of course I stand ready to have discussions with junior doctors in terms of other issues around their working conditions, but in terms of pay we have made a fair and final offer, we have accepted in full the recommendations of the independent pay review body process. That is why the BMA should now call off their strikes. The Scottish Liberal Democrats have announced their candidate in the forthcoming Rutherglen and Hamilton West byelection. Gloria Adebo, who works as a data analyst, will run for the party in the vote triggered by the successful recall petition for Margaret Ferrier. While a date for the byelection has not been set yet, it will be keenly contested by the SNP and Labour. Adebo, who lives in Rutherglen with her family and previously stood as a council candidate, started her campaign by calling for more help for people struggling to pay their mortgages. She said: The Rutherglen and Hamilton West byelection is a real chance for local people to deliver a judgment on the difficulties and disasters we have been landed in by incompetent, populist governments in London and Edinburgh. It needn’t be like this. And it is the Liberal Democrats who, increasingly, are a growing and dynamic part of an alternative way forward - offering hope in place of despair, founded on a belief in individuals, in the rule of law, in equality of opportunity and the importance of human rights here and across the world. Other candidates in the byelection include Labour’s Michael Shanks, the SNP’s Katy Loudon and the Conservatives’ Thomas Kerr. China has temporarily shelved plans to build a new embassy in London, angrily accusing the British government of not doing enough to force through planning permission for the project. China had been given until Thursday to file an appeal to Tower Hamlets council in east London after the proposals for the embassy were rejected. Beijing bought the Royal Mint Court site for its new embassy in 2018 for £255m, with the plan to move from its long-term but relatively cramped site in Portland Place, near Regent’s Park. Chinese officials appear to have decided that rather than appeal through the local Tower Hamlets planning process, where they have relatively little chance of success, they want central government to intervene and give assurances that it will back a resubmitted application. The UK Foreign Office is aware that if it does not intervene, its already strained relations with Beijing will be damaged further. The Chinese foreign ministry in a statement urged the British government to meet its “international obligation” to help it build a new embassy, and said China wanted to find a solution “on the basis of reciprocity and mutual benefit”. China wants to build a 65,000 sq metre (700,000 sq ft) embassy, which would be its biggest mission in Europe and almost twice the size of its embassy in Washington. A decision to build such a large embassy would be proof that China regarded relations with the UK as critical since Brexit. Read more here: On Thursday 755 people were detected crossing the Channel in small boats, the highest number on a single day so far this year, the Home Office said. The previous high for this year was 686 people on 7 July. The cumulative number of arrivals by small boats in 2023 now stands at a provisional total of 15,826. Total arrivals last year were 45,755. The latest figures mean there have been 100,715 arrivals detected since January 2018, when data was first reported. There were 14 boats detected crossing the Channel on Thursday, which suggests an average of about 54 people per boat. Junior doctors in England have launched a fifth round of industrial action, with thousands going on strike just days after starting their first NHS jobs. The latest strikes from British Medical Association (BMA) junior doctors began at 7am on Friday and will end at 7am next Tuesday. It could result in the total number of appointments cancelled due to NHS industrial action hitting 1m. Foundation year 1 doctors started their first roles after medical school nine days ago, on 2 August, and will now strike for four days amid the bitter dispute with the government over pay. Dr Raymond Effah, one of those striking first-year doctors who has just begun his first placement, said: When I chose medicine as my career, never did I imagine my second week in the job would see me going on strike. The government may not see the value of myself and my doctor colleagues, but we do, leaving us no choice but to strike. As a medical student I have now gone through a pandemic, a cost of living crisis, and now have student debts of almost £100,000. Even with the 10% pay uplift, I’m still starting in a job where real-terms pay has eroded by more than a quarter. That is why first-year doctors are going on strike today even though we have barely begun. It is for our future in this profession. Soon after the doctors began their strike action the chief secretary to the Treasury, John Glen, ruled out pay negotiations with the doctors. He told Sky News: A 35% pay increase, which is what they’re asking for, is completely unrealistic. It would be sending completely the wrong signal to the economy and to the wider public at a time when obviously inflationary pressures are the top priority of the government. He added: We will continue to be open to them to talk about working conditions, but what we can’t move on is additional pay, given that we’ve listened to their independent pay review body ... we urge the doctors to stop the strikes and start serving the patient. Read the full story here: Rob Blackie has been selected as the Liberal Democrat candidate in next year’s London mayoral contest. The party confirmed the Pimlico native and former director of research for Charles Kennedy will run in an attempt to defeat Sadiq Khan. Blackie said: It is an absolute honour to have been selected as the Liberal Democrat candidate for London mayor. London needs a liberal challenger to the mayor – who has been a disappointment to many Londoners. Khan has failed to tackle rape, sexual offences and other serious crimes over the last seven years and Labour are committed to the worst possible priorities for the police – arresting people for laughing gas rather than spending time on serious crimes. The Conservatives are discredited nationally by their cost of living failures and in London they’ve all but given up. For far too long people in London have been let down by Labour and the Conservative plan for London shows that they are not serious about tackling our city’s problems. The MP Angus MacNeil has announced he has been expelled from the Scottish National party (SNP). He was suspended from the party’s Westminster group last month after reportedly clashing with its chief whip, Brendan O’Hara. The party’s conduct committee met on Thursday to discuss his case after he refused to immediately rejoin the group at the end of his suspension. MacNeil, 53, has represented the Na h-Eileanan an Iar, or Western Isles constituency since 2005. He tweeted about his expulsion, using a kangaroo emoji to refer to the member conduct committee. He said: The Summer of Member Expulsion, has indeed come to pass. As I have been expelled as a rank &amp; file SNP member by a ‘member conduct committee’. I didn’t leave the SNP - the SNP have left me. I wish they were as bothered about independence as they are about me! He was suspended from the Westminster group for a week in early July following reports of a row with O’Hara in the House of Commons. Later that month his membership of the party was suspended later the same month because he refused to immediately rejoin the SNP group. He released a statement attacking the SNP leadership’s approach to independence, accusing it of a lack of urgency. Read the full story here: Rishi Sunak said the government’s plan was working, after the latest GDP figures showed the UK economy had grown by 0.2% in the second quarter of the year. The prime minister said: This is good news. At the beginning of the year I made growing the economy one of my top priorities, and we are making progress. There’s still more work to do, but today’s figures show the plan is working. A government minister has defended a Tory MP who failed to declare she held shares valued at more than £70,000 in Shell while she was environment secretary. Theresa Villiers admitted her shareholding in the oil and gas company via her latest update to the register of members’ financial interests. Under the section “other shareholdings on, valued at more than £70,000”, Villiers’ entry says: “From 23 February 2018, Shell plc; energy. (Registered 17 July 2023).” Asked about the omission on Sky News, Treasury minister John Glen described it as an “oversight on her part” and insisted the former minister had been “very clear” in apologising. Villiers served in Boris Johnson’s cabinet as environment secretary from July 2019 until February 2020. MPs are required to register any change to their registrable interests within 28 days. A list of ministers’ interests from November 2019 did not include a mention of the shares for Villiers. The MP for Chipping Barnet’s latest entry also included newly declared shares above the same threshold in drinks manufacturer Diageo from February 23 2018 and Experian plc from July 29 2019. Glen said: I think she’s apologised. She’s admitted their mistake. I think part of the situation is there’s an MP regime for disclosures of private assets and there’s a ministerial regime. As I understand it, she didn’t fulfil the obligations of the MP regime while she was a minister. But as I say she’s been very clear in apologising, it was an oversight on her part, and she will correct it and make sure it doesn’t happen again. Here’s more on that story from my colleague Henry Dyer: Mark Drakeford, the first minister of Wales, has said he could stand for election to a directly elected senate at Westminster if Labour follows through on its pledge to abolish the House of Lords. Drakeford, the Welsh Labour leader, has previously refused invitations to stand as an MP and instead devoted himself to the Senedd in Cardiff, overseeing the implementation of new powers for the devolved parliament. But Drakeford, 68, the most electorally successful of Welsh Labour leaders, confirmed on Wednesday he plans to quit as an MS at the next Senedd elections in 2026; he has said he will quit as first minister before then, to allow his successor time to bed in. Replacing the Lords with an elected senate for the UK’s nations and regions is one of Keir Starmer’s major post-election pledges, alongside a suite of new powers for the devolved governments and England’s region. The measure was central to a constitutional reform commission led by former prime minister Gordon Brown, which Drakeford has endorsed. The timetable for abolishing the Lords has slipped. Labour now favours installing a large slate of new peers in its first months of power, to act as a counterweight to the Tory majority built by recent prime ministers. Quizzed about his future by Iain Dale and Jacqui Smith on the Edinburgh fringe on Thursday, for their podcast For the Many Live, Drakeford vehemently ruled out accepting a peerage: he said the Lords was a “desperate, desperate anachronism. It’s not for me.” The Brown report “powerfully argues for a much smaller elected chamber of the regions and the nations, with a particular responsibility for the constitution”. Asked by Smith whether he would stand for the new senate, Drakeford said: I wouldn’t rule that out, put it like that. But I wouldn’t go to an unelected one. Treasury minister John Glen has said he does not back the UK leaving the European convention on human rights. He made the comments when asked on LBC’s Nick Ferrari if he is in support of “what we understand to be a growing sentiment within the Conservative party that the United Kingdom should quit the European convention on human rights”. Earlier this week, Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, said the government would do “whatever is necessary”, even if that meant pulling out of the ECHR, the 70-year-old pan-European treaty that protects human rights and political freedoms in the continent. His comments are an escalation of the government’s previous statements that leaving the ECHR was not an immediate step it was going to take. It has insisted that it can deliver on Rishi Sunak’s pledge to “stop the boats” within the convention. Glen told Ferarri he did not support leaving because he believed in the plan and said it hadn’t finished the legal process yet. He said: This is a Europe-wide problem. We’ve had a 30% increase in illegal immigration across Europe, but we’re working with Turkey, new arrangement with them last week, with France, with Albania. The arrangements with France have led to 33,000 fewer crossings – also tougher fines for employers and landlords. We’ve got the professional enablers taskforce. We’re working with media companies as well. So this is a multi-dimensional approach as well as the immigration (bill) which of course many criticised us for and it was a real battle to take through the Houses of Parliament. But we’ve got a legal challenge waiting on that, but I believe in plan A and we will see that come to fruition in the autumn. Glen said he did not want to “speculate about alternatives” to the government’s immigration policy. Asked about “small boats week” on Times Radio, he said: I think it’s important to recognise that there are many dimensions to the government’s policy. We have diplomatic arrangements with Turkey, in France, Albania. Indeed from France, we’ve seen 33,000 fewer arrivals because of that arrangement. But we’ve got to understand is this phenomena of illegal migration of criminal gangs taking people across Europe and across the Channel, we have seen a 30% increase in Europe as well over recent months. Glen went on: We’ve obviously passed legislation in the House of Commons. There is a legal challenge to that, but we are confident, and the government has been made clear by the legal system that they support the principle of offshoring our illegal immigrants to Rwanda, and we haven’t finished the conclusion of that legal process yet, but we are confident that that will work. Asked about a “plan B”, he said: Well, we believe that the actions that we’ve taken – and I’ve just taken you through a number of them – and including the legislation which hasn’t yet been fully enacted, because of the legal challenge outstanding in the autumn, will work and we stand by that. I don’t want to speculate about alternatives until we’ve exhausted the process that we think will work. I will be looking after the politics blog today.

      "politics\/live\/2023\/aug\/10\/grant-shapps-tories-net-zero-energy-security-uk-politics-live A record 7.6 million people in England were waiting for NHS treatment in June, with two in five patients waiting more than 18 weeks to be seen. The arrival of more people in the UK following a rescue in the Channel may take the official number of people recorded as coming to the UK on small boats above 100,000 since record-keeping began in 2018. (See 12.17pm.) The revelation has led Lee Anderson, the Conservative party deputy chairman, to say that if Rishi Sunak’s small boats strategy does not work, the Tories may have to take “drastic action”, such as withdrawing from the European convention on human rights. (See 1.11pm.) Court proceedings for no-fault evictions in England have reached their highest level in six years, ahead of new legislation being passed to ban the practice. A senior police officer and brother of the Conservative former home secretary Sajid Javid has been appointed to a top immigration role in the Home Office. NHS Providers, which represents hospitals and other NHS trusts, says today’s waiting list figures (see 9.44am) will ring alarm bells for health leaders. Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive at NHS Providers, said: A perfect storm of squeezed funding in the NHS, the pandemic, the cost-of-living crisis, workforce shortages and now industrial action has pushed the waiting list to its highest point at 7.57 million. This will ring alarm bells for trust leaders up and down the country as mounting care backlogs inevitably pile more pressure onto an already overstretched NHS. Amid ongoing strikes, this is an extremely busy summer for A&amp;E while ambulance services also face very high demand and more urgent calls. Cordery also said that, because of the impact strikes were having on the ability of hospitals to bring down the backlog, it was vital for government and the unions to try to resolve the pay dispute. On the subject of immigration, there is at least one category where Lee Anderson is not going to have to worry about numbers soaring. When Priti Patel was home secretary, she announced that the UK would issue “global talent” visas to people deemed to be among the brightest and the best in the world. One way of qualifying was to win one of various “global talent” prizes on a Home Office list, including ones like the Nobel prize. According to a report for Research Professional News (RPN), just three of these global prize visas have been issued. Carol Monaghan, the SNP’s education spokesperson at Westminster, said: It is embarrassing for the UK government that they cannot attract the ‘brightest and the best’. They have failed to understand that it is not simply a matter of opening the doors to global talent, but rather fostering a welcoming environment and creating an immigration system that is fair and dignified for all – not just Nobel prize winners. The prize pathway is only one route to getting a “global talent” visa. Overall, more than 2,500 global talent visas had been issued by November last year. RPN says the number of applications is going up, with more than 6,000 received in the past year. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) has said lifeboats from Dover, Ramsgate, Dungeness and Littlestone were called by HM Coastguard to an incident in the Channel this morning. This is the incident mentioned earlier in the report saying the small boat arrivals picked up today may take the total number of recorded arrivals since 2018 past 100,000 for the first time. (See 12.17pm.) The charity said in a statement: This morning all-weather RNLI lifeboats from Dover, Ramsgate and Dungeness, along with Littlestone RNLI’s inshore lifeboat, were tasked to an incident in the Channel by HM Coastguard. On arrival at the scene, some casualties were found to be in the water. All casualties are believed to be accounted for and were brought to safety by the RNLI’s volunteer crews. The British government is considering tightening rules on investment in China after the US president, Joe Biden, announced new measures aimed at limiting the dollars and expertise flowing into sensitive technologies in the country, Anna Isaac reports. Here is a request from a reader, prompted by the figure about 100,000 people arriving in the UK via small boats since 2018 being in the headline. Please could we have some context for the number of small boat arrivals v the overall immigration numbers? I think I saw a suggestion that most immigrants are on business visas, specific country schemes or students, and that boat arrivals are actually negligible in comparison. Is this so? The reader is right. The people who arrive in the UK in small boats are only a tiny proportion of the overall number of immigrants coming to the UK every year. The small boat arrivals don’t even make up a majority of the people who apply for asylum. As the Home Office says in this report: The majority of small boat arrivals claim asylum. In 2022, 90% (40,302 of 44,666 arrivals) claimed asylum or were recorded as a dependant on an asylum application. However, small boat arrivals account for less than half (45%) of the total number of people claiming asylum in the UK in 2022. There was more information about the asylum seekers who do not arrive by boat in this Times story last week. And asylum seekers as a whole – the ones who arrive by small boat, and those who arrive by other means – are still only a small fraction of the total annual immigration cohort. This report from the Migration Observatory provides a good overview. It includes this graph. The exact proportion of immigrants who are refugees varies considerably from year to year, and the figure also depends on whether you just count refugees who claim asylum, or whether you include other types of refugees admitted to the UK on humanitarian grounds (such as Ukrainians). This House of Commons library briefing, published in March, has more detail. Here is an extract. Asylum seekers made up around 6% of immigrants to the UK in 2019. In 2020, when overall immigration was lower than usual due to the pandemic, asylum seekers might have made up around 12% of immigrants. In the year ending June 2022, the latest period for which we have estimates, asylum seekers and refugees made up approximately 18% of immigrants to the UK. This includes arrivals under the Ukraine schemes, the Afghan relocation and resettlement schemes, arrivals in small boats, other resettled persons and arrivals on family reunion visas (around 190,000 individuals in total). If including the British National (Overseas) scheme in the category of humanitarian routes [the scheme for people from Hong Kong], up to 25% of immigration in that year would fall into that category. Here is a question from a reader about the NHS waiting list figures. Is the 7.6 million number of people or the number of operations? I am on the list for 4 completely separate ones only one of which I have a date for. The 7.6 million figure relates to waits, not people. Technically it refers to what the NHS calls “referral to treatment (RTT) pathways” – cases where someone is waiting for treatment (which does not necessarily involve an operation). That means that, if there are people like the reader who posed this question waiting for more than one treatment, they get counted more than once. Arguably this makes the headline figure misleading, because the number of individuals waiting for treatment will be lower than the overall total quoted in the statistics. But the NHS does not have an equivalent figure for individuals, not cases, and the headline figure is easily understood, and does represent real people. Arguably if one person is waiting for four treatments, that is just as bad as four people waiting for a single treatment each. This is what NHS England says on this point in the notes to its news release. Each pathway relates to an individual referral rather than an individual patient so if a patient was waiting for multiple treatments they may be included in the figures more than once. Where we refer to the number of ‘patients’ waiting or starting treatment, technically, we are considering the number or percentage of ‘pathways’. Yesterday Downing Street said Rishi Sunak believed he couuld stop the small boat crossings, and implement the plan to send people to Rwanda, without the UK having to leave the European convention on human rights. Asked about this in his GB News interview, Lee Anderson, the Conservative party deputy chair, indicated that he accepted the government’s position. But he said that, personally, he was in favour of withdrawal from the ECHR, and that if Sunak’s plan did not work, “drastic measures” would be needed. He said: You only have to Google my name and put ECHR in and you’ll see where I stand on the matter and I’ve spoken about it in the chamber as well. I’ve always been an advocate of leaving, but you know, we’re a team. And if things don’t work, if things don’t go to plan, then we’ve got to take drastic measures and I would fully support the government in doing that. Lee Anderson, the Conservative party deputy chairman, has said he is “very angry” about the PA Media report saying that the small boat arrivals picked up in the Channel today may take the total number of people who have come to the UK via this route above 100,000 for the first time. (See 12.17pm.) The official numbers will be out tomorrow. The Home Office data goes back to 2018, which is when small boats arrivals were first logged as a problem. The official database won’t include any people coming to the UK irregularly on small boats before then, and any migrants who arrived without being recorded. In an interview with GB News, Anderson said: I’m very angry about the number. Again, very angry, as you know, every single day when I see these illegal migrants. Anderson also repeated his claim that people arriving on small boats are not genuine asylum seekers – even though Home Office data suggests that a majority of them are. Last year 90% of people who arrived this way claimed asylum. Most of these claims have not yet been processed, but of all the claims that have been processed since 2018, 61% have been accepted. Anderson told GB News that the situation was “infuriating”, but that the Conservatives were the only party that could sort the situation out. The number of people crossing the Channel on small boats in the last five and a half years could have passed 100,000 following fresh arrivals of migrants on lifeboats on Thursday, PA Media reports. PA says: PA news agency analysis of government figures since current records began on 1 January 2018 showed that, as of Tuesday, 99,960 people had arrived in the UK after making the journey. And RNLI lifeboats were spotted bringing dozens to shore this morning, meaning it is likely the milestone has been reached. A witness said there appeared to be more than 40 people brought ashore onboard two lifeboats, which had attended a dinghy out in the Channel. Data on the number of people detected crossing the Channel in small boats to enter the UK each day is published by the Home Office and Border Force. The figures are published the day after and the latest update shows that on Wednesday zero people were detected. Since the beginning of January 2023 to 9 August, figures show 15,071 people crossed the Channel. George Eustice, the former environment secretary, was interviewed this morning on the Today programme. He was primarily there to talk about his opposition to the government’s plans on the installation of new oil boilers in off-grid homes from 2026. Instead of encouraging people to install heat pumps, it would be better for the government to get them to convert their boilers to run on renewable fuels (like hydrotreated vegetable oil made from waste cooking oil), he said. But Eustice also argued that this issue showed why the government should not be too prescriptive yet about how it will achieve net zero. He said: We remain committed to net zero but where I absolutely agree with the prime minister at the moment is we’ve got to get there in the right way. And the reason we are aiming for net zero by 2050 is to create a strong pull towards new technologies, new innovations that will help us get there. And the real problem we’ve got is groups like the Climate Change Committee, endlessly harrying the government to lock down prematurely the wrong kind of policy mix now which actually would jeopardise getting to net zero. So we’ve got to keep the space for new technology and new innovations to come forward. And the failure at the moment is everybody’s on the government’s back asking them to lock down prematurely to quite possibly the wrong technologies. Eustice said the government should achieve net zero “in a cost-effective way”. He went on: “And I think that’s why the current prime minister is right to push back against some of these things.” Bas Javid, currently deputy assistant commissioner at the Metropolitan police, has been appointed director general of immigration enforcement at the Home Office, the government has announced. Javid, who will start his new job in November, is brother to Sajid Javid, the former home secretary. The Royal College of Nursing says today’s hospital waiting list figures for England (see 9.44am) show the NHS is “falling into deeper crisis”. In a statement Nicola Ranger, the RCN’s chief nursing officer, said: With a record number of patients now on a waiting list in England, the NHS is falling into deeper crisis. A decade of underinvestment in the NHS has led to dire consequences for patients and pushed many nursing staff out of the profession they love and with unrelenting pressure on those who remain. The latest figures from NHS England show a small improvement in A&amp;E waiting times and ambulance response times, PA Media reports. Some 74% of patients in England were seen within four hours in A&amp;Es last month, up from 73.3% in June, PA says. The figure hit a record low of 65.2% in December. The NHS recovery plan sets a target of March 2024 for 76% of patients attending A&amp;E to be admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours. The number of people waiting more than 12 hours in A&amp;E departments in England from a decision to admit to actually being admitted was 23,934 in July, down 10% from 26,531 in June, PA says. The figure hit a record 54,573 in December 2022. The average response time in July for ambulances in England dealing with the most urgent incidents, defined as calls from people with life-threatening illnesses or injuries, was eight minutes and 21 seconds, NHS figures show. This is down from eight minutes and 41 seconds in June but is above the target standard response time of seven minutes, PA says. Ambulances took an average of 31 minutes and 50 seconds last month to respond to emergency calls such as heart attacks, strokes and sepsis, PA says. This is down from 36 minutes and 49 seconds in June, while the target is 18 minutes. Response times for urgent calls, such as late stages of labour, non-severe burns and diabetes, averaged one hour, 50 minutes and nine seconds in July, down from two hours, five minutes and 40 seconds in June, PA says. The Labour party is committed to setting up a publicly-owned energy company, Great British Energy, to champion green power. Today the TUC has published research claiming that, if the government were to invest in this “at the right scale” (it proposes a £40bn investment in clean technologies), this could generate £140bn for the economy. Paul Nowak, the TUC general secretary, said: Publicly-owned energy companies work. Across Europe they are lowering household bills and delivering good jobs. But the UK is feeding foreign firms’ profits and subsidising cheaper bills abroad, while British households struggle to heat their homes and pay their bills. It’s common sense – those who invest in the future end up better off. A British public energy champion – at the right scale – could create good jobs, speed up the path to net zero and make everyone better off by a mammoth £140bn. Opposition parties are claiming that the latest hospital waiting list figures from NHS England (see 9.44am) show the government is failing in this area. For Labour, Rosena Allin-Khan, the shadow mental health minister, said: One in eight people are now waiting for NHS treatment, more than ever before. Patients are waiting in pain and discomfort for months or even years. Rishi Sunak has no plan to turn this around, he only offers excuses … The last Labour government delivered the shortest waiting lists and highest patient satisfaction in history. The next Labour government will provide the staff and reform the NHS needs, so it is there for us when we need it once again. And for the Liberal Democrats, Daisy Cooper, the deputy leader and health spokesperson, said: This latest Conservative health secretary is not up to the job and owes the public an apology. He says his main focus has been bringing down the waiting list, but he is failing miserably, leaving millions in pain and discomfort … This Conservative government should hang their heads in shame. Rishi Sunak needs to bring forward a proper plan to bring down waiting times as a matter of urgency. Simon Byrne, chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, has been urged to consider his position over the mass breach of officers’ data amid warnings that terrorists could use the information to carry out attacks, Aubrey Allegretti reports. There is a mixed picture on the cancer figures in the NHS England data, according to the data reported by PA Media. Here are the main points. Referrals Some 261,006 urgent cancer referrals were made by GPs in England in June, up 6% on 245,595 in May and up 13% year-on-year from 231,868 in June 2022, PA says. The proportion of cancer patients who saw a specialist within two weeks of being referred urgently by their GP fell slightly from 80.8% in May to 80.5% in June, remaining below the target of 93%, PA says. The 93% target was last hit in May 2020, during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic. Diagnosis Some 73.5% of patients urgently referred for suspected cancer were diagnosed or had cancer ruled out within 28 days, up from 71.3% the previous month, PA says. The NHS elective recovery plan sets a goal of March 2024 for 75% of patients who have been urgently referred by their GP for suspected cancer to be diagnosed or have cancer ruled out within 28 days. Treatment A total of 59.2% of cancer patients who had their first treatment in June after an urgent GP referral had waited less than two months, up slightly from 58.7% in May, NHS England figures show, PA says. The target is 85%. The government still has not achieved its target of getting rid of hospital waits in England lasting more than 18 months, today’s NHS England figures show. Rishi Sunak wanted to eliminate 18-month waits by April. But the figures show that at the end of June 7,177 people had been waiting more than a year and a half for treatment, down from 11,446 at the end of May. Today’s NHS England figures also show that 383,083 people in England had been waiting more than 52 weeks to start routine hospital treatment at the end of June – down very slightly from 385,022 at the end of May. The government wants to eliminate all waits lasting more than 52 weeks by spring next year. The number of people in England waiting to start routine hospital treatment has risen to a new record high, PA Media reports. PA says: An estimated 7.6 million people were waiting to start treatment at the end of June, up from 7.5 million in May, NHS England said. It is the highest number since records began in August 2007. Rishi Sunak has made cutting waiting lists one of his priorities for 2023, pledging in January that “lists will fall and people will get the care they need more quickly”. Good morning. Since the Uxbridge and South Ruislip byelection, in which the Tories held the seat unexpectedly following a voter backlash against the extension of Ulez (the ultra low emission zone), which will impose extra costs on some drivers, the Conservative party has been toning down its support for green measures considerably. Rishi Sunak even resorted to posing for a photograph in Margaret Thatcher’s old Rover, and promising to “max out” the UK’s oil and gas reserves. But this morning there has been a bit of pushback from Grant Shapps, the energy secretary. In remarks that may be aimed as much at his party as the wider world, Shapps says there will be no global security without net zero. Shapps made the comment in an interview with Politico in which he said that the UK will be hosting a global summit on energy security in spring 2024. Shapps said it would discuss the the need to “diversify from fossil fuels” and he declared: We can’t have global security without net zero … There’s no global security if millions of people are having to uproot because of weather patterns. The UK, and other countries, would be more secure with alternative sources of energy, he said. “Greater diversity could actually give us much greater security,” he said. All of this sounds quite obvious. But in the Conservative party, and particularly in the Tory press (the Sunday Telegraph is calling for a referendum on net zero), these are not truths universally acknowledged, as a better writer would have put it. In his interview Shapps also implied China might be invited to the conference. He said the details had not been finalised, but he declared he wanted it to be “inclusive in nature”. If China is invited, that may go down badly with some in his party too. We are into the middle of August – normally death valley for Westminster political news – but, in so far as there are stories around, some of them relate to net zero. The TUC has published a report on the potential benefits of having a publicly owned energy company, and George Eustice, the former environment secretary, has given an interview about his call for the government to change its plan to ban the installation of new oil boilers in off-grid homes from 2026. For the third day in a row, Lee Anderson’s call for migrants to “fuck of back to France” is still being talked about. In Northern Ireland Simon Byrne, the chief constable, faces questions from the board overseeing the Police Service of Northern Ireland about the massive data leak. And Labour has accused the government of “catastrophic financial mismanagement”, claiming it has “lost” £251bn from the value of assets created to rescue the banking sector after the 2008 financial crash.

      "politics\/live\/2023\/aug\/09\/labour-keir-starmer-crime-charging-commission-trial-uk-politics-live Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, has signalled the government may be prepared to leave the European convention on human rights (ECHR) if it will help the UK tackle the problem of people arriving on small boats crossing the Channel. Lee Anderson, the Conservative deputy chair, has admitted that the government has “failed” on immigration. (See 11.22am.) Zac Goldsmith, the Conservative peer and close ally of Boris Johnson, has hinted he could be “very tempted” to back Labour and questioned again Rishi Sunak’s commitment to tackling the climate crisis. The UK government has announced a deal with Turkey to focus on coordinated actions to “disrupt and dismantle” people-smuggling gangs. Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach (Irish PM), has said that if power sharing is not restored at Stormont in the autumn, the UK and Irish governments need to work on a “plan B”. Speaking after talks with all the main Northern Ireland party leaders in Belfast, he said he hoped the DUP would lift its boycott of the power-sharing executive so it can reconvene in the autumn. But he went on: I do think, though, that if that opportunity is missed, if it’s the case that the institutions can’t be re-established in the autumn, well, then I do think at that point we have to start having conversations about alternatives, about plan B. That’s very much a conversation that I’m keen to have with the UK government. I don’t want to speculate too much at the moment, because I still believe it is possible to get the institutions up and running in the autumn. I do think the suspension has gone on for a long time. There is drift. And that’s not good for Northern Ireland. Asked what the “plan B” might be, Varadkar said he did not want to say. He went on: That’s kind of a conversation that we’re having some of the party leaders today, a conversation that I think we need to have between the British and Irish governments, because we’re not the sovereign government in Northern Ireland – we accept that. But we are co-guarantors of the Good Friday agreement and if the Good Friday agreement isn’t working, if institutions aren’t functioning, well, then it makes sense that the British and Irish governments work together to talk about what arrangements could be put in place. Asked if this meant joint authority, he added: I don’t mean anything specifically. I understand again why you’re asking that question but, as you know, there’s no provision for joint authority in the Good Friday agreement, there’s also no provision for direct rule in the Good Friday agreement. Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, has said he will leave the Senedd (Welsh parliament) at the next election. He has already said that he intends to stand down as first minister – a post he has held since 2018 – before the next Welsh parliamentary election in 2026. Speaking at the Eisteddfod today, Drakeford said that he would not stay on in the next parliament because he did not want to complicate life for his successor. As the BBC reports, he explained: It’s important to have a refresh. I think it is difficult for those who will be doing the work in the future to have people like me sitting behind them. I don’t want to do that. I think of it like Tony Benn – when he decided to leave the House of Commons, he said: ‘I’m going to stop being an MP in order to spend more time in politics.’ I’m not going to be a member of the Senedd after 2026 but I am not going to step back from the debate or stop thinking about Wales’ future. Drakeford posted this video on Twitter about his visit to the Eisteddfod, a Welsh language and cultural festival. Several readers have been asking how the UK could leave the European convention on human rights given that complaince with the ECHR is one of the safeguards cemented into the text of the Good Friday agreement, which is the foundation of the peace settlement in Northern Ireland. Alexander Horne, a lawyer and former legal adviser in parliament, is one of many people to have made this point on Twitter. All of this explains why proposing withdrawal from the ECHR would be hugely provocative and controversial. But does this mean that there is no chance at all of the Tories proposing movement on this issue in their next manifesto? Not quite. There are at least three reasons why. 1) Conservative party members care a lot more about small boats, and about leaving institutions with “European” in their title, than they do about Northern Ireland. Rishi Sunak may be opposed to leaving the ECHR (his precise views on this are not clear – see 10.02am) but, if he is, he is in a minority comprising fewer than a quarter of the Conservative party membership, according to a recent survey. Most Tory members want to withdraw. What about Northern Ireland? “Who cares?” seems to be the response of many. Arguably, if safeguarding the Good Friday agreement was a priority, the party would never have pursued Brexit in the first place. (Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU, and the current deadlock at Stormont is a direct result of the trade conditions it created.) Polling in 2019 showed that a majority of Tory members said they wanted Brexit to happen even if that were to lead to Northern Ireland leaving the UK. 2) Renegotiating the Good Friday agreement is not entirely unthinkable. The deal has been one of the great British diplomatic successes of the postwar period, and it has improved life in Northern Ireland immeasurably. But, as Arlene Foster said when she was DUP leader, it is not “sacrosanct”, and periodically there are calls for it to be reformed. For some, the crisis with power sharing is making the case for revision of the agreement even more compelling. 3) For some Tories, ECHR withdrawal may be more of a threat than a goal, anyway. Some believe that a hardball strategy by the UK government could lead either to the European court of human rights applying the convention less strictly, or the Council of Europe granting concessions that might make the Rwanda policy easier to implement. (Some in the Conservative party felt threatening to leave the EU might have the same effect on the European Commission; it didn’t.) Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, has said that he does not know when power sharing will be restored at Stormont. The power-sharing executive has not been functioning for 18 months because the DUP is refusing to participate until its concerns about the Northern Ireland protocol are addressed. Speaking after talks in Belfast with Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach (Irish PM), Donaldson said: The matters that we’re dealing with are essentially about the internal market of the United Kingdom, and that’s why the focus is on the UK government and ourselves in trying to find solutions. In terms of timescale, I don’t know at the moment how quickly things will move, but I am hopeful that we will see progress. I want to see that progress, but we need to get a solution. I don’t know if Stormont will be restored in weeks or months, that depends very much on the government’s response to our paper on the concerns that we have raised on the Windsor framework. Varadkar has been meeting all the main party leaders in Belfast. After her meeting with him, Michelle O’Neill, the Sinn Féin leader in Northern Ireland and first minister designate, said patience was “wearing thin” with the DUP. She said: I’ve heard more urgency from the taoiseach today than I’ve heard from the British government in terms of the need to restore the executive … We need an executive today. It’s long overdue, the public need it to be there fighting their corner, dealing with the budgetary situation that we have, fighting their corner in terms of good public services. There shouldn’t be any more delay as to that. Lord Falconer, who was justice secretary and lord chancellor in Tony Blair’s government, says Robert Jenrick’s suggestion today that the UK could leave the European convention on human rights is just one of several developments showing the Tories are undermining the rule of law. R Jenrick suggesting UK might leave ECHR, L Chancellor attacking lawyers acting lawfully in challenging govt action they disagree with, Home Sec blaming lefty lawyers for immigration failures. Deliberate undermining of law and lawyers by government. There will be consequences. Here is the video of Lee Anderson, the Conservative party’s deputy chair, telling Nigel Farage last night that the government has failed on immigration. (See 11.22am.) Nicola Sturgeon’s “deeply personal and revealing” memoir will be published in 2025 by Pan Macmillan, after nine publishers bid for it at auction. Lucy Knight has the story here. Zac Goldsmith, who resigned as a Foreign Office minister in June saying he could no longer support Rishi Sunak because of his “apathy” on climate issues, has told the BBC that he might even back Labour as a result. Goldsmith raised the prospect of supporting Labour in an interview with Hardtalk. But he said that would only happen if the Labour party adapted its green policies to put more focus on the natural environment and biodiversity – issues about which he feels particularly strongly. He told the programme: My concern about the Labour party at the moment - I don’t say this is a tribal politician, I’m not a tribal politician – is I think there is a blind spot on the natural environment. When the Labour party thinks environment, when it talks about the environment, it is thinking carbon – and taxation, regulation and all the things that go with that. The simple truth is there is no pathway to net zero and there’s no solution to climate change that does not involve nature, massive efforts to protect and restore the natural world. And at the moment, I’m not hearing any of that from the Labour party. If I do, if there’s a real commitment now the kind of commitment, frankly, that we saw when Boris Johnson was the leader, then I’d be very tempted to throw my weight behind that party and support them in any way I could. Goldsmith is close friends with Johnson and his wife Carrie – he lent them his holiday villa in Spain two years ago – and his resignation was seen in part as a member of the Johnson faction retaliating against Sunak for the role he played in Johnson’s demise. Goldsmith’s threat to endorse Labour at the next election may be seen in the same way. As a peer, Goldsmith will not have a vote at the election. A reader asks: Is the EU\/UK FTA under pinned by the ECHR and, if so, what are the ramifications of the UK leaving the ECHR? What are the likelihood of the repercussions? If the UK were to leave the European convention on human rights (ECHR), that would have an impact on the post-Brexit trade deal with the EU (the trade and cooperation agreement, or TCA). When the deal was being negotiated, the UK tried to avoid making it conditional on the UK remaining party to the ECHR. But it was not entirely successful. As Lisa O’Carroll points out in this story, written earlier this year, leaving the ECHR would lead to the law enforcement and judicial cooperation parts of the TCA being immediately suspended. On the subject of the ECHR, I have updated the post at 10.02am to say that in February Rishi Sunak said the UK “will remain a member of the ECHR”. (You may need to refresh the page to get the update to appear.) Other comments from Sunak have been more evasive, and what the Conservative party will say about this subject in its next manifesto is still unclear. During his morning interview round Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, covered quite a range of small boat-related issues. Here are more lines from what he said that haven’t been covered already. Jenrick said it was “naive” to think that reducing the backlog of asylum applications would by itself sort out the small boat problems. Reducing the time spent waiting for applications to be processed might just encourage more people to come, he said. When it was put to him that the backlog was “the nub of the problem”, he told Sky News: It isn’t the nub of the problem. But it is an important thing that we have to get right. I say that because there are those, such as the Labour party, saying that just if you process claims quickly, that will fix it. I think that’s a naive view. That’s what they did when they were last in office. And that just encourages more people to come. But it is right that we make the Home Office as efficient as possible and the good news is that we’re succeeding. This is not the first time Jenrick has made this argument; in May he told MPs that cutting the asylum application backlog could increase the number of asylum seekers coming to the UK. But it is a perilous line to take, because it implies the Home Office is not fully committed to reducing the backlog, and because Rishi Sunak has made cutting the backlog a priority. In December Sunak told MPs that claims should be processed “in days or weeks, not months or years”. Jenrick claimed that a “significant number” of migrants who originally turned down places on the Bibby Stockholm barge were now agreeing to move there. He said: We have written to those individuals who have so far declined to travel and, as I understand it, a significant proportion of them have already changed their minds and agreed to move. A significant number moved yesterday, I suspect more will move in the coming days. He confirmed that asylum seekers who refused to move to a barge might not be offered alternative accommodation by the government. He rejected claims that the UK was losing out because, as a result of Brexit, it was no longer party to the Dublin agreement that allowed people claiming asylum in the UK to be returned to safe countries in the EU they had travelled through previously. When this was put to him on the Today programme, Jenrick replied: No, I dispute that. The Dublin arrangement which you are referring to didn’t work well. In fact, in their last years of operation, more individuals were brought from the continent to the UK than were sent in the other direction, so the arrangement wasn’t working well. He confirmed that the UK was paying some money to Turkey as part of the deal to tackle people smuggling gangs announced today, but he refused to say how much. When asked what the sum was, he told GB News: I’m not able to say how much this morning, but what we are funding with Turkey is real investment in core law enforcement capability with a centre of excellence whereby Turkish national police will be training up to tackle this issue in Turkey. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, has welcomed Lee Anderson’s admission that the government is failing on immigraiton. She told the Today programme: [Anderson] did admit that the government is failing to tackle the boats crisis. What we need is grip rather than gimmicks, we need solutions rather than just this ramping up the rhetoric all of the time. And that is the problem – because they are failing, because they have been flailing around for years while they have just made things worse with the policies they have pursued, they have ended up now lashing out trying to promote division and trying to find someone else to blame. That is not what responsible governments do. They should be getting on with trying to solve the practical problems around the gangs and around the backlog. But, in her interview, Cooper criticised Anderson for saying yesterday that asylum seekers unhappy with barge accommodation should “fuck off back to France”. She said: It is clearly the wrong language to use and it is ramping up the rhetoric as a distraction from the fact the government is failing. One person likely to welcome Cooper’s condemnation is Anderson himself. In an interview with the Daily Express, which could be seen as confirmation that his reactionary soundbites are primarily crafted with the intention of provoking a reaction, he in effect complained that Labour MPs weren’t criticising him publicly over his France comment. Anderson told the paper: The leftwing mainstream media has gone into meltdown over my comments but, interestingly, I am yet to see one Labour frontbench MP disagree with my comments. Is this another U-turn from Labour because their silence is deafening. Lee Anderson, the Conservative deputy chair, has admitted that the government has “failed” on immigration. Anderson made the comment last night, in an interview with the former Ukip and Brexit party leader Nigel Farage on GB News. As the Telegraph reports, Farage put it to Anderson that the government had “completely and utterly failed everyone” on immigration. Anderson replied: Listen Nigel, I am not going to sit here and make excuses to anyone. This is out of control, we are in power at the moment, I am the deputy chair of the Conservative party, we are in government and we have failed on this. There is no doubt about it. We have said we are going to fix it, it is a failure. Anderson said the government had policies in place to address the small boats problem, such as the Rwanda deportations plan and the Illegal Migration Act, but he said progress “seems very slow”. He also said the government faced opposition from “lefty lawyers”, human rights groups and charities. He went on: Everything is against us but I am not making excuses. It is slowing us down. If the whole of parliament was behind us on this I am sure this would have got through by now. Liberty, the human rights group, has expressed alarm at the suggestion that the Conservative party could support leaving the European convention on human rights. (See 10.02am.) In a tweet it said: The European Convention on Human Rights protects everyone in the UK The rights and freedoms we’re all familiar with come from it Dragging the UK out of the ECHR will allow the Government to knowingly commit human rights abuses against anyone Robert Jenrick has suggested he would not rule out backing a parliamentary move to punish Nadine Dorries for not attending parliament as a means of forcing a byelection. Dorries, the former culture secretary, had infuriated many MPs, including her colleagues, by her failure to formally resign her seat despite her announcing in early June that she was going to do so “with immediate effect”. All three main English parties are gearing up for a byelection in her Mid Bedfordshire constituency, and her non-resignation has focused attention on how little work she appears to be doing as an MP. She has voted in the Commons six times this year, and has not spoken in the chamber since last summer. Last week Sunak criticised Dorries, saying she was not properly representing her constituents. Today, in an interview with Sky News, Jenrick, the immigration minister, used similar language to Sunak. But he went further in hinting that he might back a parliamentary move to oust Dorries. Asked if it was time for Dorries to go, Jenrick replied: Yes. I think being a member of parliament is a special privilege. You sign up for a term in office. If you decide you want to leave parliament for whatever reason, you need to get on and do that. I don’t think that Nadine Dorries’ constituents are being properly represented. I hope she’ll reach that conclusion soon. Jenrick was then asked if he supported a proposal from Sir Chris Bryant, the chair of the Commons standards committee, to force Dorries out. In an interview with the Financial Times, Bryant, who is promoting his new book on conduct in parliament, said he favoured resurrecting a parliamentary rule from 1801 stating that “no member do presume to go out of town without leave of this house”. Bryant suggested that a process like this could end up with Dorries being suspended for more than 10 days, which would trigger a recall petition and then a byelection (if the 10% threshold were met). On Monday, asked about the Bryant proposal, Downing Street declined to endorse it, and said ultimately it was for constituents to decide who should serve as an MP. But when Jenrick was asked about the plan, he sounded more enthusiastic. Asked if he would support Bryant’s proposal, he replied: I’m not familiar with the details of his proposal, I know he’s relying on quite an arcane piece of legislation. Obviously the government will consider that, but it’s probably a matter for the House of Commons rather than for the government. And so if he brings forward serious proposals, then as individual members of parliament we’ll have to consider. Dorries, who is a loyal Boris Johnson supporter, has said that before she resigns as an MP she wants to get a proper explanation as to why she was blocked from getting a peerage in his resignation honours. She has not responded to the recent criticism of her attendance record in parliament, or her failure to quit, but yesterday she did post a message on Twitter accusing Bryant of being a publicity seeker. Ahh, Chris Bryant has a book out – well, I never. This latest bout of publicity seeking was so unlike him… All is now clear… Dorries, of course, is no slouch when it comes to publicity-seeking. Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, has suggested that the government might withdraw from the European convention on human rights if that offers the only means of stopping asylum seekers coming to the UK on small boats. Asked if leaving the ECHR was an option for the government, Jenrick said the government would “take whatever necessary action is needed”. Jenrick was responding to a question prompted by a BBC report saying senior Conservatives believe the party will campaign on a manifesto proposing ECHR withdrawal. The report, by Nick Eardley, also quotes an unnamed minister claiming the UK is being “punished” by the European court of human rights, which enforces the convention, because of Brexit. Rishi Sunak has played down the prospect of leaving the ECHR, arguing that the UK is instead in a good position to secure reforms to how the European court operates that might help it implement its Rwanda policy. But Sunak has never ruled out leaving the convention, or the court, and one recent survey showed that 70% of Conservative party members wanted the UK to leave the convention. Suella Braverman, the home secretary, has in the past said she agrees with this view, although she now tends not to say that publicly because it is not government policy. In an interview with Times Radio, asked if the government was ruling out withdrawal from the convention, Jenrick replied: You can see from the prime minister, the home secretary and myself, our total commitment to this challenge. That’s why we’re working on every possible front. That’s why we have produced the most comprehensive plan, I believe, of any European country to tackle this issue. And we’ll do whatever is necessary ultimately to defend our borders and to bring order to our asylum system. Asked if “whatever is necessary” might include leaving the ECHR, Jenrick replied: We will do whatever is required, take whatever necessary action is needed. UPDATE: A reader points out that in February, in a Commons statement on the Windsor framework, Rishi Sunak told the Labour MP Alison McGovern that the UK “will remain a member of the ECHR”. See the clip below. McGovern raised the question because the Good Friday agreement is based on the UK remaining party to the ECHR, and so withdrawal could upset the peace settlement in Northern Ireland. But, on other occasions when asked about this, Sunak has been more evasive, and No 10 has never said Sunak is committed to staying in under all circumstances. No one expects the government to leave before the general election, but whether or not to include the option of leaving in the next Conservative manifesto is something that is being discussed within the party. Good morning. In August, as “normal” political news dries up, journalists are more dependent than usual on what the political parties are offering and the government is still banging away with announcements designed to show that it is dealing with the small boats problem. Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, has been promoting a deal with Turkey intended to tackle illegal migration. The Home Office statement is here, and our story about the initiative is here. But today Labour has got its own, rival announcement. It is about crime, and how to ensure more crimes lead to suspects being charged, and it is inspired in particular by this chart in the document Keir Starmer published earlier this year explaining his “making Britain’s streets safe” mission. It shows the detection rate for offences in England and Wales has fallen by 60% since 2015. Labour says that, in addition to proposals it has already announced to deal with this (more neighbourhood police officers, more people working as crown prosecutors), it will set up a charging commission to ensure more cases go to trial. It says a body is needed to speed up the process because the time taken to charge suspects is getting longer (up from 14 days, on average, in 2016, to 44 days now), and because 2.4m cases were dropped due to evidential difficulties in the past year. Another problem is the huge increase in the proportion of victims who just give up on wanting to see a case through. In an article for the Daily Mirror, Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, says a charging commission is needed because, for every 500 people who get burgled, only 20 cases go to court. She says: Across England and Wales today, over 500 people will have their home broken into. Only 20 of those burglars will face court. Shockingly, less than 5% of burglaries are solved. For violent crime the figures are worse. More than 5,000 people will face a violent attack or abuse today alone. But less than 300 of the criminals responsible will face court. Under the Tories the proportion of crimes that are solved has dropped by two thirds. Bluntly, more criminals are getting off, more victims are being badly let down. The Labour commission will be chaired by Dame Vera Baird, a former Labour MP and former victims’ commissioner. Explaining what it would do, she said: Investigations and prosecutions for serious crimes like rape are in a dismal state, the criminal justice system is in chaos, and things simply cannot stay as they are. This commission will bring together voices from across policing and prosecutions to forensically investigate the causes of this charging crisis, and set out robust recommendations for recovery. Jenrick and Cooper have both been doing media rounds this morning. I will post the highlights shortly. If you want to contact me, do try the “send us a message” feature. You’ll see it just below the byline – on the left of the screen, if you are reading on a PC or a laptop. This is for people who want to message me directly. I find it very useful when people message to point out errors (even typos – no mistake is too small to correct). Often I find your questions very interesting, too. I can’t promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either in the comments below the line, privately (if you leave an email address and that seems more appropriate), or in the main blog, if I think it is a topic of wide interest.\n",
      "politics\/2023\/aug\/08\/target-of-tory-lefty-lawyer-dossier-forced-to-review-security-after-email A lawyer who was targeted by a Conservative party dossier sent to right-leaning newspapers has been forced to review her security after receiving an “ominous” email in the wake of critical articles, she has said. Jacqueline McKenzie, the head of immigration at Leigh Day and a partner at the firm, said a briefing sent to the Telegraph, Mail, Sun and Express by party officials was “underpinned by racism and misogyny”, inaccurate and calculated to whip up ill-feeling. In an article for the Guardian, McKenzie wrote: “The hit job on me was vile and self-serving, and put me and those close to me at considerable risk of physical harm. I’m having to take security advice and precautions, such is the seriousness of one email I received ... “This flagrant attack on my rights, built on misinformation and mischaracterisation and underpinned by racism and misogyny, is a dark day for our political sphere. It represents a serious slur on the integrity and independence of thousands of hardworking and upstanding lawyers.” McKenzie said she realised she was being targeted by the Tory party on Saturday when she was contacted by several newspapers asking for a response to the four-page briefing. The party’s document, which had the heading, “Revealed: senior Labour advisor is lefty lawyer blocking Rwanda deportations”, sought to highlight McKenzie’s links to the party and her work on immigration cases, she said. However, it did not mention that she had also advised and attended meetings with several Conservative ministers and spent “90%” of her time working on Windrush claims. The Tory dossier said: “Just last year, she [McKenzie] helped a Jamaican criminal lodge last-minute appeal to deportation because of his high blood pressure. The foreign-born crook had just served an eight-year prison sentence for kidnapping. “[Labour leader Keir] Starmer has been keen to distance himself from previous remarks and convince voters that he can be trusted on immigration. “But his decision to hire lefty lawyer Jacqueline McKenzie is further proof that ‘Sir Softie’ can’t be trusted.” In her article, McKenzie wrote that she had not been hired by Labour. “I am an unpaid volunteer on a working group set up by Labour to look at race disparities across a number of indicators, just as the Conservatives did with the Sewell report.” She added: “There was mention of a case in which I represented a Jamaican man who had lived in the UK from the age of nine and was facing deportation.” The dossier and subsequent news articles came amid other criticisms of lawyers challenging the government’s right to put asylum seekers on the Bibby Stockholm, the barge in Portland, Dorset, she said. “Judging by the vast amount of support I’ve received, not only from friends and colleagues, but from many strangers too, this government hit job has spectacularly backfired.” A Conservative party spokesperson said: “It’s no secret that an activist blob of leftwing lawyers, dubious campaign groups and the Labour party are trying to frustrate our efforts to stop the boats and deport more foreign criminals.”\n",
      "politics\/live\/2023\/aug\/08\/suella-braverman-immigration-lawyers-asylum-bibby-stockholm-uk-politics-live Lee Anderson, the deputy chair of the Conservative party, has been accused of “stoking up division and hate” against migrants. The Labour mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, denounced Anderson for saying asylum seekers unhappy about being asked to live on a barge should “fuck off back to France”. But, in comments supported by No 10, Alex Chalk, the justice secretary, said Anderson was articulating the “righteous indignation of the British people”. (See 10.18am, 1.13pm, 1.24pm and 1.44pm.) The Home Office spent more than £1,500 of public money painting over cartoon murals that were meant to welcome children to a controversial asylum reception centre, it can be revealed. The data of millions of voters was accessible to hackers in a cyber-attack by “hostile actors” discovered almost a year ago, the Electoral Commission has admitted. Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach (Irish prime minister), has said Northern Ireland could remain without a power-sharing executive until after the next general election if the deadlock is not broken within the next couple of months. Power sharing has been suspended for 18 months because the Democratic Unionist party is boycotting the executive until it secures changes to the Northern Ireland protocol, the post-Brexit trading deal that creates some new rules for goods being traded between Britain and Northern Ireland. The Windsor framework, the new version of the protocol that Rishi Sunak negotiated with the EU, was supposed to assuage DUP concerns. But the DUP has still not endorsed it and Northern Ireland has gone from thinking power sharing would return after the May local elections, to thinking it would happen in the autumn, to thinking, now, it may not even happen then. In an interview with the Financial Times, Varadkar said he still hoped the executive would revive in the autumn. But he went on: It is more hope than expectation at this stage, to be frank. If we don’t seize this window of opportunity in the next couple of months, talk will turn both in Belfast and in London to the next Westminster elections and it might be after that before we can get things going again. Varadkar said he thought the Irish and UK governments should “work hand-in-glove and apply both pressure and support  …  in a co-ordinated way” to get the executive restored. But Rishi Sunak did not favour this approach, he said. There has been a reluctance, I suppose, in Downing Street, to go down that route. The FT report quotes a UK government official saying involving the Irish government in efforts to restore power sharing would cause problems with unionists. The Home Office spent more than £1,500 of public money painting over cartoon murals that were meant to welcome children to a controversial asylum reception centre, Rajeev Syal reports. Luke McGee, European policy editor at CNN, says comments like those from Lee Anderson today (see 10.18am) affect how the UK is seen abroad. He does not mean for the better. According to the Daily Telegraph, the latest green measure being targeted by Conservative MPs is the plan to ban the installation of new oil boilers in off-grid homes from 2026. The paper says “more than 30 Tory MPs have already written to the prime minister to raise the issue, amid concern it could disproportionately affect rural Conservative communities”. One of the MPs concerned is George Eustice, the former environment secretary, who represents Camborne and Redruth in Cornwall. He told the paper: Rural communities are about to have their own version of the Ulez [ultra low emissions zone] dumped on them … They should call off the ban on the sale of boilers and pursue a different strategy which would be to properly incentivise renewable fuels in those boilers. The Sun says it has spoken to an Iranian asylum seeker who was taken to the Bibby Stockholm barge yesterday who told the paper: “It’s OK, I like it.” Suella Braverman has tweeted a picture of the meeting she chaired today as part what the government calls its “clampdown on crooked lawyers who coach illegal migrants to lie”. Yesterday it was reported that at least two people had reportedly turned down honours nominations from Liz Truss, with one apparently being too “humiliated” to accept one from the UK’s shortest-serving prime minister. But 14 names remain on the list, according to a report in the Times. Today the Conservative peer Lord Cormack said it was “absurd” to let Truss have a resignation honours list given how little time she served as prime minister. Cormack told the World at One. It’s absurd to think that somebody who was in office for such a short space of time, and who was not only the shortest-serving British prime minister in our history, but also the most expensive – to think that she should be able to dole out honours to people. What can they have done in the 40 days and 40 nights that she was in No 10 to be worthy of honours? I think it brings the whole system into disrepute. I know it places the prime minister in an awkward situation, and I’m very sorry for him … But I think he should say no, and he could easily say that he’s not going to have one either, however long he serves. I just think it is not necessary. [Not all prime ministers have one]. It’s been fairly abused by her predecessor [Boris Johnson] and it would be complete nonsense – and, frankly, an insult to the nation – for her to have a list after such an ignominious period in No 10. Suella Braverman, the home secretary, has said that at the start of July there were 218 unaccompanied child asylum seekers being housed in hotels. The Home Office tries to place child asylum seekers who are on their own with foster parents, but it uses hotels when foster placements are not available. Braverman gave the figure in a letter to the Commons home affairs committee responding to questions raised by the committee at a hearing in June. In her letter, which has been published by the committee today, she also said: Only 52 of the 154 young asylum seekers who were in hotel accommodation but who went missing earlier this year were still under the age of 18 on 27 July. Between 13 December and 1 June, 1,788 Albanians were returned to Albania. Braverman gave this figure in response to a question about how many of the 12,000 Albanians who came to the UK in small boats in 2022 had been returned. She did not say who many of the 1,788 Albanians were small boat arrivals from last year. Downing Street has said that Alex Chalk was speaking on behalf of the government when he defended Lee Anderson’s “fuck off back to France” comment about migrants unhappy with being asked to live on a barge (see 10.18am), Liz Bates from Sky News reports. Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, has accused Lee Anderson, the Conservative party deputy chair, of “stoking up more division and hate” with his comment about asylum seekers published this morning. (See 10.18am.) He posted this on what most of us still call Twitter. Language matters. This lot have been in Government for 13 years. After their abject failure all that’s left is stoking up more division and hate. We deserve so much better. The Electoral Commission, the UK’s elections watchdog, has been targeted by a cyber-attack that enabled “hostile actors” to access electoral registers. The full story is here. Lee Anderson, the Conservative party deputy chairman, has been tweeting this morning in the light of the controversy generated by his “fuck off back to France” remark. (See 10.18am.) Both tweets feature dubious claims. The first is directed at the left in general. Note to the Left. Every illegal migrant that crosses the Channel from France is taking the place of someone genuinely in danger in a refugee camp. Why can’t you see that these fit healthy young men are actually preventing help reaching those desperate people who really need it? This comment reflects Rishi Sunak’s argument that stopping small boats is justified on the grounds of “fairness” because people who claim asylum after arriving in the UK illegally are cheating because they are in effect jumping the queue, and taking up asylum places that should go to people who apply through the legitimate asylum routes. But the problem with this argument is that most people from countries where they are at risk of war or persecution do not have what Sunak or Anderson would describe as a legitimate route to claiming asylum in the UK. A Tory MP made this point very effectively last year when he left Suella Braverman, the home secretary, floundering at a home affairs committee hearing because she could not say what her “safe and legal” asylum routes were for a hypothetical refugee. Anderson also responded to a critcal tweet from Diane Abbott. (See 11.19am.) Wrong again @HackneyAbbott I told illegal migrants to go back to France not genuine asylum seekers. Btw not seen you in Parliament for a few months. Are you on leave or have you said something daft again? This tweet implies that asylum seekers unhappy about being housed on a barge (the ones he said should return to France – see 10.18am) are not genuine asylum seekers. Since their applications have not been decided, it is impossible to know for sure. But there is no evidence to back Anderson’s assertion that all their claims will be bogus, and the latest Home Office data suggests that most of them are genuine. In 2022 76% of initial asylum applications that were processed were accepted – “a substantially higher grant rate than in pre-pandemic years and the highest yearly grant rate since 82% in 1990”, the Home Office said. The Home Office added: Of the top 10 nationalities applying for asylum, half have a grant rate above 80% (Afghanistan 98%, Iran 80%, Syria 99%, Eritrea 98%, and Sudan 84%). Rishi Sunak has said that one of his five priorities for this year will be stopping the small boats crossing the Channel. No 10 presents this an absolute pledge to “stop the boats”, not just as a promise to implement measures that might reduce small boat crossings, although Sunak himself has been evasive as to what counts as the pledge being met. According to new polling from YouGov, 80% of Britons have little or no confidence that Sunak will reduce the number of asylum seekers crossing the Channel in small boats. The overall figures are similar for Conservative voters and Labour voters, although Tories are more likely to say they are “not very” confident the promise will be kept, while Labour supporters are more likely to say they are “not at all” confident. While these numbers look dreadful for the government, if 80% of people suspect there will be no reduction in the number of people crossing the Channel in small boats this year, Sunak would at least be exceeding expectations if he achieved even a modest reduction. According to the tracker run by Migration Watch UK, a thinktank that campaigns for tighter controls on migration, small boat crossings are currently 17% lower than the figure for the same point in 2022. YouGov also found that three-quarters of Britons think the government’s plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda is unlikely to go ahead. The Foreign Office has announced fresh sanctions against Russia, which it says will limit Vladimir Putin’s access to foreign military equipment. The sanctions cover 22 individuals and businesses outside Russia “supporting Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, as well as three Russian companies importing electronics vital to Russia’s military equipment used on the battlefield”, the Foreign Office said in a news release. The Andrew Malkinson miscarriage of justice story has highlighted two anomalies with the system by which victims in these cases receive – or do not receive – compensation. One was the surprise revelation that victims of miscarriage of justice could have money deducted from their compensation payment to cover their living costs while in jail. Alex Chalk, the justice secretary, has scrapped this rule, and this morning said this might be backdated (which in theory would allow three people who did lose out because of this to get their money back). See 11.17am. The other relates to the threshold for getting compensation. Partly as a result of a law passed in 2014, prisoners who have a conviction quashed do not qualify for compensation unless new evidence shows “beyond reasonable doubt” that they did not commit the offence. There have been calls for this rule to be changed too, on the grounds that it is unfair. But in his Today interview this morning Chalk signalled that he was opposed to changing this rule. He said that if he lowered this threshold, that would lead to people who were clearly guilty, but who were freed on a technicality, getting compensation. He said: Let me give you two quick examples. I remember a case back 10 years ago now, horrible GBH in a pub, someone had their hands nearly severed, two people convicted, they went into custody and so on. And yet, whilst they’re in custody, it emerged that the indictment, that’s to say the charge sheet upon which they had been tried, was defective because it hadn’t been signed. And as a result, the court of appeal, I think the supreme court, decided to quash those convictions and they were released. Now, is it right in those circumstances, where there’s no doubt, everyone knows that they committed the crime, that they should be entitled £100,000. Or what about terrorists who have been convicted, and yet it emerges after their conviction that the state gave an undertaking that they wouldn’t be prosecuted, and therefore the convictions are quashed as an abuse of process? Long before it was docked in Dorset, the Bibby Stockholm was used by the Netherlands to also house asylum-seekers. While the barge has since been refurbished, its use in Rotterdam in the early 2000s sparked complaints over the cramped accommodation and poor living conditions of those onboard. In 2006 a reporter with the Dutch Magazine Vrij Nederland went undercover as a security guard on the barge. At the time, 472 asylum seekers were living on the boat. The journalist, Robert van de Griend, said it was like a jail. He wrote: Calling the prisoners ‘inhabitants’ and the cells ‘rooms’ seems like a bad joke. People are packed here on top of each other. The ceilings on the boat are low and the corridors so narrow that it’s hard not to bump into each other. The four-person cells are inhumanely small, no larger than twenty square metres. It’s stuffy and there’s not much light coming in. His observations were echoed in a 2008 report by Amnesty International, in which a 32-year-old asylum seeker told the campaign group that conditions on the boat were “very difficult”. The asylum seeker quoted in the report went on: There were four people in a cell, which caused frequent fights over the use of the television, cleaning the cell and the noise. There is only a little daylight in the cells, which makes reading difficult. Moreover, the ventilation in the small cell is insufficient to keep the cell fresh; when someone went to the toilet the smell would fill the whole cell. In the morning the guards would open the cell with their nose covered to protect themselves against the stench which filled the cell overnight. The Netherlands eventually stopped using the barge following the opening of new facilities for asylum seekers. In June of this year, a Home Office spokesperson said the Bibby Stockholm had “completed a statutory inspection and refurbishment”. Diane Abbott, who was shadow home secretary when Jeremy Corbyn was Labour leader, has described Lee Anderson’s latest outburst (see 10.18am) as “a new low even for the Tories”. Alex Chalk, the justice secretary, has said he is “considering” backdating new rules which mean that wrongly convicted people will no longer have prison living costs deducted from their compensation payments, PA Media reports. PA says: The minister made the reform with immediate effect on Sunday after the outrage sparked by the miscarriage of justice case centring on Andrew Malkinson. Malkinson, who spent 17 years in prison for a rape he did not commit, had his conviction quashed after DNA linking another man to the crime was produced. The 57-year-old quickly expressed concern that the rules meant expenses could be deducted from any compensation payment he may be awarded to cover the costs of his jail term. In response, Chalk updated the guidance dating back to 2006 to remove them from future payments made under the miscarriage of justice compensation scheme. Speaking to broadcasters this morning, he suggested he may go further by backdating the change after Malkinson and Sir Bob Neill, the Tory MP who chairs the Commons justice committee, called for wider reform. He told BBC One’s Breakfast programme: “Certainly since 2006 there have been three cases where deductions have been made, and none in the last 10 years. “Of those three cases, the reductions from their compensation award have been 3% and 6% so it’s important to get some perspective. “There’s also issues around the public interest, about retrospectivity – normally there’s a rule that says you shouldn’t make rules retrospective but I’m considering this all in the round.” Yesterday 15 asylum seekers were moved to the Bibby Stockholm barge in Portland, but dozens more who were due to go there had their transfer postponed because of legal action. We don’t know the full details of the legal arguments involved, but the Care4Calais, the refugee charity helping many of the migrants, said people who were disabled, who had survived torture and who had had a traumatic experience of being at sea, were among those objecting to being housed on the barge. According to a report by Charles Hymas in the Daily Telegraph, Suella Braverman, the home secretary, is threatening to withdraw accommodation from asylum seekers who refuse to move to the barge without a reasonable excuse. He quotes a government source saying: Anyone refusing to move without a reasonable excuse has 24 hours to reconsider, after which their asylum support will cease and they will have to fend for themselves. In his Today interview this morning Alex Chalk, the justice secretary, was asked if it would be legal to leave migrants homeless in this way. He said that ultimately this would be a matter for the courts to consider, but he said it was “unlikely” that this would be ruled illegal. He said that accommodation on the barge was “basic”. But it was “perfectly safe” and “perfectly decent”, and it was “not unreasonable” for the government to say asylum seekers should have to live there, he said. He explained: If people were therefore told, ‘Right, if you don’t want to come on the barge, that’s it, the state has discharged its duty to you’. You’re putting to me, would that be an illegal position? Would that be an unlawful stance to take? My position is it’s unlikely that would be unlawful. In other words, I suspect that would be lawful. But that would have to be considered in the normal way. As the first asylum seekers moved into the Bibby Stockholm barge at Portland, many charities and campaigners (see here, here and here, for example) complained about the conditions in which they were being housed. In an interview with the Daily Express, Lee Anderson, the Conservative deputy chairman, delivered a characteristically blunt response. He told the paper: If they don’t like barges, then they should fuck off back to France … I think people have just had enough. These people come across the Channel in small boats. If they don’t like the conditions they are housed in here then they should go back to France or better not come at all in the first place. Asked on LBC if Anderson was speaking on behalf of the party, Chalk defended what he said, arguing that his Tory colleague was expressing the “righteous indignation of the British people”. Chalk said: Lee Anderson expresses the righteous indignation of the British people. Yeah, he does it in salty terms and that’s his style. But his indignation is well placed. People are coming from a safe country. France is a signatory to the European convention on human rights, and people should claim asylum in the first country. It shouldn’t be like a sort of open shopping list of where you want to go. So he expresses himself in his characteristically robust terms, but there is a lot of sense, in my respectful view, in what Lee says. On the Today programme Nick Robinson, the presenter, reminded Chalk that after Brexit he said that Britain should be a “tolerant, outward-facing nation” and that he did not want to see a return of “the kind of ugly bigotry that I thought we had left long behind”. Asked if what Anderson said was the language of a tolerant and outward-facing nation, Chalk replied: I think that this is absolutely fine. I have no difficulty with that. It’s not bigotry at all. This country, lest we forget, has offered its home to 400,000 people since 2015: Ukrainians, people from Hong Kong, Afghans. We are an open and warm and outward-facing country. But equally we’re a country that believes in fairness and playing by the rules, and those who don’t play by the rules, who don’t take advantage of those opportunities we provide, and try to jump the queue, rightly cause indignation. And I think Lee was expressing that indignation in his own way, but there was nothing unreasonable in principle about what he was saying. Alex Chalk, the justice secretary, has been giving interviews this morning to promote the announcement about the “professional enablers taskforce”, the group set up to facilitate enforcement action against what Suella Braverman calls “crooked immigration lawyers”. (See 9.11am.) In an interview with Today, Chalk said there was a difference between the lawyers who are knowingly helping people make false claims and those who were helping asylum seekers with legitimate claims. Asked if the government was criticising the lawyers who launched the legal challenges that prevented some migrants being moved to the Bibby Stockholm barge yesterday. Chalk said what they were doing was legitimate. He said: You are absolutely right to draw a distinction. People who are making stuff up deserve, frankly, the full force of the law, the law should come down like a ton of bricks. Yes, the government is frustrated, of course, by legal challenges. Those legal challenges aren’t improper of themselves, but we will be challenging them because we take the view that they are misguided, they are wrongheaded, they are last-minute, they are … completely misconceived. (Many lawyers believe that a lot of the “lefty lawyer” rhetoric from senior ministers in recent years, including Braverman and Rishi Sunak, does elide the distinction between corrupt solicitors, and the majority working on immigration cases honestly and professionally, and that this is deliberate.) Although Chalk said that he was not criticising lawyers for pursuing legitimate claims, he claimed that recently lawyers have become increasingly political. This was regrettable, he said. The strong tradition of lawyers in this country is that you simply act for your client without fear or favour, and you don’t necessarily associate yourself with that cause. But I think it is fair to point out that in the last 10 years there has been a growing, and I think regrettable, trend for lawyers to actively parade their politics and to identify more with their clients. And if they can avoid that, they should avoid it. It’s much better, I think, for lawyers in the main to keep their politics to themselves and to simply do the job on behalf of the clients. But some seem to be much more willing, and indeed almost enthusiastic, about parading their political opposition. I think that’s a mistake. In his Today programme interview David McNeill, head of public affairs at the Law Society, argued that the problem with the asylum system was not false claims, but the backlog of applications caused by delays in dealing with them. He told the programme: Most asylum claims are successful. Those claims which are unsuccessful go to appeal; over half are granted on appeal. There’s something fundamentally wrong with this system. He also said the Illegal Migration Act would make the situation worse. Describing it as a “really flawed piece of legislation”, he said: On a practical level the government doesn’t have sufficient number of places in secure accommodation and the plan is to put everybody in secure accommodation for 28 days. It doesn’t have sufficient numbers of return agreements with other countries such as Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, so actually even if you wanted to return asylum seekers it can’t because there isn’t a return agreement. So what they are going to create is a new group of this 50,000 in hotels, basically a new group of asylum seekers in legal limbo, and it will just make the situation worse. Good morning. It’s day two of what is down on the No 10 grid as “small boats week” and this morning the government is publicising the existence of the “professional enablers taskforce”, a group set up to beef up enforcement action taken against lawyers who knowingly help migrants make false immigration claims. The taskforce has been running for a while now, but the Home Office has decided to promote it today, with a press release quoting Suella Braverman, the home secretary, saying: Crooked immigration lawyers must be rooted out and brought to justice. While the majority of lawyers act with integrity – we know that some are lying to help illegal migrants game the system. It is not right or fair on those who play by the rules. Aubrey Allegretti has written up the story for the Guardian here. But the story is getting the biggest show in the Daily Mail, which is particularly interested in the topic of “crooked immigration lawyers” because they recently published an investigation that led to the Solicitors Regulation Authority closing three law firms where there was evidence (obtained undercover by the Mail) exposing lawyers or legal advisers telling someone posing as an economic migrant how to fabricate a story that might allow them to successfully claim asylum. Lawyers accept that conduct of the kind exposed by the Daily Mail is wrong, and that the perpetrators should be punished. But the government has been criticised this morning for presenting this as part of a wider crusade against “leftie lawyers”. David McNeill, head of public affairs at the Law Society, told the Today programme this morning: It’s not in our interest to have any solicitor acting improperly or crookedly, but this announcement today is something of a red herring. This task force which they tout with such aggressive language has been in existence for months now so really from our perspective it just looks like a bit of lawyer-bashing as a distraction from really bad news for the government on the number of asylum seekers now accommodated in hotels, 50,000, problems with processing asylum claims – the backlog is continuing to be extremely bad with cases taking over a year – and also the quality of the case work. McNeill’s argument was broadly endorsed by Lord Garnier, a Conservative peer and former solicitor general. He was also on on the Today programme and, asked what he thought of government rhetoric about lawyers, he replied: Attacking judges, attacking lawyers, purely for political rhetoric is a waste of time, and I’ve said as much on the floor of the House of Lords. I’ve been accused of many things but one thing I’ve not been accused of being a lefty lawyer, but I do believe in the rule of law. And if people would concentrate on what they’re supposed to be doing, rather than deflect by attacking others, we might have a rather more productive set of affairs. Alex Chalk, the justice secretary, has been defending the government’s stance in an interview round. I will post his comments shortly.

I can’t promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either in the comments below the line, privately (if you leave an email address and that seems more appropriate), or in the main blog, if I think it is a topic of wide interest.\n",
      "politics\/2023\/aug\/08\/sexually-assaulted-mp-labour-chris-bryant The chair of the House of Commons standards committee has said he has been sexually assaulted by fellow MPs on several occasions during his time in parliament. Chris Bryant, the Labour MP for Rhondda, has made the revelation in his new book, Code of Conduct, Why We Need to Fix Parliament – and How to Do it. “Over the years five male MPs have felt my bottom uninvited,” he wrote in the book, extracts of which have been published by the i paper. “One of them, who was not out, did so repeatedly. Another, who is still in the house and still does not accept that he is gay, pushed me against a wall and felt my crotch. Another rubbed himself behind me in the queue to vote and was later snogging two men in the Strangers’ Bar. I know other gay MPs and staff who have faced the same.” Bryant has been prominent in drawing attention to misconduct in parliament, and is senior among those charged with upholding standards among MPs. This has made him a target, with extra scrutiny on his own propriety. But he has said he favours being forthright about his failings, rather than trying to portray himself as a saint. Among those failings, he acknowledged, has been contributing to the hushing-up of bad behaviour that had allowed it to flourish in parliament. Last year, he told LBC radio: “I remember when I came out in 2001, I was regularly touched up by older, senior, gay – they weren’t out – MPs. I never felt I was able to report it because you end up being part of the story, and that’s the last thing you want. And I think a lot of women have been through that.” He added: “I can think of four MPs in division lobbies. I was shocked at the time and I bet you could guess who the four MPs are.” In his book, he says: “I can be impulsive, sanctimonious and pompous.” And: “I know there are occasions when I have got my facts wrong, and the whirligig of politics has spun so fast I haven’t corrected the record.” He called for influence over the parliamentary timetable to be shared in the Commons in order to improve the functioning of the political system at Westminster. He said he believed many problems were caused by the “winner takes it all mentality”, the i reported. For example, he said it was counterproductive to give the government almost total control over the legislative timetable. “The Labour party aspires to be the party of the people. So, you would think that the spreading of power would be fundamentally part of a Labour project,” he said.\n",
      "politics\/live\/2023\/aug\/07\/small-boats-home-office-asylum-seekers-ascension-island-rwanda-policy-uk-politics-live-latest The first group of asylum seekers due to be housed on the Bibby Stockholm barge in Portland, Dorset, have been taken onboard. Given that polling suggests voters are more likely than not to see this as an acceptable option for single, male migrants, ministers may view the arrivals as a success. But the news coincided with No 10 having to in effect disown reports saying the government was seriously considering sending asylum seekers to Ascension Island, only hours after a Home Office minister claimed this option was on the table. (See 12.31pm.) Labour said the government media strategy for the week was “descending into chaos”. (See 2.48pm.) Labour has revealed that the number of asylum seekers in hotel accommodation has risen by 25% since Rishi Sunak said, in December, that he wanted to stop the practice. (See 2.48pm.) GB News is being investigated for four further potential breaches of impartiality rules, as the media regulator Ofcom struggles with the rightwing channel’s willingness to push the boundaries of British broadcasting rules. The growing crisis facing the NHS presents “quite a few business opportunities” for AXA to expand its private healthcare business, the French insurance group’s chief executive has said. Earlier Colin Yeo, an immigration barrister, posted tweets critical of the government’s plan to increase the fines for employers and landlords who employ or house migrants who do not have a lawful immigration status. (See 11.18am.) He has firmed up his view in a post on his Substack account in which he says the proposals are likely to be counter-productive and could have “disastrous consequences”. You can read the post (for free, or by taking out a subscription) here. And here is an extract. There is no evidence that the existing system is working or that increasing the level of fines will improve the effectiveness of the system. In fact, there is reason to think that increasing the level of fines might make the system less effective in that good faith employers will not know any better what they are supposed to do and may well end up being closed down by this change. It is unlikely to have any impact on serial offender employers. If the increase in the level of fines is about raising more revenue, there is reason to think that it will fail at that as well, because the new fines would simply lead a lot of employers to close or go bankrupt. Trying to pay a fine of £15,000 per worker was hard enough for a small employer. Paying £45,000 per worker is simply going to be impossible. This sort of measure has become the hallmark of this fag-end government. It sounds tough. In reality it is likely to be counter-productive. It may well have unintended and disastrous consequences for individuals and employers acting in good faith but caught out by incredibly complex and ever-changing immigration law requirements. Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former leader of the Commons and former business secretary, has said that sending asylum seekers to Ascension Island would be “impossibly expensive”. In an interview with GB News, he said he was involved in the talks on whether this was feasible when he was in government, and ministers concluded it would cost around £1m a head. He explained: I was involved in some of the discussions looking at this whilst I was a member of the government and unfortunately it would cost at least a million pounds per person you sent there to do it … You’ve got to send out Portakabin residences for your builders, then you’ve got builders who have to live there whilst they’re doing the building, then you have to build the premises for the migrants to live in, then you’ve got to persuade people that they want to go and live on Ascension Island for long periods to run the centre. And the costs just went up and up and up and up. And that’s why when I was involved in the discussions, it was just thought to be impossibly expensive to do. Susan Aitken, the SNP leader of Glasgow city council, says the UK government wants to put asylum seekers on a barge in her city. The council will not allow that, she says. Aitken’s comment has been retweeted by Humza Yousaf, Scotland’s first minister. As the National reports in its story on this, Edinburgh city council has already told the Home Office that it is opposed to plans to put asylum seekers on a cruise ship docked at Leith. Carralyn Parkes, the Labour mayor of Portland town council, has condemned the conditions on the barge being used to house asylum seekers in her local port. She told Sky News: It’s awful to think that this government, in the 21st century, would even consider housing some of the most vulnerable people in the world on a barge in Portland Port. She said that the barge was designed to house 220 people, but that it would now be taking more than twice as many people. She went on: I took a tape measure on board with me when I went on the Bibby Stockholm. I measured three of the cabins and they averaged around 10 feet by 12 feet. They’ve got bunk beds and so you’re talking about two people being accommodated in these rooms. The rooms are small, the bunk beds are small as well, the mattresses are about six feet long. So if you’re a tall person, you’ve got a problem. The bathrooms are clearly made for one person. They’re not made for two people. Originally they were talking about accommodating people between three and six months. Now it’s nine. So you’re not talking about it being a short-term solution. It’s going to be somebody’s living space for a considerable amount of time. The corridors are narrow, everything is small. Parkes also said the port was a secure area, which meant “you can’t just wander in and out of it”. The asylum seekers would have to be bused in and out, she said. And they would have to go through airport-style security. So in practice they would not have complete freedom of movement, she said. The Green party says that, instead of having a week of announcements linked to its “stop the boats” strategy, the government should instead make it “welcome refugees week”. Benali Hamdache, the party’s spokesperson on migration and refugees, said: No barge is a suitable home for refugees. Most people who reach our shores and claim asylum are doing so completely legitimately due to fleeing war, persecution, discrimination or climate breakdown. The vast majority are desperate people who need to be met with compassion. Housing them in a barge is to treat them as prisoners and is heartless. The Green party would open safe and legal routes for asylum seekers. With such routes many refugees would not be forced into making a dangerous crossing of the English Channel. We want this week and every week to be ‘Welcome Refugees Week’. The Greens say they would house refugee families in houses or flats, and single asylum seekers in a room of their own if they were in shared accommodation. The party would also allow them to work while their applications were being processed. The British Red Cross has joined Amnesty International UK (see 3.20pm) in putting out a statement today criticising the government’s decision to house asylum seekers on a barge. Alex Fraser, the charity’s UK director for refugee support and restoring family links, said: We know from our work supporting men, women and children seeking asylum that these sites will be entirely inappropriate for people and will lead to significant suffering. People who have been forced to flee their homes have already experienced unimaginable trauma. They need stability, support, to be able to maintain contact with their loved ones and to feel safe. We find ourselves in this position as a direct result of the failure to tackle the asylum backlog, with over 172,000 people living in limbo. We need a more effective and compassionate asylum system, one that supports people to integrate into a community so they can find safety and live in dignity. Greenpeace has accused Downing Street of a “bunker mentality” after it said the campaign group should not have “a seat at the table in discussions with government” following its protest on the roof of the PM’s home in Yorkshire. (See 1.23pm.) Will McCallum, Greenpeace’s UK co-executive director, said: Burying your head in the sand isn’t going to make the climate crisis go away. It’s precisely because the government has effectively shut the door to civil society groups, like Greenpeace, as well as ignoring warnings from the UN, its own advisers and the International Energy Agency, that we need to protest in the way that we do. The bunker mentality on display from this current government is deeply damaging – cutting ties with Greenpeace isn’t going to help. We represent the views of millions of our supporters and have a mandate to hold the government to account. A reader has been in touch to point out that, according to the Portland History website, a prison ship was docked in Portland harbour from 1997 to 2005. HM Prison Weare was a category C prison for adult men. It looked very like the Bibby Stockholm. Amnesty International UK has restated its opposition to asylum seekers being housed in barges. Commenting on the first people arriving on the Bibby Stockholm, Steve Valdez-Symonds, the charity’s refugee and migrants rights director, said: It seems there’s nothing this government won’t do to make people seeking asylum feel unwelcome and unsafe in this country. Reminiscent of the prison hulks from the Victorian era, the Bibby Stockholm is an utterly shameful way to house people who’ve fled terror, conflict and persecution. Housing people on a floating barge is likely to be re-traumatising and there should be major concerns about confining each person to living quarters the typical size of a car parking space. Labour’s ideological closeness to the Democrats puts the party in an ideal position to sign trade deals with the US should both parties win their elections next year, Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow trade secretary, has said. Kiran Stacey has the story here. The Labour party has just put out a news release claiming that the government’s small boats media week is “descending into chaos”. The statement is mostly about figures showing that hotel use for asylum seekers has gone up since December, when Rishi Sunak said he wanted to end the practice, but Labour is also citing the duff briefing about Ascension Island (see 12.31pm) as evidence of “chaos”. In December, as part of a package of measures intended to “stop the boats”, Sunak said: “It’s unfair and appalling that we are spending £5.5m every day on using hotels to house asylum seekers. We must end this.” But Labour says Home Office figures show that on 30 June there were 50,546 asylum seekers in hotel accommodation, which it says marks a 25% increase on the figure for December (around 40,000). Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said: Rishi Sunak is failing to fix the Tories’ boats chaos and the Conservatives are just flailing around chasing headlines rather than getting a grip. The prime minister admitted last December that hotel use was a serious problem and promised to end it, but instead since then it has gone up by a truly shocking 25% with more asylum hotels still opening, and the taxpayer having to pay billions more pounds as a result. This is the direct consequence of Tory mismanagement and their disastrous failure to speed up asylum decisions or clear the backlog which is still at a record high. On Ascension Island, Labour said: With no workable plan, the government has resorted to reheating proposals that were floated – and abandoned – three years ago to send asylum seekers to the Ascension Island. Despite clear briefings to the media yesterday, the Home Office already seem to be retreating from this this morning. Labour is assuming that the government wanted the Times and the Daily Mail to splash on the Ascension Island story this morning. Perhaps it did. But it is equally possible that this was just a cock-up. Lobby journalists do publish stories that have not been sanctioned by No 10, and when Sarah Dines, a junior minister, confirmed the stories this morning (see 9.33am), maybe she just did not know what she was meant to say. Labour is also criticising Dines for confirming that section of the Illegal Migration Act saying the home secretary is under a duty to remove migrants who arrive in the UK illegally to a third country has not yet come into force. Originally this law was meant to apply to people arriving from 7 March. But No 10 has defended this delay, on the grounds that until the supreme court says people can be deported to Rwanda, detaining people and removing them, using the terms of the Act, won’t be possible. GB News is being investigated for four further potential breaches of impartiality rules, as the media regulator, Ofcom, struggles with the rightwing channel’s willingness to push the boundaries of British broadcasting rules, Jim Waterson reports. Harry Cole from the Sun says the government did take advice on whether it could send asylum seekers to Ascension Island, but was told this would be unworkable. Right some clarity, of sorts, on Ascension Islands. Advice sought at HO on using it since change of government last October. That has come back – and by all accounts says its unworkable and not going to happen. Not formally been ruled out at ministerial level - but see above. Officially No10 will not comment on ongoing discussions about any other Rwanda style agreements elsewhere. But off the record the Ascension Islands is in the bin, yet bizarrely government won’t just say that. A cynic would suggest they are happy to let the hollow threat run. The refugee charity Care4Calais, which is supporting some of the asylum seekers who have been told they are being moved to the Bibby Stockholm, says it has stopped around 20 people being moved on to the barge, Sky News reports. Here are more lines from the Downing Street lobby briefing. The PM’s spokesperson confirmed that the government is talking to other countries to see if they would be able to take asylum seekers arriving in the UK, as Rwanda says it will. The Times claims there have been talks with Ghana, Nigeria, Namibia, Morocco and Niger. The spokesperson would not confirm those names, or say what other countries were being considered. But he did say some EU countries were also engaged in similar talks. Asked specifically about Niger, where they has recently been a coup, he said that any agreement would have to be with a safe third country. The spokesperson said it was wrong to say that Rwanda has said it could only take 200 asylum seekers from the UK. He said that report just referred to a specific site, and that Rwanda was “more than capable” of taking more people. The spokesperson said the government was keeping dangerous dogs legislation under review. That was in response to a question about the Daily Mirror’s campaign calling for the laws to be tightened. The spokesperson backed the decision by the environment secretary, Thérèse Coffey, to stop her department engaging with Greenpeace after it staged a protest at the PM’s home in Yorkshire. “We don’t think that people accused of breaking the law should have a seat at the table in discussions with government,” the spokesperson said. The spokesperson would not confirm a claim from Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader and China hawk, that China installed a tracking device in at least one official government car. But the spokesperson said “very comprehensive security measures” were in place. This is what the PM’s spokesperson said at the Downing Street lobby briefing when asked if Sarah Dines, the Home Office minister, was right to say this morning that 500 asylum seekers could be on the Bibby Stockholm barge by the end of the week. (See 9.33am.) My understanding, and I think the Home Office have sought to clarify, that is about the upward capacity of the Bibby Stockholm rather than the numbers we are looking to get in by the end of the week. Numbers will increase over time as you would expect for any new asylum facility. Asked whether the minister misspoke, the spokesperson replied: All I would say is that my understanding is that the Bibby Stockholm has an upward capacity of 500. We are looking to [reach] that number over time – I don’t think we are aiming to do it by the weekend. Pro-migrant campaigners in Portland have been delivering welcome packs to the Bibby Stockholm barge for asylum seekers. That didn’t take long. While the No 10 “small boats week” media operation seemed to be going quite well at 8am this morning, by noon it was looking less of a triumph. In her media round this morning Sarah Dines, the Home Office minister, confirmed in effect that the government was considering sending asylum seekers to Ascension Island (see 9am) and said that the Home Office hoped to have 500 migrants on the Bibby Stockholm by the end of the week (see 9.33am). The Downing Street lobby briefing has now finished, and on both these points No 10 was in corrective mode. The PM’s spokesperson made it clear that the government does not expect to have 500 asylum seekers on the Bibby Stockholm by the end of the week. Asked about background briefing from the Home Office saying Dines misspoke (see 11.24am), the spokesperson said the 500 figure referred to the “capacity” of the barge, not the number of people expected to be in it by Sunday. Asked when it would be full, he replied: “I don’t think we are setting a deadline for that.” The spokesperson played down suggestions that the government was seriously considering sending people to Ascension Island. Asked about these reports, the spokesperson said the government was “confident” it would win its case at the supreme court and be allowed to remove migrants to Rwanda. Asked specifically about the Ascension Island proposal, the spokesperson refused to discuss the story, claiming it was not appropriate to discuss specific other country options. But he did not repeat what Dines said about “all possibilities being considered”, and reporters at the briefing came away with the clear impression that this is not a proposal being taken seriously within government. I will post more from the lobby briefing soon. Here is Rajeev Syal’s story about the first asylum seekers arriving on the Bibby Stockholm. The first asylum seekers have arrived on the Bibby Stockholm barge in Portland, Ali Fortescue from Sky News is reporting. According to a report in the Times, Liz Truss named 16 people on her original honours list – four for peerages, and 12 people getting other honours. Two people have declined, but there are still 14 names on the list, the Times says, one person for every four days she was in office. The Labour MP Chris Bryant says resignation honours lists should be abolished. Diane Abbott, who is currently suspended from the parliamentary Labour party, says it is “outrageous” that Truss gets to give out honours. And the Lib Dem peer Paul Tyler says it would make more sense to let the lettuce produce an honours list instead. The Home Office’s rebuttal team have been busy this morning. According to Harry Cole, the Sun’s political editor, they are privately briefing that the reports about people possibly being sent to Ascension Island are nonsense. Bit of an awkward morning for the Home Office... Junior minister on the radio saying they are “looking at everything” when quizzed on Ascension Island migrant yarn But spin-doctors trying to kill the story saying its nonsense and never going to happen and was abandoned in 2020 Cole says they are also saying Sarah Dines, the Home Office minister, misspoke when she said the Bibby Stockholm could be housing 500 asylum seekers by the end of the week. Home Office minister said there could be 500 migrants on the Bibby Stockholm by the weekend.. Dines: “Yes, quite possibly it will be 500. We are hoping.” Now told by the Home Office that she “misspoke” and the 500 target is not this week but overall. We will get the on the record line from No 10 at the lobby briefing, which starts shortly. England’s national parks would be “destroyed” by proposed government rules that would allow landowners to convert barns into houses without planning permission, critics have said. Helena Horton has the story here. Colin Yeo, a barrister specialising in immigration law, has posted a good thread on Twitter on the government’s plans to increase the fines for employers or landlords who employ or house people without a lawful immigration status. He says that, even at their current levels, many of these fines never get paid, because businesses just close instead, and that a report from the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration four years ago suggested that fines should be decreased, not increased, to improve compliance. Here is an extract from the report cited by Yeo. Inspectors heard different views from IE [immigration enforcement’ senior managers about whether the current level of a civil penalty was appropriate. Some thought it acted as a definite deterrent, but others said it was too high, as having to pay £15,000 to £20,000 would bankrupt many companies. Companies that were already largely compliant needed the “nudge” of a smaller fine rather than a large penalty, and the latter should be reserved for those companies that consistently and knowingly flouted the immigration laws. Labour shadow ministers have not found it easy to explain their policy on housing asylum seekers on barges. In an interview yesterday Stephen Kinnock, the shadow immigration minister, said that if migrants were housed in barges or former army camps when Labour took office, it would not be able to remove them immediately, but that it would hope to end the practice quickly, as it tackled the backlog of asylum claims. With the nuance missing, this became a splash headline in the Metro saying: “Labour – we’ll use migrant barges too.” Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow international trade secretary, gave an interview to the Today programme this morning and he was evasive when asked if Labour was in favour of asylum seekers being housed on the Bibby Stockholm barge today or this week. But he did say that, in principle, Labour was not in favour of an asylum system that required the use of barges as accommodation. He said: We do not wish to run and will not run an asylum system that requires the use of bases, barges or indeed of hotels. Those are being used as additional accommodation because of the failure of the Conservatives to run our asylum system properly over many years. Thomas-Symonds claimed that these forms of accommodation were being used because of the government’s failure to process asylum claims swiftly. Sunder Katwala, who runs British Future, a thinktank focusing on migration and identity issues, says there is no realistic prospect at all of the government sending asylum seekers to Ascension Island, at least before the general election. He posted this on what most of us still call Twitter. Any commentator who treats the ludicrous Ascension Island “proposals” as having even a 1% chance of happening before general election shows themselves to be either entirely unserious (if actually believed that) or deeply cynical (if just pretending it could happen) He also says the last time this proposal was floated in the media, three years ago, there were claims it might have been leaked to discredit the then home secretary, Priti Patel. In Autumn 2020, @conhome suggested this highly implausible brainstorm had been leaked to discredit Patel and the Home Office. Maybe was then. Its clear that this new Mail splash &amp; Times story in August 2023 are government’s idea with Home Office quotes Prof Dame Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), told the Today programme that her organisation has a migrant team that expects to visit the Bibby Stockholm barge once the first asylum seekers have been moved there. Most of them would have a health assessment before they arrived, she said. She went on: We know the accommodation complies with marine standards, which is what’s been agreed is correct for the particular accommodation. Generally respiratory infections, as we’ve all learnt through the pandemic, are at higher risk in confined settings with poorer ventilation, so the sorts of things we look at is what the ventilation is like. We will actually have a visit, and I know the Home Office have agreed to that, once the migrants are there to check out some of the infection prevention control. In her interviews this morning Sarah Dines, the Home Office minister, was asked about the asylum seekers who will be placed on the Bibby Stockholm barge in Portland. Here are the main points she made. Dines refused to confirm that the first asylum seekers would be moved onto the barge today, although she would not deny that either. On the Today programme she said they would be moving in “pretty soon, imminently, this week, in the coming days”. Asked why she could not just say it would be today, she told LBC she could not be specific “for security and operational reasons”. She said the Home Office hoped to have 500 asylum seekers on the barge by the end of the week. On the Today programme, asked if 500 people would be on the Bibby Stockholm by the end of the week, she replied: Yes, quite possibly it will be 500. We are hoping. She said the government was putting asylum seekers on a barge because it wanted to show that people coming to the UK on small boats would not end up in “luxurious” accommodation. She told Sky News: [Using a barge] sends is a forceful message that there will be proper accommodation but not luxurious. Luxurious hotel accommodation has been part of the pull, I’m afraid. There have been promises made abroad by the organised criminal gangs and organisations which have tried to get people into the country unlawfully and they say: ‘You will be staying in a very nice hotel in the middle of a town in England.’ That needs to stop and the barge is just one of a wide range of other measures. She said people on the barge would have “some free movement”. Asked if they would be able to travel off the boat and onto the isle of Portland, where the barge is docked, she told LBC: They’re going to have some free movement. You know, we’re a democratic country, of course. But there are going to be some parameters to that. They’ve got medical supplies on board. They’ve got a gym on board and various activities to keep them occupied. But of course, they’re going to be able to stretch their legs, get some air, get out and about, but within proper parameters. She insisted the barge was “a safe place for people to live and stay”. Good morning. Downing Street has reportedly decided that today marks the start of “small boats week” in terms of its summer news grid and, on the basis of today’s front pages, whoever is running the No 10 spin operation seems to be, so far, doing a pretty good job. The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Express have both splashed on an announcement from the Home Office about fines for people who employ or rent property to migrants without a lawful immigration status are rising sharply. This morning the BBC news is leading on reports that the first asylum seekers will be moved onto the Bibby Stockholm barge in Portland today. And, not content with “is happening” news, the Times and the Daily Mail are both splashing “might happen” reports saying that the government is considering deporting asylum seekers who cross the Channel in small boats to Ascension Island, the British overseas territory 4,000 miles away in the south Atlantic. In his Times report Matt Dathan says: Ministers have resurrected proposals to send illegal migrants to Britain’s overseas territories as part of alternative options to tackle the small boats crisis … The volcanic island, 4,000 miles from the UK in the middle of the South Atlantic, was previously considered as a location to process asylum seekers. Ministers believed its remote location would create a strong deterrent factor for migrants planning to cross the Channel in small boats. Using Britain’s overseas territories forms part of a range of “plan B” contingencies that have been discussed by ministers and officials in case the government’s policy to deport migrants to Rwanda has to be abandoned. The government is also in negotiations with at least five other countries over a similar deportation deal to the one agreed with Rwanda last year, The Times understands. This involves sending asylum seekers on a one-way flight to another country rather than taking them to an overseas territory temporarily. Sarah Dines, a Home Office minister, has been doing an interview round this morning, and she in effect confirmed that the Ascension Island option was being examined. Asked on Times Radio if the Times and Daily Mail reports were correct, she replied: We are pretty confident that Rwanda is a legal policy. The high court and the lord chief justice found that it was, so that is what we are focusing on. But like any responsible government, we look at additional measures, so we are looking at everything to make sure our policy works. We need to reduce the pull factor of illegal criminal gangs getting people to this country, basically abusing the system. On the Today programme, when it was put to her that Ascension Island was a “plan B” in the event of the supreme court deciding deportations to Rwanda are unlawful, Dines said she would not use the terms “alternative” or “plan B”. But she went on: “We are looking at additional schemes across the globe, of course we are.” And on Sky News, asked why the Home Office was considering Ascension Island when it examined, and rejected, this option three years ago, Dines replied: Well, times change. We look at all possibilities. This crisis in the Channel is urgent, we need to look at all possibilities and that is what we are doing. I will post more from her interviews shortly. It’s August, and parliament is in recess, and so the political news diary is fairly empty. But we will get the only No 10 lobby briefing of the week at 11.30am.

      "politics\/2023\/aug\/04\/uk-thinktanks-urged-to-be-transparent-about-funding-as-1m-us-donations-revealed Transparency campaigners have called for thinktanks to be more open about their funding sources, after it emerged that some of Britain’s most influential ones received more than $1m (£787,000) from donations in the US in 2021. They include the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), regarded as an inspiration for policies adopted by the Liz Truss government, and Policy Exchange – a conservative thinktank used as a platform by ministers to trail new measures and which recently incubated hardline immigration plans. Steve Goodrich, head of research and investigations at Transparency International UK, said: “Ensuring transparency around who funds our politics is essential for public confidence in how our democracy works. “It is particularly concerning that those organisations with the most opaque funding arrangements are seemingly those getting the biggest hearing from ministers. We would urge any thinktank seeking to influence policy development to declare their funding sources and be transparent about their governance.” Policy Exchange, where Truss was head of economic and social policy before entering politics, received almost $100,000 from a foundation controlled by Leonard Blavatnik, who has joint US-UK citizenship and was listed this year by the Sunday Times Rich list as Britain’s third-richest man. The organisation’s American arm received $34,786 in 2021 from the Blavatnik Family Foundation 2020 – which is run by Blavatnik’s brother Alex – “to support and advance the program of policy exchange between the UK and US”. It also took more than $270,000 from the family foundation of Yan Huo, a hedge fund magnate with US citizenship who has donated more than £1m to the Tories, including £200,000 shortly before the 2019 general election. The IEA’s US wing, American Friends of the Institute of Economic Affairs (AFIEA), has accepted $118,000 since 2020 from the Sarah Scaife Foundation, a private foundation set up by the billionaire libertarian heir to an oil and banking dynasty. The IEA is believed to have inspired many of the free-market policies pursued by Truss and the then-chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng. Some of her staff worked at the IEA, and she founded its political wing, Freer. Truss spoke at more of its events than “any other politician over the past 12 years” according to the head of the IEA. The figures on US funding were identified by the investigative journalist Peter Geoghegan, who analysed recently published US tax documents. Tom Brake, the director of Unlock Democracy, a pressure group campaigning for greater transparency from thinktanks, said the figures “underlined the urgent need to break the secrecy that surrounds the funding of many of the UK’s thinktanks”. He added: “Some thinktanks exert huge influence over government. For that reason, we need to understand who stands behind them financially and what their agenda might be. They aren’t innocent bystanders.” Policy Exchange and the IEA have long faced questions about their refusal to name their donors. They argue that they respect their backers’ right to privacy unless the backers wish otherwise. Critics say the lack of transparency allows unseen donors to influence political debate. Policy Exchange did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the IEA said AFIEA was a separate organisation. They added that AFIEA’s contact details were available on the IEA website. It states: “A United States donor wishing to support the work of The IEA may make a donation to American Friends of the Institute of Economic Affairs.” A spokesperson for the Huo Family Foundation (UK) said it had made three grants to Policy Exchange – £100,000 in 2019, 2020 and 2021 – and that the funding was restricted for work in education. They added that all grant giving is done by the UK Foundation, but there is a US entity, Huo Family Foundation (US), which owns 100% of Huo Family Foundation (UK). Neither Yan Huo nor the Huo Family Foundation had supported Policy Exchange since 2021. A Blavatnik Family Foundation spokesperson said: “In 2020-2021, The American Friends of Policy Exchange received a donation totalling GBP100,000 ($132,762) from the Blavatnik Family Foundation.” The Guardian has previously reported that millions of dollars were raised from anonymous US donors to support British rightwing thinktanks that were among the most prominent in the Brexit debate. A Guardian analysis in 2018 established that $5.6m (£4.3m) had been donated to these US entities since 2008. They included the IEA, Adam Smith Institute and Legatum Institute, which are all part of the Atlas Network. It has described itself as “a global network of more than 475 free-market organisations in over 90 countries to the ideas and resources needed to advance the cause of liberty”.\n",
      "politics\/live\/2023\/aug\/02\/rishi-sunak-net-zero-targets-despite-new-oil-and-gas-licences-labour-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live Here’s a roundup of the key developments from the day: Rishi Sunak has signalled he will struggle to achieve two of his five priorities: to halve inflation by the end of the year and to reduce NHS waiting lists in England, which he blamed on striking workers. The prime minister urged voters to trust him with the economy, as he admitted inflation was not falling as fast as he would like. Nadine Dorries is failing to represent her constituents, Rishi Sunak has said in a rare attack on his senior Conservative colleague, who has refused to formally resign despite announcing her intention to do so almost two months ago. The prime minister criticised the former culture secretary, who has not spoken in the Commons for more than 12 months, saying “people deserve to have an MP that represents them, wherever they are”. The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) is demanding a meeting with Suella Braverman to raise concerns over fire safety in asylum seeker accommodation, including the Bibby Stockholm barge. The FBU has written to the home secretary with concerns about a potential lack of entrance and exit points on the barge, narrow corridors and doorways and increased occupancy. Grant Shapps has insisted that the Bibby Stockholm barge that will house asylum seekers is not a “deathtrap”. Rishi Sunak is now under increasing pressure to explain why the government persists in planning to use the barge, which has been condemned by refugee organisations for being costly, cruel and inhumane. Housing asylum seekers on the Bibby Stockholm “floating prison” would be “inhumane” and risks “retraumatising” people who have escaped war zones and other “horrors”, the leader of a refugee charity has warned. Steve Smith, the chief executive of Care4Calais, also expressed his fear that the barge being prepared to accommodate more than 500 refugees at Portland, Dorset was an “accident waiting to happen”. The bosses behind Britain’s multibillion-pound clean energy rollout gathered in Downing Street to discuss the government’s plan for green economic growth later on Wednesday. Grant Shapps, the energy secretary, is expected to meet the leaders of energy companies including EDF, SSE, Shell and BP, which are poised to invest billions in low- and zero-carbon projects. Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary, has suggested electric vehicle mandates could hamper investment in Britain and lead to job losses, in a sign that another of the government’s green pledges is in doubt. The business secretary was discussing the automotive industry’s concerns about a rule to be introduced in January that will require manufacturers to ensure at least 22% of new sales in the UK are of emissions-free models, rising each year to reach 80% by 2030. While Badenoch has made headlines by lobbying the cabinet to water down rules in the ban on new petrol and diesel cars, Labour has committed to the target. Louise Haigh MP, Labour’s shadow transport secretary, said: “The transition to electric vehicles is essential to net zero, essential to economic growth, and essential to the future of our automotive industry.” Shapps has said it would be “irresponsible” not to grant new oil and gas licences in the North Sea and insisted the UK would “still meet our net zero targets”. The energy security secretary said that the North Sea basin was very mature and was “effectively running out”. Scottish ministers will be able to spend hundreds of millions more on public services each year after striking a deal with the UK Treasury to lift restrictions on its budgets. The agreement will allow ministers in Edinburgh to double their annual borrowing to protect day-to-day spending to £600m. The higher education minister, Robert Halfon, has decisively ruled out lifting the cap on student tuition fees in England, despite increasingly urgent predictions from vice-chancellors about the impact of declining funding on universities. We are closing this liveblog now. Thanks so much for joining us and for all your comments and emails. You can follow our liveblog on the Ukraine-Russia war here: The higher education minister, Robert Halfon, has decisively ruled out lifting the cap on student tuition fees in England, despite increasingly urgent warnings from vice-chancellors about the impact of declining funding on universities. In an interview with Times Higher Education (THE), the minister said he recognised that some universities were facing challenges, but he said raising student tuition fees in the context of a cost of living crisis was “just not going to happen, not in a million years”. Halfon’s intervention will come as a blow to vice-chancellors, who say the £9,000 tuition fee, introduced in 2012 and increased to £9,250 five years later, is worth little more than £6,000 to universities, having been eroded by soaring inflation. The current freeze is in place until at least 2024-25. It will also reignite the debate about the growing recruitment of international students, whose higher fees are used to help plug the funding gap created by the now-devalued domestic tuition fee, amid fears that some domestic students could lose out on places as a result. Read the full story here: The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) is demanding a meeting with Suella Braverman to raise concerns over fire safety in asylum seeker accommodation, including the Bibby Stockholm barge. Health and safety checks have delayed plans to move the first 50 asylum seekers onto the barge in Portland, Dorset, due to happen this week. Fears have been expressed that the barge could become a “floating Grenfell” and endanger the lives of vulnerable people who have fled hardship and war. The barge was originally built to house 222 people but is now expected to house more than 500. The FBU has written to the home secretary with concerns about a potential lack of entrance and exit points, narrow corridors and doorways and increased occupancy. Ben Selby, FBU assistant general secretary, said: As firefighters, we are driven by the need to prevent loss of life and protect public safety. Everyone has the right to live in safe and decent housing, no matter where they are from. The government has already scrapped vital fire safety measures for asylum seeker accommodation. Now, it wants to put more than 500 people onto an off-shore barge designed to hold around 200. This is a cruel and reckless approach to the welfare of asylum seekers, and puts the safety of firefighters at risk. The letter to Braverman from Selby, which the Guardian has seen, says: The FBU believes fire safety standards are universal and apply to everyone. These matters are both industrial and political. They matter because our members will be called upon in the event of an emergency. They also matter to us because fire and rescue is a humanitarian service, designed to protect everyone regardless of their circumstances or background. Fire does not discriminate and therefore neither should safety regulations. Firefighting operations on vessels such as the Bibby Stockholm provide significant challenges and require specialist training and safe systems of work. The diminished safety provisions only exacerbate our operational concerns. The FBU has also criticised the government’s plans to exempt asylum seeker accommodation from requirements for an HMO licence. The HMO licensing process gives local authorities a duty to check that adequate safety measures and equipment is in place. Rishi Sunak is heading to California for what he says will be a “special trip” with his family this summer. The prime minister is flying to the US on Wednesday with his wife, Akshata Murty, and his two daughters, Krishna and Anoushka, for their first “proper” family holiday in four years. Explaining why they were heading to California, he told Nick Ferrari’s LBC radio show: We’re going to California, which is where I met my wife, so it’s very special to us, but the kids are very excited because I’m taking them to Disneyland. He also said he relaxed best by “spending time with my girls, which I don’t do enough of”, but did manage to watch the Barbie film with them recently, which was “very pink” but provided “good escapism”. Despite lobbying from the business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, it seems the government is keeping the 2030 car target after advice from industry. Emma Pinchbeck, chair of Energy UK, the UK’s largest energy trade association, was at a meeting in Number 10 Downing Street with the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, today. She said: I believe many in government fully understand the link between policy certainty and supply chain jobs (as with the Tata factory) and will be making that case across to colleagues. The treasury also know that fewer incentives will be needed to get supply chain here if order books are full. Scottish ministers will be able to spend hundreds of millions more on public services each year after striking a deal with the UK Treasury to lift restrictions on its budgets. The agreement will allow ministers in Edinburgh to double their annual borrowing to protect day-to-day spending to £600m, as well as increase the amount they can borrow for major projects by inflation and also keep underspends in later years, without any limits. The deal also preserves a longstanding agreement where the Treasury heavily subsidises Holyrood’s spending under the so-called Barnett formula, which redistributes spending around the UK, subsidising less wealthy areas. The Treasury said that element of the updated fiscal agreement meant Scottish ministers had £8bn more to spend last year than they would have had if Scottish spending was set at the same per capita rate of spending for the UK as a whole. The new £600m figure for day-to-day borrowing ensures that Scotland can fill any holes in its day to day spending if its income tax receipts fall below forecasts. If there are shortfalls in tax receipts, Scottish ministers can borrow money to cover the gap but that money must be repaid to the Treasury. That shortfall has grown to £390m, which breached the previous £300m borrowing limit. The Treasury has agreed to double that to £600m. Scotland’s other borrowing limits will also be permanently pegged to inflation using a method known as index per capita, which ensures Scotland does not lose out financially because its population is growing more slowly than the UK’s. Ministers in Edinburgh have been pushing for that reform for some time. John Glen, chief secretary to the Treasury, said: This is a fair and responsible deal that has been arrived at following a serious and proactive offer from the UK government. We have kept what works and listened to the Scottish government’s calls for greater certainty and flexibility to deliver for Scotland. [These] are the clear benefits of a United Kingdom that is stronger as a union. Read the full story here: Grant Shapps said there appeared to be a “misunderstanding” about the path towards petrol and diesel-free cars when asked about reports that the business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, had voiced concerns that electrical vehicle targets could stall investment. Asked about the reports, the energy secretary told the BBC’s World at One programme: Sometimes I think there’s some misunderstanding about the overall trajectory to cars which are no longer petrol or diesel. He said by 2035 there would be no petrol and diesel cars sold, but the 2030 deadline was to end the sale of “pure” petrol and diesel cars. Shapps added: The idea from next year is a mandate which requires a certain proportion. The government hasn’t actually said what that proportion will be yet and I think … the Department for Transport will shortly publish the upshot of that consultation, so at least wait for that. Opposition parties have joined in calls for Nadine Dorries to stand down following Rishi Sunak’s comments that her Mid Bedfordshire constituents “aren’t being properly represented”. Dorries, who has not spoken in the Commons for more than 12 months, announced on 9 June that she would “immediately” quit as MP after she was denied a peerage in Boris Johnson’s resignation honours. But she is yet to formally tender her resignation. Peter Kyle, the MP leading Labour’s campaign in Mid Bedfordshire, said: If Rishi Sunak is so concerned that people in Mid Beds aren’t being properly represented, he should show some leadership and tell Nadine Dorries to step aside. He is once again showing that he’s too weak to lead a Conservative party which is too divided to govern the country. The Liberal Democrat deputy leader, Daisy Cooper, repeated demands for Dorries to stand down: When your own prime minister says you aren’t doing your job properly, it really is time to go. There is real anger on the doorsteps in Mid Bedfordshire from former lifelong Conservative voters who are switching to the Liberal Democrats. Families are facing soaring bills and are finding it almost impossible to get a GP appointment, while this government is wrapped up in sleaze and the Conservatives’ MP is nowhere to be seen. Both Labour and the Lib Dems scent a chance to snatch the Tory safe seat. Mid Bedfordshire has been held by Dorries since 2005 and by the Conservative party since 1931, but the Tories are wary of any electoral challenge as they lag far behind Labour in the polls. Dorries held it in 2019 by 24,664 votes over second-placed Labour, but the Lib Dems hope they can continue a run of four byelection wins under their leader, Sir Ed Davey. Rishi Sunak has signalled he will struggle to achieve two of his five priorities: to halve inflation by the end of the year and to reduce NHS waiting lists in England, which he blamed on striking workers. In his final interview before heading to California with his family for their first holiday in four years, the prime minister urged voters to trust him with the economy, as he admitted inflation was not falling as fast as he would like. Yet when he was confronted by a constituent during the LBC radio phone-in with the fact that four independent businesses in his constituency of Richmond, North Yorkshire, were forced shut their doors last week, he insisted “business is good”, despite admitting that some businesses were struggling because of inflation. Weeks after health service bosses privately told ministers that the NHS pledge would be impossible to meet if strikes disrupted care beyond the summer, Sunak argued junior doctors and consultants were to blame for not accepting pay deals. In a conversation with a junior A&amp;E doctor who gave her name as Liv, he said: “That’s what’s causing the waiting lists to go up, I don’t think that’s right. “I would say to them I’m very grateful and respectful of the incredible job you do, but we all have a shared mission to bring the waiting lists down.” But Liv responded: “I think it’s amazing we’re blaming the increase in waiting lists on doctors going on strike. You’re losing staff because we are undervalued and it’s not just doctors, it’s everyone, we’re all leaving. A happy workforce is your responsibility.” With the Bank of England announcing whether interest rates will be raised again on Thursday, the prime minister repeatedly stressed that halving inflation was his most important priority as it would be “transformative for how people feel about their situation”. He said on Nick Ferrari’s LBC show. I know families are struggling with the cost of living and that’s why I set it out as my first priority to halve inflation, and we’re making progress. Is that as fast as I’d like? No. Is it as fast as anyone would like? No. But the numbers most recently that we had show that we’re heading in the right direction, inflation is coming down, and I think people can see light at the end of the tunnel. We’ve got to stick to the plan, it’s not easy to bring down inflation. It requires me to make difficult but responsible decisions on behalf of the country. Sunak was challenged by a constituent who said Tory policies were “causing small businesses to shut up shop” and that the impact of Brexit and the difficulty in finding staff had left people without a disposable income. The prime minister replied that, when he spoke to breweries at a London beer festival, “many of them were telling me that actually business is good, that footfall is up, that they’re seeing confidence return”. Read the full story here: While the business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, has made headlines by lobbying the cabinet to water down rules in the ban on new petrol and diesel cars, expected in 2030, Labour has committed to the target. Badenoch has reportedly said the rules would hit automobile businesses, but Labour said that companies needed the goal to kickstart investment in new factories and jobs. Sources in the party said major manufacturers had invested billions of pounds into this transition, and warned against shifting the goalposts. Several manufacturers have already committed to all-electric car lineups in 2030, including Ford, Jaguar Land Rover, Mini and Mercedes. Louise Haigh MP, Labour’s shadow transport secretary, said: The real threat to investment in our automotive industry is chaos created by Kemi Badenoch and her colleagues at a time when the sector is crying out for certainty. The transition to electric vehicles is essential to net zero, essential to economic growth, and essential to the future of our automotive industry. The Conservatives might be happy to delay and let our car industry stall, but Labour would back the sector all the way, with our plan to deliver 80,000 jobs and £30bn in growth by turbocharging the switch to electric vehicles. Nadine Dorries is failing to represent her constituents, Rishi Sunak has said in a rare attack on his senior Conservative colleague, who has refused to formally resign despite announcing her intention to do so almost two months ago. The prime minister criticised the former culture secretary, who has not spoken in the Commons for more than 12 months, saying “people deserve to have an MP that represents them, wherever they are”. Dorries announced on 9 June that she would “immediately” quit as MP for Mid Bedfordshire after she was denied a peerage in Boris Johnson’s resignation honours. But she is yet to formally tender her resignation, despite a council in her own constituency demanding she do so immediately as “residents desperately need effective representation now”. Sunak told an LBC call-in: “I think people deserve to have an MP that represents them, wherever they are. “It’s just making sure your MP is engaging with you, representing you, whether that’s speaking in parliament or being present in their constituencies doing surgeries, answering your letters. That’s the job of an MP and all MPs should be held to that standard.” Asked if that meant Dorries was failing her constituents, Sunak said: “Well, at the moment people aren’t being properly represented.” In a letter to Dorries last week, Flitwick town council said “concerns and frustration about the situation” had been raised at a recent meeting, and councillors wanted her to “immediately vacate” her seat to allow a byelection. Dorries’s delay is widely seen as an attempt to frustrate Sunak’s attempts to prepare to replace her, though she has endorsed the prospective Tory candidate Festus Akinbusoye for her seat. Dorries had claimed she was holding on to her role as MP while she investigated why she was denied a seat in the House of Lords.

The business secretary was discussing the automotive industry’s concerns about a rule to be introduced in January that will require manufacturers to ensure at least 22% of new sales in the UK are of emissions-free models, rising each year to reach 80% by 2030. A manufacturer will be fined £15,000 for every polluting car sold over the limit, unless it can buy in extra allowances from another company. A spokesperson for Badenoch told Politico: If major car companies employing thousands of people are saying that there’s a problem, then it’s her job to look at ways to ease that problem. Toyota has called the proposed production deadline “challenging” while Ford said the rule poses a “threat” to its business and investment plans. The zero-emissions vehicle mandate is part of a series of rules to phase out petrol and diesel engine cars in an attempt to reach the government’s legal target of making the UK a net zero carbon emitter by 2050. The UK ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars is due in 2030. However, there are widespread concerns over whether Britain has adequate infrastructure and capacity for the growth of electric vehicles. Read more here: The bosses behind Britain’s multibillion-pound clean energy rollout will gather in Downing Street to discuss the government’s plan for green economic growth later on Wednesday. Grant Shapps, the energy secretary, is expected to meet the leaders of energy companies including EDF, SSE, Shell and BP, which are poised to invest billions in low- and zero-carbon projects. Shapps will convene the summit at No 10 days after the prime minister ignited a row with green groups, opposition parties and the Conservative party’s backbench MPs over his plans for “maxing out” the North Sea’s reserves. Alongside the talks over the energy companies’ plans to invest more than £100bn in the UK economy, which could create jobs around the country, Shapps is expected to call on the firms to help the government boost the UK’s energy security. He is also expected to discuss plans to crack down on “disruptive protest groups” who may target critical energy infrastructure, according to a government statement. Shapps was forced to defend the government’s stance on North Sea drilling, before the energy summit, against criticism that the plans are incompatible with Britain’s plans to become a net zero economy. Read the full story here: Rishi Sunak has said he is confident he can win over his climate-conscious daughters with his argument that the UK can reach net zero while continuing to drill for oil and gas. The prime minister said his children are not “eco-zealots”, when asked how he would tell them that he is issuing hundreds of new oil and gas licences. Sunak told LBC Radio: I’ll explain it to them in exactly the way I have, and we have good chat around our table about all these things. We are going to get to net zero, that’s my commitment. But even when we’re there, we will still need fossil fuels. So is it better to have them from here at home, supporting people’s jobs, the economy, public services like the NHS, and being less reliant on Vladimir Putin? And by the way, fewer carbon emissions rather than shipping things to here from halfway around the world? I think those are all just sensible, practical reasons. So yes, that is the right thing to do. Asked if he is confident he can win over his daughters, Sunak said: I am, because I think on this topic, like most people they don’t approach it as some kind of ... they’re not eco-zealots. They actually, I think, are open to sensible, practical arguments. The UK should “not take any lectures from anybody” about its record on green policies, Rishi Sunak has said. It was put to the prime minister on LBC Radio that the UN chief has called countries increasing the production of fossil fuels “truly dangerous radicals”. Sunak replied: What I would say, not just to him but more generally, is let’s look at the record. Which G7 country out of the large countries of America, Italy, France, Germany, us, Canada, Japan – which of those countries has decarbonised fastest over the past years or decades? Which one? It’s the UK, right? So, we should not take any lectures from anybody about our record. Our record is fantastic. He said that on the question of granting new North Sea oil and gas licences: I 100% believe that what I’m doing is right. Rishi Sunak has faced heavy criticism from a junior doctor for insisting that striking doctors are to blame for record high NHS waiting lists. Olivia, an A&amp;E doctor, hit out at his “amazing” claim during a radio phone-in, telling him that staff were leaving the NHS in droves and reminding him that staff retention was the bedrock of patient safety. Sunak sought to argue that the wave of industrial action by NHS workers was behind the long delays patients are facing before getting treatment. But waiting times had already hit record highs when the unprecedented wave of strike action began with nurses walking out in December last year. Olivia, from Newcastle, who did not give her second name, told him live on LBC: I think it’s amazing we’re blaming the increase in waiting lists on doctors going on strike. You’re losing staff because we are undervalued and it’s not just doctors, it’s everyone, we’re all leaving. You’re the prime minister, you’re the government, your staff aren’t happy – that’s your fault. And ultimately that’s not good for patients because retaining staff is one of the bedrocks of making sure you have good patient safety. Sunak had argued junior doctors and consultants were to blame for not accepting pay deals like other medical staff have done. He said: That’s what’s causing the waiting lists to go up, I don’t think that’s right. I would say to them I’m very grateful and respectful of the incredible job you do but we all have a shared mission to bring the waiting lists down. Rishi Sunak, asked if asylum seekers will be housed on the Bibby Stockholm barge next week, told LBC’s Nick Ferrari: The Bibby Stockholm will be in operation as soon as it’s passed all the checks and regulations – as soon as possible – that’s the key thing. The prime minister highlighted the Illegal Migration Act before adding: We’re making a difference, I’m going to keep going on this ... I’m going to throw everything at it. Sunak said there was “an array of people that want me to fail”, which he said included Labour, criminal gangs and “dodgy lawyers”, who he said were a “subset, a minority, of lawyers”. He went on: There are lots of people who are lined up to try and stop me, but I’m going to keep going until we stop the boats. Housing asylum seekers on the Bibby Stockholm “floating prison” would be “inhumane” and risks “retraumatising” people who have escaped war zones and other “horrors”, the leader of a refugee charity has warned. Steve Smith, the chief executive of Care4Calais, also expressed his fear that the barge being prepared to accommodate more than 500 refugees at Portland, Dorset,was an “accident waiting to happen” because of insufficient fire safety on board, with the government putting money as a “higher priority than people’s lives”. Smith said that the charity was currently assisting 11 people who had received letters from the Home Office advising them that they would be moved to the vessel. The letter states: You are not being detained under immigration powers, and this is not detention accommodation. You are free to leave the site, but we would request that you sign in and out of the site when you leave and return, so we can assure your safety. It adds that facilities on board will include an on-site nurse, recreational space, voluntary sector activities, English classes, entertainment areas, a worship room, and private space for consultations and to make phone calls and wifi access. The government has said there is “no timeframe” for the arrival of the first refugees to the Bibby Stockholm while final safety checks are being carried out. Smith told the PA news agency: The obvious fire hazard of moving a large number of people across to the Bibby is clearly causing a delay. We know the Bibby barge was intended for 220 people, we know the intent is to put 506 residents aboard but, by the time you add security staff and other staff, that would come to 546. Now you have a barge with narrow corridors with three decks, with terms of crowding people in into what were originally single person rooms with two and in some of the larger rooms up to six, doubling those on board “If you’re on the far side of this barge and on the upper storey and there are only two fire escapes and that’s where you are when a fire breaks out, you can imagine the absolute chaos and pandemonium as panicked individuals crammed in narrow corridors try to get out. They are not able to escape on the water side and if they do, what if they can’t swim, jumping into the water without lifejackets. This is an absolute accident waiting to happen, it looks like the government is prepared to save money, making it a higher priority than people’s lives. Among those being supported by the charity are the survivors of torture, people with disabilities and people who have experienced trauma at sea. He said: Housing any human on a ‘floating prison’ like the Bibby Stockholm is unacceptable. Doing so to people like this is completely inhumane. Our concern in many cases, probably most cases, is that these will be individuals who have crossed the Channel in flimsy boats and they don’t do this for fun. They will have probably had a fairly terrifying journey from the place of origin which could be something like Afghanistan where, having survived the war, perhaps having fought on the side of British troops there. Individuals like that who have been through all these horrors have been through unwelcoming and sometimes hostile countries like the Balkans and Libya to get to Calais, sleeping rough, braving the Channel under really difficult circumstances and then to be put further on a boat, this has all the potential for re-traumatising. Smith said that speeding up the asylum process by prioritising those from high-risk countries such as Afghanistan and providing a safe passage system similar to that put into place for Ukraine would reduce the need for centres like the Bibby Stockholm. He said: What can we do? Speed up asylum claims process, clear the backlog, provide safe passage, allow people to start working and integrate better into the community and then concerns about it costing us £6m a day start to dissipate. Rishi Sunak has said Nadine Dorries’ constituents are not being properly represented as the Tory MP remains in the post despite saying she would resign. The prime minister told an LBC call-in: I think people deserve to have an MP that represents them wherever they are. It’s just making sure your MP is engaging with you, representing you, whether that’s speaking in parliament or being present in their constituencies doing surgeries, answering your letters. That’s the job of an MP and all MPs should be held to that standard. Asked if that meant Dorries was failing her constituents, Sunak said: Well, at the moment, people aren’t being properly represented. Rishi Sunak acknowledged NHS waiting lists in England have increased, but he opted to blame industrial action for the situation. After Nick Ferrari said the waiting list was 7.2 million when Sunak came into office, the prime minister added on LBC: Yeah, and now it’s 7.9 [million] give or take. But if you look at what happened Nick, I’ll just be totally honest with everybody, if you look at what happened we were actually making progress, we eliminated the number of two-year waiters – people waiting a really long time – we practically eliminated the number of people waiting one-and-a-half years, and we were making progress on bringing the overall numbers down. What happened? We had industrial action, we’ve got strikes. I’ve taken a very firm but fair point of view, we’ve accepted the recommendations from independent pay review bodies, I’m delighted that the nurses and a million other NHS workers have accepted the Government’s pay offer and they’re working really hard to deliver for patients, but unfortunately we still have groups of people who are not doing that and they’re striking – and that is the reason that the waiting lists are going up. It’s as simple as that. Not everyone agrees with that assessment. Critics say the increase in waiting lists is actually down to Tory mismanagement of the health service. The British Medical Association (BMA) – the union behind ongoing junior doctor and consultant strikes – previously pointed out that waiting lists have been rising for the past 13 years. A byelection to replace Margaret Ferrier will take place “as quickly as possible”, an SNP MP has said. Ferrier lost her seat on Tuesday after results of a recall petition in the Rutherglen and Hamilton West constituency was announced, with a new vote expected in the coming months to replace her. Brendan O’Hara, the SNP’s chief whip at Westminster, will now be tasked with filing a writ with the speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, to officially vacate the seat. Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland on Wednesday, the SNP MP David Linden said the party would seek a byelection “at the earliest possible point”. He said: The SNP chief whip Brendan O’Hara will move the writ the first week that parliament returns from summer recess – that’s the earliest possible point we can do it – and we aim to do that and ensure that we have that byelection as quickly as possible. Rishi Sunak has said inflation is not falling as fast as he would like, but said he believes people can “see light at the end of the tunnel”. The prime minister, appearing on LBC’s Nick Ferrari programme, said of his five priorities: “The most important one is inflation,” adding that he plans to halve inflation and said the government was making progress. Is that as fast as I’d like? No. Is it as fast as anyone would like? No. But the numbers most recently that we had show that we’re heading in the right direction, inflation is coming down, and I think people can see light at the end of the tunnel. But, look, we’ve got to stick to the plan, it’s not easy to bring down inflation. It requires me to make difficult but responsible decisions on behalf of the country. They’re not easy, I get flak for them, but I’m going to do them because they’re the right thing for everybody in the long-term, and I’m determined to stick to the course and bring down inflation for everyone. Grant Shapps has insisted that the Bibby Stockholm barge that will house asylum seekers is not a “deathtrap”. The first 50 people were due to be moved onto the 222-bedroom Bibby Stockholm in Portland, Dorset this week but a Home Office source confirmed that there would be further delays in the use of the barge until sign off from health and safety officials is obtained. The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) has said it is planning to write to the Home Office about overcrowding and access to fire exits on the vessel. Rishi Sunak is now under increasing pressure to explain why the government persists in planning to use the barge, which has been condemned by refugee organisations for being costly, cruel and inhumane. “As the only professional voice, firefighters believe the Bibby Stockholm to be a potential deathtrap,” FBU’s assistant general secretary, Ben Selby, told the Guardian. The barge has 222 cabins along narrow corridors over three decks, with two main exits. The evacuation point for those onboard is a compound on the quayside, which councillors have described as “completely inadequate” for about 550 people. Councillors who visited the barge last week were told there were no lifejackets onboard and have expressed concerns that locked gates could cause a crush in an emergency. The energy secretary, however, sought to refute the FBU’s warning, telling ITV’s Good Morning Britain: It certainly won’t be a deathtrap. This actual ship was previously used by Germany to house migrants, there’s no reason why it wouldn’t be absolutely safe. Ships are used to transport people all the time and there’s no inherent reason why that [not being safe] would be the case. That’s actually why these final safety checks are being carried out. Grant Shapps has said it would be “irresponsible” not to grant new oil and gas licences in the North Sea and insisted the UK will “still meet our net zero targets”. The energy security secretary told Times Radio that the North Sea basin was very mature and was “effectively running out”. He said: The IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] says that in order to meet the goals of 1.5% [degrees Celsius], no more than 1.5% warming, we would need to reduce by 4% a year the amount of oil and gas. We are, even with these licences, on a trajectory to reduce by 7% a year because we’re running out of oil and gas in the North Sea. So, you can see that having these licences is entirely compatible with and actually irresponsible not to grant them if we’re going to both secure the energy security of British homes and businesses, but also get to net zero. So, it’s a very sensible, rational thing for us to be doing. He told GB News that he was meeting with energy companies “who are going to invest £100bn in renewables” at No 10 today. He said: Everyone supports this country’s transition to net zero but we cannot get there by telling people ‘we’re simply going to stop using oil and gas’. The only way to do that would be to tell people ‘don’t put your gas boiler on, don’t drive a petrol car’, and do that almost instantaneously. Unless you do that, what you’re really saying is ‘we’re not going to dig our own oil and gas, we’ll import instead’. Yes, we’ll have more oil and gas licences, but we’ll still meet our net zero targets because we’re also massively investing in all these renewables as well. Shapps denied the government had not been doing anything to boost UK energy security. He said: We’ve been moving very fast. This is just the latest round of investment into renewables by some of the very biggest energy companies in the land. I will be looking after the politics blog today.

      "politics\/live\/2023\/jul\/27\/rishi-sunak-petrol-car-sale-ban-climate-crisis-net-zero-uk-politics-live Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, has dismissed as “desperate nonsense” a claim by Rishi Sunak that he has a poor record on building houses in London. (See 1.18pm and 2pm.) The Home Office’s “routine” housing of unaccompanied child asylum seekers in hotels is unlawful, the high court has ruled. The head of the private bank Coutts has resigned, less than 48 hours after the departure of his boss, the NatWest chief executive Alison Rose, saying he was taking “ultimate responsibility” for the “mishandling” of Nigel Farage’s bank accounts. Rishi Sunak has failed to give his backing to Sir Howard Davies, the embattled chair of NatWest Group, following the row over Nigel Farage’s bank account. Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary for climate and net zero, has dismissed reports suggesting the Labour leadership is divided over its support for net zero policy. There have been some reports suggestions that Miliband’s passion for green policies is not 100% shared by Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, who are more worried about the impact of measures that might raise costs for voters. But Miliband dismissed these reports in an interview on the World at One. He said: I am far too experienced to be worried about that kind of thing. Because the truth is you always get tittle-tattle in Westminster. The truth is that Keir Starmer is absolutely 100% committed to the project of clean energy by 2030, which is the way to cut bills and give us energy security and tackle the climate crisis. And he’s also absolutely committed, as is Rachel Reeves, to ramping up to £28bn a year of investment to bring the good jobs that we need for our country. And you know what? If Labour wins the election, we will never have had a prime minister and a chancellor so committed to this agenda and I’m incredibly proud to work alongside them. The Refugee Council has welcomed this morning’s high court ruling on unaccompanied child asylum seekers (see 11.28am) as a “landmark day for children’s rights”. The organisation’s chief executive, Enver Solomon, said: The court has confirmed that there can be no exceptions when the rights of vulnerable children are concerned. The government should do everything in its power to ensure these children are safe and in the care of local authorities. Nadine Dorries has been urged to honour her promise to resign as an MP by councillors in her Mid Bedfordshire constituency. Flitwick town council, which describes itself as having the largest concentration of voters of any town council in the constituency, has posted on its website an open letter to the MP saying she should quit. In the letter Stephanie Stanley, the town clerk, says: The last time you spoke in the Commons was 7 June 2022. You have not maintained a constituency office for a considerable time, and it’s widely understood that you have not held a surgery in Flitwick since March 2020. Rather than representing constituents, the council is concerned that your focus appears to have been firmly on your television show, upcoming book and political manoeuvres to embarrass the government for not appointing you to the House of Lords. Councillors noted that your behaviour widely reported in the press is not in line with the seven principles of public life set out by Lord Nolan in 1995 … Our residents desperately need effective representation now, and Flitwick town council calls on you to immediately vacate your seat to allow a byelection. The town council says it operates on a non-party political basis. Opposition parties in Scotland have strongly criticised Humza Yousaf for using Scottish government resources to publish a policy paper on citizenship policy in an independent Scotland. (See 10.25am.) Donald Cameron, the Scottish Conservatives’ constitution spokesperson, said: People across Scotland will be appalled that Humza Yousaf is focusing on yet another self-indulgent paper touting independence. It is the wrong priority at the worst possible time. This paper is not only a blatant misuse of public money and resources by the SNP, but it also demonstrates how out of touch they are with the public. Neil Bibby, Scottish Labour’s constitution spokesperson, said: Our NHS is in chaos and people are struggling to make ends meet during the worst cost of living crisis in decades – but as always the SNP-Green government is distracted by its constitutional obsession. Humza Yousaf is completely out of touch with Scotland’s priorities and bereft of new ideas. And the Scottish Lib Dem MSP Willie Rennie said the policy paper was “more therapy for Humza Yousaf and the nationalist movement than a serious attempt to persuade people to support their cause”. The number of permanent GPs in England has dropped year-on-year for 12 months in a row, PA Media reports. PA says: There were 26,521 permanent qualified GPs working in England in June 2023, down 1.3% from 26,859 in June 2022, according to figures from NHS Digital. It is the 12th consecutive month the number of family doctors has fallen year-on-year, suggesting the total is on a clear downward path. The latest drop of 1.3% comes after annual decreases of 1.4% in March, 1.5% in April and 1.3% in May. Prof Kamila Hawthorne, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said the figures show “the true extent of both the workforce and workload crises” GPs are facing. She said: Our teams have been working continuously under intense workload and workforce pressures in recent years, but the latest data shows just how serious these pressures have become. Nigel Farage has welcomed the resignation of Peter Flavel as Coutts CEO. (See 2.21pm.) Humza Yousaf, Scotland’s first minister, has said he will not expel a former minister from the SNP over terse criticism of the party’s policies, PA Media reports. PA says: Fergus Ewing has become a frequent opponent of Scottish government policy in recent months, including over plans to limit human activity in at least 10% of Scottish waters, the introduction of a deposit return scheme and the long-awaited dualling of the A9. Speaking on the Holyrood Sources podcast this week, Ewing said there was a “toxic” atmosphere within the SNP group at Holyrood, claiming some in senior positions within the party and in government had not spoken to him in “well over a year”. Asked by journalists on Thursday if the recent criticism could lead to Ewing’s expulsion, Yousaf said the former minister’s position in the party was safe. “People aren’t going to be expelled or punished for criticising me, or criticising the party’s direction on several positions,” he said. “We will always look to adhere to the standing orders that apply to me just as much as they apply to Fergus or Angus Brendan MacNeil.” Later asked if there was a “toxic” environment within the party, the first minister said “not in my experience”. He added: “There’s pretty robust debate, it’s fair to say.” Peter Flavel is stepping down as head of Coutts, Graeme Wearden reports on the business live blog. Flavel is the second senior figure from the NatWest group to lose their job over the row that erupted after Coutts closed Nigel Farage’s account. Dame Alison Rose, the NatWest chief executive, resigned yesterday. There are more details on Graeme’s business live blog. Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, has responded to Rishi Sunak’s attack on his housebuilding record (see 1.18pm) by accusing the PM of “desperate nonsense”. In a statement Khan said: This is pathetic gesture politics by the Tories in an attempt to distract from their out of touch government’s inaction on the mortgage crisis and Rishi Sunak’s failure to stand up to his own backbenchers on housebuilding. Londoners won’t be fooled in the slightest. The Tories have a miserable record of continually blocking badly needed new housing in London across the board while Labour in London has exceeded the government’s own affordable housing targets, delivered higher council home building than the rest of England combined and built more homes of any kind than since the 1930s. In a briefing note for journalists, Khan said that there were 25,658 “genuinely affordable” housing starts in London in 2022-23, a record high, and that 23,092 council homes had been started in London since 2018, which is the highest level of council home building since the 1970s. He also highlighted multiple ways in which he said the Tories were holding back building in the capital, including: ministers blocking new housing developments that would have delivered hundreds of homes; funding for affordable housing being cut and delayed; limits being imposed on the construction of tall buildings in London; the government failing to extend infrastructure in the capital. Rishi Sunak was visiting a housing development in west London today to promote an announcement from Downing Street that it is spending £200m on housing initiatives in the capital. In a news release, sent out to journalists but not yet on the No 10 website, Downing Street says the money will fund “densification” and brownfield regeneration in the capital. It says: A direct allocation of £150m for housebuilding to London boroughs, bypassing the Greater London authority – to unlock development by preparing brownfield land and supporting infrastructure like new roads and green spaces. Because of the mayor’s failure to deliver the number of homes required in London over his years in office, someone working in inner London can, on average, expect to pay 17 times their earnings to buy a home – a ratio more than double the national average. This is why the government needs to change the approach, working directly with other local leaders in the capital. Further government investment worth £53m to Old Oak West – a project that will deliver over 9,000 new homes, support 12,000 jobs, and transform the area neighbouring the £1.7bn Old Oak Common HS2 station. The news release is particularly critical of Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London. As well as suggesting that he is to blame for London property prices being so high, it says the government will be launching its own review into housebuilding in London because, it says, the target for 52,000 new homes per year in London’s housing plan is not being met. In a quote in the news release, Sunak says: The mayor has failed to deliver the homes that London needs. This has driven up house prices and made it harder for families to get on the housing ladder in the first place. That is why we are stepping in today to boost house building and make home ownership a reality again for people across this great city. The Tories have been criticising Khan’s record on housing for years. But normally government press releases are not as implicitly party political as this one, and this could be seen as fresh evidence that Sunak has decided to adopt a more “gloves off” approach to campaigning. (Making assessments on which party has the best record on housebuilding in London is famously complicated. This article, by Inside Housing’s Peter Apps, published during the Boris Johnson premiership, explains why.) In his pooled broadcast interview this morning Rishi Sunak claimed the government was taking “tough” action to stop banks closing people’s accounts on account of their views. He said: We have passed new laws to ensure banks do treat customers fairly and they are not discriminating against people because they are exercising their lawful right to free speech. And we’re making sure that people, if banks are going to take away their bank accounts, have an ability to challenge that and have those bank accounts re-instated through the ombudsman. So there’s tough action that the government has taken to make sure that banks are behaving in the right way. Rishi Sunak has failed to give his full backing to Sir Howard Davies, chairman of NatWest, in interviews this morning, PA Media reports. PA says that Sunak did not back calls for the resignation of Davies in a pooled interview this morning – but also that Sunak would not say whether he had confidence in him. Davies has been under pressure to quit because he and the NatWest board initially backed Dame Alison Rose on Tuesday, after she admitted being the source of the BBC story that wrongly said Nigel Farage’s political views were not a factor in the decision by Coutts to close his account. But late on Tuesday night, after the board realised that No 10 and the Treasury were pushing for resignation, there was a change of heart, and Rose quit. Farage has been calling for the entire NatWest board to be replaced. Asked about NatWest, Sunak said: What I said right at the start of this was that it wasn’t right for people to be deprived of basic services because of banking, because of their views. This isn’t about any one individual, it’s about values – do you believe in free speech and not to be discriminated against because of your legally held views? Do you believe in privacy, particularly on matters as sensitive as your financial information. Those are the values and questions at stake here and that’s why I said what I did. One of the stories that generated particular outrage about the practice of housing unaccompanied child asylum seekers in hotels was the Observer investigation in January saying dozens of youngsters had been kidnapped by gangs from a Brighton hotel run by the Home Office. In a statement welcoming today’s judgment, Bella Sankey, the Labour leader of Brighton and Hove city council, said: As a result of this policy, a dozen classrooms of children, including some of the most traumatised and vulnerable children in the world, have gone missing and, sickeningly for us, 50 children are still missing from the hotel used in Brighton and Hove. Importantly the high court also makes clear that the home secretary already has the power to require local authorities across the country to take children into foster care via a statutory rota system called the national transfer scheme. Suella Braverman must now urgently enforce this system so that the hotels can be emptied and all local authorities can play their part in safeguarding children. Brighton and Hove council was a party in the case, joining Every Child Protected Against Trafficking in challenging the legality of the Home Office’s policy. Sankey said she was proud the council had played a part in ensuring “all children in need of care can in future be properly safeguarded, irrespective of their nationality and immigration status”. Here are extracts, via PA Media, from Mr Justice Chamberlain judgment at the high court saying the Home Office’s “routine” use of hotel accommodation for unaccompanied child asylum seekers is unlawful. He said: Ensuring the safety and welfare of children with no adult to look after them is among the most fundamental duties of any civilised state … The home secretary has been accommodating children in hotels for over two years. It may be that, in June and July 2021, the home secretary could plausibly have contended that the commissioning of hotels was intended and functioning an emergency measure. It is much more difficult to make that case after September 2021, when she agreed the Kent protocol, which formalised the cap on the numbers of unaccompanied asylum seeking children that Kent county council would accept, against a common understanding that any unaccompanied asylum seeking children children who arrived when the cap had been reached would be accommodated by the home secretary in hotels. She and Kent county council may well have hoped that it would not be necessary to use hotels, but it rapidly became clear that this intention was not being realised. The judge also found that Kent county council is acting unlawfully in failing to accommodate and look after unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. He said: In ceasing to accept responsibility for some newly arriving unaccompanied asylum seeking children, while continuing to accept other children into its care, Kent county council chose to treat some unaccompanied asylum seeking children differently from and less favourably than other children, because of their status as asylum seekers. Every Child Protected Against Trafficking (Ecpat) has strongly welcomed the high court ruling this morning saying the “routine” use of hotel accommodation for unaccompanied child asylum seekers is unlawful. Explaining the significance of the judgment, Patricia Durr, Ecpat’s CEO, said in a statement: This judgment powerfully reaffirms the primacy of the Children Act 1989 and our child welfare statutory framework which does not allow for children to treated differently because of their immigration status. It remains a child protection scandal that so many of the most vulnerable children remain missing at risk of significant harm as a consequence of these unlawful actions by the secretary of state and Kent county council. Despite the recent passing of the Illegal Migration Act 2023, which will deny unaccompanied children the right to claim asylum, amongst other hugely damaging provisions, this judgment serves as a clear and timely reminder that neither central nor local government departments can depart from the statutory child welfare framework and the duties towards all children under the Children Act 1989. We will continue to defend the rights of every child in the UK to live free from exploitation and access the care they are entitled to under the law. The Home Office’s “routine” housing of unaccompanied child asylum seekers in hotels is unlawful, the high court has ruled. According to PA Media, the charity Every Child Protected Against Trafficking (Ecpat) brought legal action against the Home Office over the practice of housing unaccompanied youngsters in Home Office hotels, claiming the arrangements are “not fit for purpose”. In a ruling this morning, Mr Justice Chamberlain said the use of hotels for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children had become unlawful, as the power to place the children in hotels “may be used on very short periods in true emergency situations”. He told the court in London: It cannot be used systematically or routinely in circumstances where it is intended, or functions in practice, as a substitute for local authority care. From December 2021 at the latest, the practice of accommodating children in hotels, outside local authority care, was both systematic and routine and had become an established part of the procedure for dealing with unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. From that point on, the home secretary’s provision of hotel accommodation for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children exceeded the proper limits of her powers and was unlawful. There is a range of options open to the home secretary to ensure that unaccompanied asylum-seeking children are accommodated and looked after as envisaged by parliament. It is for her to decide how to do so. Ecpat’s challenge was heard in London alongside similar claims brought by Brighton and Hove city council and Kent county council against the department, PA reports. It says the Home Office and Department for Education had opposed the legal challenges and said that the hotel use was lawful but was “deployed effectively as a ‘safety net’ and as a matter of necessity”. The government’s failure to bring down the level of school absences could lead to “a moral and social failure of epic proportions”, Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, said today. He made the comment in a foreword to a report by the Centre for Social Justice, the thinktank he chairs, saying that “crisis levels” of absence in schools in England are becoming entrenched. The problem became a lot worse during the pandemic, and absence levels have never returned to pre-Covid levels. The CSJ, which has been monitoring this problem since 2021, says steps taken by the Department for Education to increase attendance figures have been inadequate. According to the CSJ’s latest report, in autumn 2022 1.7 million children were persistently absent from school – defined as missing 10% or more of possible sessions. That was equivalent to 24.2% of all children in England, and it was an 84% increase on the pre-Covid figure for autumn 2019 (13.1%). And the report says 125,222 children were severely absent in autumn 2022 – defined as missing 50% or more of possible sessions. That was 1.7% of all children – a 108% increase on the figure for autumn 2019 (60,244 pupils) and the highest figure on record for an autumn term. Commenting on the figures, Duncan Smith said in his foreword to the report: The government risks creating a lost generation if it doesn’t act urgently to return so called ‘ghost children’ to the classroom. This would be a moral and social failure of epic proportions, creating a bow wave of problems for decades to come. Duncan Smith said school absences would make the attainment gap worse. He explained: It is a sad but unsurprising fact that among these children, the vulnerable are over represented. In the 2021\/22 academic year, the rate of severe absence among children in receipt of free school meals was more than three times than among their higher income peers, while children in receipt of SEN [special educational needs] support were three times more likely to be severely absent. The CSJ’s recent inquiry identified anxiety, poor mental health, disadvantage and SEN needs as key drivers of school absence – as well as changing parental attitudes to school since lockdown forced millions out of the classroom. This attendance gap will serve only to exacerbate the ‘attainment gap’ between poorer and more affluent children, already at its widest level in a decade. The DfE has been taking measures to bring down school absences, including piloting attendance monitors. But Duncan Smith said “existing measures fail to match the scale of the crisis”. UPDATE: Responding to the report, a Department for Education spokesperson said: We are also working with schools, trusts, governing bodies and local authorities to identify pupils who are at risk of becoming - or who are - persistently absent to support those children to return to regular and consistent education. The DfE has published more details of what it is doing to reduce school absences in a blog here. Scotland would adopt a citizenship model similar to that of Ireland if it ever becomes independent, Humza Yousaf, the first minister, has announced. PA News reports: Yousaf has published the fifth paper in a series laying out the prospectus for Scotland after separation, focusing on immigration and citizenship. The Scottish government has long advocated increased immigration to cope with an ageing population, with former first minister Nicola Sturgeon publishing plans for a separate Scottish visa in 2020, which was almost immediately rejected by Westminster. Yousaf said that anyone with a parent born in Scotland would be able to apply for Scottish citizenship if the country leaves the UK. The paper explains the rights of British nationals to claim dual citizenship, as well as how the process for foreign nationals to apply will be streamlined. Yousaf said: “I am in no doubt that alongside the climate crisis, the challenges of an ageing population are one of the biggest issues future generations will face in Scotland, unless action is taken today. “The Scottish government wants to make it easier for people, including those seeking to reconnect with family roots, to gain citizenship and contribute to our economy, society and public services like the NHS.” No 10 should bring in new fines for ex-ministers who break the rules on lobbying in time for Rishi Sunak’s next reshuffle and tighten restrictions on former civil servants, Eric Pickles, the head of the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), has said. Rowena Mason has the story here. Rishi Sunak has been urged to close the holes in his “Swiss cheese” of a windfall tax on energy companies after Shell and British Gas reported significant profits, with Labour calling the government’s stance “perverse”, Aubrey Allegretti reports. Good morning. A good way to think about the most important stories of our time is to imagine, if someone were to produce a news bulletin about what happened in the 21st century, what would be in it. Newspapers cover the most important stories of the last 24 hours. Live blogs, like this one, cover the most important stories of the last 24 minutes. But the story of the 21st century is obviously, obviously, the climate crisis, and this does feature in the daily news agenda too. This morning Chris Stark, chief executive of the Climate Change Committee, was on the Today programme and he was withering about the government’s backsliding on green issues (partly a matter of rhetoric, but there have been some policy shifts too) since the Uxbridge byelection result last week, which persuaded some Tories that fighting net zero measures could be an election. winning strategy. Stark was particularly critical of the government’s failure to categorically reaffirm its commitment to banning the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030. This was “crackers”, he said. He was referring to the days of mixed messaging. According to the Daily Mirror, the government produced five positions on this issue within 24 hours. John Stevens, the Mirror’s political editor, summed them up here. Here are the main points from Stark’s interview. Stark said that there had been a “remarkable softening” in support for climate policies in recent days, and that this was a worry. He said: It’s a worrying situation. As somebody who works on climate issues, climate policies, we’ve seen this week a remarkable softening of the stance and the rhetoric from our political leaders on climate, in a period when frankly, we should be seeing the opposite. He seemed to be referring mostly to the government, but he may have had Labour in mind too. He said that, although Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, said in an interview on the Today programme on Tuesday that the government was fully committed to implementing the ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, by then the damage had been done. He said: I was very reassured by what Michael Gove said when he sat in this chair. But, nonetheless, the damage was done because we had this discussion following Uxbridge result about whether the 2030 goal was the right one for the country. That’s one of the things I’m very worried about, because we’ve just heard the the environmental case for having a net zero target …. My own belief is that if you don’t make the economic case for it alongside that, then then we will really struggle in this mission towards net zero. Stark said it was “crackers” to allow people to think the 2030 deadline might slip. The government was trying to promote investment in the electric car industry, he said. He went on: So it’s crackers, frankly, to invest £500m pounds in bringing Jaguar Land Rover to the UK to invest in a new gigafactory for making the batteries for those cars, and then similarly, almost within almost the same week, start to talk about softening that 2030 goal, removing the market for the vehicles that Jaguar Land Rover want to make. And he said the government was not making enough progress towards its net zero targets. He explained: The progress we’re making in this country against the targets that are set in law is just not fast enough. Let me give you one illustration of that. If you removed from the equation the one sector where we have been doing pretty well in this country, which is the power sector – we are moving towards a more renewable, cleaner electricity system – if you take that out of the equation and look at all the other sectors where of course the challenge now lies, decarbonizing our economy, moving towards a score of net zero, the average in recent years has been about a 1% fall in greenhouse gas emissions. If we’re going to meet the 2030 goal that the government set in that Cop26 process back in Glasgow, that needs to quadruple over the next six or seven years. Now we are not seeing that kind of progress and the government’s plans. It looks like a quiet day in politics, and there isn’t much in the diary.

      "politics\/live\/2023\/jul\/25\/michael-gove-petrol-cars-mps-rishi-sunak-climate-policy-uk-politics-live-latest-updates Rishi Sunak has been called “desperate and pathetic” by a member of the shadow cabinet after posting a message on Twitter saying Labour is on the side of “criminal gangs” because of its stance on the Illegal Immigration Act. (See 3.45pm.) More criticism came from Emily Thornberry, the shadow attorney general, who said Sunak was demeaning his office. Usually, I try and maintain some sense of respect for the office of the Prime Minister, but it’s just impossible when the man doing the job is willing to demean it like this. What a desperate attempt to deflect from his own dismal failures. Utterly pathetic. Britain’s plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030 are “immovable” but it is time to review proposals for homeowners to replace gas boilers with heat pumps, Michael Gove has said. The number of households in temporary accommodation in England is at its highest since records began as charities call on “out of touch” government to ban no-fault evictions and accelerate social housebuilding. Wildfires in Rhodes are a “wake-up call” on the effects of the climate crisis, a UK government minister has said, as empty planes were sent to the Greek island to help bring home stranded Britons. Rishi Sunak’s latest attack on Labour (see 3.45pm) is unlikely to work, according to two public opinion experts. Keiran Pedley from the polling firm Ipsos says that, although voters care about immigration, they don’t trust the Tories to deal with the issue. This tweet understates the extent of the problem for Sunak. It is not just that voters think the government is doing a bad job on small boats; they think Labour would do better. And Luke Tryl from More in Common, the group campaigning for inclusivity – which commissions a lot of public opinion research – says that people will see that the Sunak tweet is unfair, and that it will come across as inauthentic too. Journalists and commentators at the liberal end of the market are outraged by Rishi Sunak’s tweet associating Labour with “criminal gangs”. (See 3.45pm.) Here are some of their comments. From Steve Richards, the writer and broadcaster From Sonia Sodha, the Observer’s chief leader writer From Prospect’s Sam Freedman From LBC’s Sangita Myska From Robin Lustig, the former BBC presenter From Oliver Kamm, the writer and former Times leader writer The Labour MP Chris Bryant has accused Rishi Sunak of debasing the office of prime minister with his tweet associating Labour with criminal gangs. (See 3.45pm.) A shadow cabinet minister has accused Rishi Sunak of descending into the “gutter” after the PM posted a message on Twitter associating the Labour party with “criminal gangs” and corrupt lawyers. Sunak posted the message via his party political account, claiming that all three groups were obstructing government plans to stop migrants crossing the Channel in small boats. (See 1.16pm.) He was promoting a Daily Mail report about lawyers helping people claim asylum on the basis of evidence they knew to be false. This is what we’re up against. The Labour party, a subset of lawyers, criminal gangs - they’re all on the same side, propping up a system of exploitation that profits from getting people to the UK illegally. I have a plan to stop it. In response, Jim McMahon posted a message on Twitter saying Sunak was being “desperate and pathetic”. When all else is lost, the only place you have is the gutter. Poor yes. Desperate and pathetic from Sunak too. McMahon was commenting on a tweet from Iain Dale, the broadcaster who worked as a Tory adviser many years ago. Dale described the Sunak tweet as “pretty desperate stuff”. While the Sunak smear was unusual, because prime ministerial tweets are normally more restrained, it was not unprecedented. At PMQs in April Sunak claimed Labour was going to “side with the people smugglers” when it voted against the illegal migration bill. Sunak issued his tweet linking Labour with “criminal gangs” following reports saying he has been persuaded that he needs to campaign more aggressively if he wants to win the next election. In a report in the Sunday Times at the weekend Tim Shipman and Harry Yorke said: Sunak’s is not a leaky Downing Street where officials routinely talk out of turn, but conversations with several of those close to the prime minister suggest that it has taken several weeks of intense persuasion to convince him that just turning up and doing the job competently will not be enough to win the general election. They now say he is fired up and keen to go “gloves off” against Labour, drawing starker dividing lines with the opposition and offering bolder policy to voters who are crying out for some hope. Sunak told his MPs on Wednesday: “In the coming months, I am going to set out more of what I would do if I had a full term. I was recently described as a full-spectrum modern Conservative and you are going to see that in the programme I lay out. You are going to see that I am committed to providing people with both security and opportunity.” The Sunak tweet is a smear because it associates Labour with criminal gangs, on the grounds that Labour is opposed to the Illegal Migration Act, when there are perfectly legitimate grounds for opposing it. Other groups who have criticised it just as strongly include the Law Society, the UNHCR and the Church of England. But Labour has also been willing to use unfounded smears in its own campaigning. In April it posted a message on Twitter claiming that Sunak does not believe adults convicted of sexually assaulting children should go to prison. Labour MPs defended the campaign, on the grounds that it was highlighting flaws with the justice system (prison overcrowding leading to the courts issuing lighter sentences). But there were also claims that the advert was misleading, and no Labour MP seriously tried to argue that Sunak thinks the sexual assault of a child is something that doesn’t generally deserves a jail sentence. The UK government has added its voice to international concerns about the situation in Israel, amid mass protests against plans by the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to overhaul the country’s judicial system, PA Media reports. In a statement today, the Foreign Office said: As the prime minister discussed with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this year, the UK’s strong relationship with Israel has always been underpinned by our shared democratic values. While Israel’s exact constitutional arrangements are a matter for Israelis, we urge the Israeli government to build consensus and avoid division, ensuring that a robust system of checks and balances and the independence of Israel’s judiciary are preserved. Trudy Harrison, 47, an environment minister, has announced she is standing down at the next election. She represents Copeland, but it is being replaced by a new constituency with different boundaries and she said she would not apply to fight that seat because it would not cover where she lived. “Essentially I am a community activist at home and I want to come home and make sure the policies that I have been involved in shaping and making actually reap benefits for people in west Cumbria,” she told ITV. Harrison won Copeland from Labour in a byelection in February 2017. The seat had been Labour since it was created in 1983, and the win may have helped to persuade Theresa May to call a snap general election soon afterwards. On the basis of this tally, Harrison is now the 43rd Tory MP to say they will be standing down. Labour has suggested the government should “rethink” the advice it is providing for people considering travelling to the Greek island of Rhodes. The Foreign Office is not telling holidaymakers to avoid travelling to Rhodes – although its travel advice does urge people to contact their travel company if they are due to go to an area affected by the wildfires. Speaking during a private notice question in the Lords, where it is the last sitting day before the summer recess, Lady Smith, the Labour leader in the Lords, said the lack of advice from the Foreign Office was “not helpful”. She said: When the minister [Andrew Mitchell] at the [Foreign Office] is asked if he would go to Rhodes on holiday he admitted he wouldn’t travel there. And yet the government’s advisory is not helpful – or lack of advisory – to those who are not sure if they should fly this week or not, or what the financial consequences could be. Smith said the government should reconsider what it is saying to Rhodes. She suggested that, without advice from the Foreign Office telling people to stay away, it could be harder for people to claim compensation for a cancelled holiday. The Earl of Courtown, the deputy chief whip in the Lords replying on behalf of the government, said the government’s travel advice was being kept under constant review. He also said that the situation in Rhodes was stabilising, and that the “vast majority” of the island was not affected by the fires. On compensation, he said the official advice “should not impact people’s ability to claim insurance for things like cancelled hotel bookings or flight changes, depending on their policy and level of cover”. The government is not trying to kick compensation payments for victims impacted by the infected blood scandal into the “long grass”, Jeremy Quin, the Cabinet Office minister, has said. As PA Media reports, Quin told the official inquiry this morning he was determined to set out “redress” amid anger that the delays may be because compensation is deemed too expensive and complicated. PA says: The minister insisted there is a “determination to get this resolved” and confirmed he will await the inquiry’s final report, expected in the autumn, before announcing a plan. The infected blood inquiry was set up in 2017 to investigate the infection of thousands of patients with HIV and hepatitis C via contaminated blood products in the 1970s and 1980s. Around 2,900 people died in what has been described as the worst treatment disaster in the history of the NHS. Quin said he was “aware of the number of people who are dying” while awaiting full payments after an initial scheme of interim payments was set out. He acknowledged there is a “moral case here for compensation to be paid” but said “no decisions have been taken” on the full scheme. He added: “I’ve got no doubt that compensation will be paid. The form and shape of that compensation are decisions that have to be made.” This morning the Daily Mail has splashed on the findings of an investigation by undercover reporters who found law firms willing to submit claims for asylum using evidence they knew to be bogus on behalf of someone posing as an “economic migrant”. In their story, Tom Kelly and Izzy Lyons report: Lawyers are charging thousands of pounds to submit false asylum and human rights claims for illegal immigrants. Staff at solicitors’ firms readily agreed to help an undercover Mail reporter posing as an economic migrant get refugee status. This was despite being told he had no legitimate reason to stay in the UK after arriving on a small boat. The investigation focuses on three cases involving two lawyers, and one legal adviser who, the paper says, were happy to help concoct a fake story for a client that might enable them to successfully claim asylum. They were charging between £4,000 and £10,000 for the service, the Mail says. But the Mail also claims these were not isolated cases. It says: Our investigation discovered widespread and blatant abuse of the rules by lawyers and legal representatives at registered solicitors’ firms. In most cases they suggested our journalist, who was originally from the Punjab, should pretend to be a supporter of a Sikh separatist movement banned in India – giving him grounds for asylum. In February, Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, told MPs that “a small number of legal practitioners” were being monitored by the Home Office on suspicion that they were helping people submit false asylum claims. The Mail report appears to vindicate these claims. This morning Rishi Sunak tweeted a link to the Daily Mail story from his party political Twitter account. He also claimed the story showed how “the Labour party, a subset of lawyers [and] criminal gangs” were all opposed to government policy on small boats. This is what we’re up against. The Labour party, a subset of lawyers, criminal gangs – they’re all on the same side, propping up a system of exploitation that profits from getting people to the UK illegally. I have a plan to stop it. Lord Evans, chair of the committee on standards in public life, has complained that the government has not done enough to stop foreign money being used to fund political parties in Britain. In an interview with Sky News, Evans said the rules intended to stop parties getting funding from foreign donors, companies or governments were “not rigorous” and “insufficiently transparent”. Parties are only allowed to accept money from permissible donors – broadly people registered to vote in the UK, or companies registered in Britain. But companies that donate don’t have to prove that they generated profits in the UK, and there are concerns that this loophole allows foreign donations to fund British politics indirectly. In a report two years ago Evans’ committee called for the rules to to be tightened to prevent this. The government has ignored these recommendations. Evans, a former head of MI5, told Sky News: We have been assured, and this has been said repeatedly by the government, that the rules are strict and rigorous. That’s not our view. The rules are not strict. They are not rigorous and they are insufficiently transparent … The first problem is lack of real openness. And just to say: ‘I have been given money by company X’, when you can’t work out where company X got that money from [and] who actually controls that company, is really not a satisfactory way of discharging responsibility for openness. And it’s also very important that we can protect the political system from an improper influence, whether that’s from business interests, whether that’s from extreme political interests, or whether that’s from foreign powers. And transparency is a really important part of that. And the transparency rules at the moment, in our view, the view of my committee are not strong enough. In his interview Evans also called for some limit on the amount of time MPs can spend on a second job. He said: There have been some quite well-documented cases where it’s hard to argue that this person is putting their main focus on their parliamentary duties, given the amount of time that they appear to be giving to other activities. Labour should counter “absolutely unacceptable” and “ignorant” Conservative attacks on its climate policies by offering a cross-party consensus on climate action, to bring forward measures this parliament to meet net zero, the outgoing chair of the Climate Change Committee has urged. As Fiona Harvey reports, Lord Deben, a former Tory environment secretary and minister under Margaret Thatcher and John Major, strongly criticised Grant Shapps and Suella Braverman, cabinet ministers who have led vitriolic attacks on Labour as “the political wing of Just Stop Oil”. He called on the government instead to heed the message of climate protesters. The full story is here. People who rent accommodation could end up paying £1.4bn more in energy bills because the government is planning to give landlords more time to comply with new energy efficiency standards, an energy thinktank has claimed. In his interview with the Sunday Telegraph at the weekend Michael Gove said landlords were being asked to do “too much too quickly”. He went on: We do want to move towards greater energy efficiency, but just at this point, when landlords face so much, I think that we should relax the pace that’s been set for people in the private rented sector, particularly because many of them are currently facing a big capital outlay in order to improve that efficiency. According to the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), Gove was referring to minimum energy efficiency standards for landlords. Currently they only need a band E energy performance certificate (EPC) for a property to be let, but the plan is for them to need a band C certificate (requiring better energy efficiency) for new tenancies from 2025, and all tenancies from 2028. There have already been reports saying the band C deadline for new tenancies will be put back to 2028. The ECIU says that there are more than 2.4m homes in England that fall below the EPC band C standard. It says that, if the deadline for them meeting this were put back to 2030, tenants could end up paying £1.4bn in fuel bills, on a “medium” assumption as to what will happen to gas prices. The thinktank also says that delaying the introduction of the new rules for all tenancies could create a “cliff edge”, with landlords all trying to get better insulation fitted just ahead of the deadline, with the risk that supplies won’t be able to meet the demand. Jess Ralston, an energy analyst at the ECIU, said: The government looks to be taking the side of landlords over the millions who’ve been stuck in cold, rental accommodation during a gas crisis that’s forced them to shell out hundreds on gas bills to try to keep warm. The main culprit here is the government – consulting on the changes in 2021 yet still not doing anything about this problem, even during a gas crisis, seems frankly irresponsible. This is a net zero policy that would save ordinary people who rent money on bills, and could have been phased in gradually so landlords carry out the work over several years. The UK was hit hard by the gas crisis because of failure to get on with simple common sense measures like these, and we’ll end up more dependent on foreign gas imports because of it. As the OBR has pointed out recently a failure to shift away from volatile gas prices could add 13% of GDP onto our national debt. The first set of minimum energy efficiency standards in 2018 made no significant difference to the number of rental properties available, with the sector actually increasing by over 150,000 since 2021. So the landlord lobby may claim that they’ll go packing but the evidence points to the contrary. Michael Gove has been accused of showing how “disjointed” the government’s net zero strategy is by Greenpeace UK. In a statement released after Gove’s media interview round this morning, in which the levelling up secretary appeared to firm up the government’s commitment to at least one green target, while signalling that others might be relaxed (see 10.04am), Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK’s director of policy, said: Michael Gove has demonstrated how disjointed the government’s new strategy is. If ministers genuinely want to help lower costs for households, they should be doing everything in their power to switch our homes, energy and transport systems away from expensive, climate-wrecking fossil fuels and run them instead on clean technology and cheap renewables. Mr Gove is right to reaffirm the government’s commitment to ending the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles from 2030 – and Sunak should now do the same, whilst making the transition as easy as possible for people with extensive charging infrastructure and the promised mandate on manufacturers. But allowing more oil and gas drilling, delaying the phase-out of gas boilers and giving landlords longer to insulate the homes of renters will only keep bills high and continue to fan the flames of climate change. Rishi Sunak may be emboldened by narrowly clinging onto Uxbridge by less than 500 votes, but as Greece continues to burn, putting climate policies on the chopping block right now will firmly place himself and his premiership on the wrong side of history. Rishi Sunak has told Volodymyr Zelenskiy he is appalled by the recent Russian attack on Odesa. Downing Street said the PM expressed his horror when he spoke to the Ukrainian president this morning. In a readout of the call No 10 said: The leaders discussed recent developments on the battlefield and the continued progress by Ukrainian forces despite the challenging conditions. The prime minister added that he was appalled by the devastation caused by recent Russian attacks on Odesa. Discussing the Black Sea grain initiative, the leaders agreed on the importance of ensuring grain was able to be exported from Ukraine to reach international markets. The prime minister said the UK was working closely with Turkey on restoring the grain deal, and we would continue to use our role as chair of the UN security council to further condemn Russia’s behaviour. Russia was increasingly looking to target merchant vessels in the Black Sea area and the UK was carefully monitoring the situation alongside our partners, the prime minister added. The UK continued to support Ukraine’s air defence and artillery needs with more ammunition and missiles being delivered, the prime minister said. The Labour MP Rosie Duffield has welcomed her party’s new plans for reform of the law allowing transgender people to transition. Anneliese Dodds, the Labour chair and shadow minister for women and equalities, set out the new position in an article for the Guardian. As Aubrey Allegretti reports, Labour is still committed to reforming the Gender Recognition Act but, influenced by the Scottish government’s unsuccessful attempt to change the law in Scotland (the UK government blocked the Scottish bill), it is not proposing to allow self-declaration and people wanting a gender recognition certificate will still require a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria. This amounts to a weaker reform than Labour was proposing in its 2019 manifesto, which backed self-declaration (or self-ID) for trans people. Keir Starmer reaffirmed the commitment to self-ID for trans people in 2021. The Conservatives have also retreated on this agenda. When Theresa May was PM, they were in favour of self-ID, but recently ministers strongly attacked the SNP over their self-ID plans. Stonewall, the group campaigning for LGBTQ+ rights, has criticised Labour’s policy. In a statement released yesterday it said: International leading practice has moved to a model based on legal self-determination. That is because it is inhumane and undignified to make trans people obtain a medical diagnosis to obtain legal gender recognition. An ever-growing number of countries have moved to, or are moving to, this model over the last fifteen years. In 2019, the World Health Organization de-classified being trans as a mental health disorder. If any political party wants to get the UK back on track for LGBTQ+ rights, they need to lean in to international evidence, experience and best practice. Speak to Ireland, speak to Belgium, speak to New Zealand, Switzerland, Denmark, large parts of Canada, US and Australia. Review the evidence – which finds no known cases of fraudulent or criminal intent. They need to understand how legal gender recognition with a de-medicalised model is working in practice before formulating the detail of their policy. But this morning Duffield, who as a gender critical feminist believes the extension of trans rights could undermine safeguards for biological woman and who has repeatedly criticised her party for its stance on trans issues, said Labour was now “going in the right direction”. She told the Today programme: It looks broadly speaking as though they’re going in the right direction, and basically have just agreed with myself and other feminist activists and women’s groups, with what we’ve been saying for the last few years. It’s good to get a bit of clarity. Duffield said she would like to see more detail of what Labour is proposing. But she said she was very glad the party is no longer committed to allowing people to change gender just through self-declaration. She said: That is the core thing that feminists on my side of the argument wanted to stop. I’m really glad that that has been announced very clearly. Rishi Sunak has insisted that the government’s approach to housing, set out most recently in a major speech by Michael Gove yesterday, is not protectionist. Writing in the Times, he says: Meeting our one million homes target is just a stepping stone. To support more families to form and grow we need to continue with our plan to keep building. But this is not about uncontrolled development of the countryside. It is not just about more homes of any kind, anywhere, no matter what communities think. Homes must be built in the right places, where it makes sense. Communities must have a say … Our approach is not protectionist, it’s targeted. More homes in the places where people want and need them. The number of households in temporary accommodation in England is at the highest level since records began 25 years ago, PA Media reports. PA says: As of 31 March this year, 104,510 households were in temporary accommodation, up 10% from the same point last year, according to homelessness statistics released by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. Compared with the previous quarter, the number of households in temporary accommodation increased by 4%. This latest figure surpasses a previous high of 101,300 reached in 2004, and is the highest among all the government figures available since 1998. Here are the main quotes from Michael Gove in his morning interviews on net zero issues. Gove, the levelling up secretary, called for a review of the proposed timetable for the replacement of gas boilers with heat pumps. Under the proposals, the installation of gas boilers in newly-built homes is meant to stop from 2025, and all gas boiler installation is meant to stop in homes from 2035. But Gove said the timetable needed to be reviewed. He told Times Radio: That is one area where I do think we need to review. It is important that new homes meet net-zero challenges but one of the challenges we have is with our existing housing stock. There are proposals to decarbonise our existing housing stock which I think are the right direction to go but I think the cost of some of those changes may impose on homeowners, and indeed on landlords, I think at this point in time we do need to be careful about imposing. Because we are living in a real cost-of-living challenge and what we don’t want to do is to force individuals to pay excessive sums at this stage, we need to take a proportionate approach. But he said 2030 was immovable as the date when the sale of new petrol and diesel cars would stop. When he was asked if this date was “immovable”, he replied: Yes. We’re committed to maintaining our policy of ensuring that by 2030 there are no new petrol and diesel cars being sold. I’m sure there are some people who would like to change that policy, I understand. But that policy remains. He said the government had to avoid a backlash against net zero measures. He told Times Radio: It’s important that the government does press ahead with appropriate and thoughtful steps in order to safeguard the environment but there are some specific areas where the cost that is being imposed on individuals risks creating a backlash. We don’t want to get to a situation where the support for improving our environment curdles and turns into resistance. And he told Sky News: We saw recently in the Netherlands that an inflexible approach to environmental rules actually led to a backlash and it now has a significant body of people who are unhappy about the steps being taken. It is still safe for tourists to travel to Rhodes in line with UK government advice, Michael Gove has said. The levelling up secretary added that he was planning to holiday on another Greek island himself next week. Ben Quinn has the story here. This is from the Times’s Matt Chorley on what he thinks the government may be up to with its net zero messaging. Good morning. Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, has been giving interviews this morning and talking, among other things, about the government’s approach to net zero policies. He was quite specific on a couple of points, but to say that he cleared things up would be going too far. Over the last few days, in government pronouncements on this topic, there has been more ambiguity than in a modernist poem. All of this has been quite good for those of us paid to report what the government is saying and explain what it means. But for producers trying to plan on the basis of what government rules will be for cars and boilers etc over the next decade, the uncertainty has been less welcome. To recap: a significant number of Tory MPs, and rightwing papers, have always opposed net zero measures that will impose costs on consumers and on Friday their hand was strengthened after the Conservatives unexpectedly won the Uxbridge and South Ruislip byelection, almost certainly because of a backlash about the extension of Ulez. That led to media reports on Saturday saying the government was rethinking its support for green measures, and a day later the Sunday Telegraph splashed on an interview with Gove headlined: “Gove: net zero can’t become a crusade.” On Monday, when Rishi Sunak was asked in an interview if he was still committed to stopping the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, he gave a reply best summarised by Politico, which said he sounded “a bit U-turnish on some of his net zero plans”. At the lobby briefing an hour or so later the PM’s spokesperson said the government was, in fact, committed to the petrol\/diesel new car ban from 2030. But separate briefing implied this was one of several measures that could be subject to review. This morning Gove said that 2030 was “immovable” as the date when the ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars would take effect. But he did say that government proposals for gas boilers to be banned from newly built homes from 2025, with all gas boiler installation phased out from 2035, could be reviewed. I will post more from his interviews shortly. Did that help? On gas boilers, probably. But on petrol and diesel cars? Gove has form for confidently asserting things on the Today programme that turn out not to be the case – during Brexit he insisted a key vote would definitely go ahead on hours before it was shelved – and so you might think twice before making a car factory investment on the basis of a Gove comment in a radio interview. Gove was speaking as a group of MPs released an open letter to the prime minister urging him to avoid “mixed signals” on the UK’s commitment to climate action. In their letter, the all-party parliamentary group on climate said: The Climate Change Committee’s recent 2023 progress report to parliament is unequivocal that mixed signals on the UK’s commitment to serious climate action is undermining this work, damaging our reputation, and risks us permanently surrendering our status as a world leader on climate action. Now is a crucial moment for you to demonstrate to the world that the UK is not demoting itself to become a passive observer in international action on climate change, that we remain a trusted partner and committed to delivering on our promises. Fiona Harvey has more on the letter here. There is not much in the diary for today, but here are two items that may produce news. 9.30am: The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities publishes homelessness statistics. 10am: Jeremy Quin, the Cabinet Office minister, gives evidence to the infected blood inquiry. Also, Lee Rowley, the local government minister, is hosting a roundtable meeting in Downing Street on plans announced overnight to speed up planning decisions for large infrastructure projects.

      "politics\/2023\/jul\/23\/suella-braverman-refuses-plea-of-man-barred-from-uk-to-be-reunited-with-son-siyabonga-twala The home secretary, Suella Braverman, has personally intervened to bar a man living in exile in Turkey from being reunited in the UK with his British son. Siyabonga Twala from Chester has been in limbo in Ankara for more than six months after he was blocked from boarding a flight back to Manchester last December. He wrote to the Home Office asking to be allowed to come back but instead Braverman has ordered his exclusion “on the basis of serious criminality” because of a cannabis offence from five years ago. Twala’s lawyer said Braverman’s intervention set a “worrying precedent”. Twala was on his way back from a family holiday to South Africa with his nine-year-old son, Mason, and his parents and siblings when he was prevented from boarding a flight home at Istanbul airport on 30 December. The trip was the first time that Twala, 34, had returned since his family relocated from Durban to Chester when he was 15. Twala had residency in the UK having grown up in Britain but had not yet applied for citizenship. His immigration status now hangs in the balance because of a 2018 conviction for possession of cannabis with intent to supply. He has not offended before or since and served four months of a nine-month sentence – lower than the 12-month threshold that triggers automatic deportation. A letter from the Home Office to Twala’s lawyer sent on 14 July, says: “The secretary of state has personally directed that you should be excluded from the United Kingdom (UK) on the grounds that your exclusion is conducive to the public good.” The letter concedes that Twala is considered at a low risk of reoffending but maintains that exclusion is appropriate “on the basis of serious criminality” because a court deemed that he dealt cannabis. The intervention carries no right of appeal or administrative review. The Labour MP Diane Abbott, who has campaigned on behalf of Windrush victims, said it was “shocking that the home secretary is using an exclusion order in this type of case”. She added: “This dad, resident in Britain, is not a threat to the general public and Suella must know this. Instead she is implementing powers meant to be used against serious criminals to permanently exclude this man from Britain with no due process and no right of appeal. “It is completely wrong that he is permanently separated from his son. Nothing that he has done justifies this. We can only hope that Suella Braverman thinks again” Nicholas Hughes, Twala’s lawyer at Duncan Lewis solicitors, said Braverman’s intervention set a “worrying precedent” for blocking people from the country. “The concern is about the precedent that this might set if it goes unchallenged for such a low bar to what is considered a serious criminal,” Hughes said. “He doesn’t pose a threat to society. It’s completely perverse to then say this is a proportionate response to a one-time drug offender. That’s lunacy.” Twala is likely to seek a judicial review of the decision. Hughes said: “This has to be challenged, not only to protect Siyabonga and bring him back with his family, but also to stop the home secretary abusing her discretion to apply to anyone she personally decides she doesn’t want in the UK, irrespective of whether or not it’s a proportionate or lawful thing to do.” Twala’s son Mason had to celebrate his ninth birthday last week without his father. “I speak to him as much as I can, but I can’t parent on the phone,” Twala said. The separation from his son and uncertainty over his future has taken its toll on Twala. “It’s been hell,” he said. “I’ve tried absolutely everything I can to stay sane but it’s been really difficult. I think it’s harder than prison.” Twala had a job in Britain as a heavy goods vehicle driver and a rented home with space for Mason but both have slipped through his fingers while he has been in exile. He has been relying on family help and charity from strangers to stay in Ankara and is doing his best to make his money stretch. “I’m eating one meal a day right now and some days I’m really hungry,” he said. A Home Office spokesperson said: “We do not comment on individual cases.”\n",
      "politics\/live\/2023\/jul\/20\/byelection-results-conservatives-labour-lib-dems-somerton-frome-uxbridge-south-ruislip-selby-ainsty-uk-politics-latest-news We’re closing down this live blog now. Thanks for reading and commenting. Here’s a summary of the day’s main events: The Conservatives lost two out of the three safe seats where byelections were being held. Labour wiped out a huge deficit from 2019 to take Selby and Ainsty, while the Liberal Democrats did similar in Somerton and Frome. The Tories managed to hold on to Boris Johnson’s former Uxbridge and South Ruislip seat, though. Keir Starmer congratulated his new MP Keir Mather, who will become the Baby of the House. Referring to the Tory MP Johny Mercer, he told Mather: “There was some silly sod on the radio, on the television last night saying you were only 25. But the answer is: You’re 25 and you’ve made history and he’s whatever age he is and he’ll soon be history. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, was urged to think carefully about pursuing the extension of London’s ultra-low emission zone. Local indications suggested the unpopularity of the move drove voters away from Labour in Uxbridge. But Khan offered a staunch defence of the policy. He said: “The decision to expand the ultra-low emissions zone was a tough one, but it’s the right one. Why? Because every year across our city, roughly speaking, 4,000 people died prematurely.” The elections expert Prof Sir John Curtice said the Tories “should not take too much comfort” from the victory in Uxbridge and South Ruislip. He said the Conservative candidate himself Steve Tuckwell said his victory was all down to the Ulez issue. Tuckwell did not interpret the result as an endorsment of Rishi Sunak, and his five priorities, Curtice said. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, claimed the Uxbridge result showed the next general election was not a done deal. He said: “Westminster’s been acting like the next election is a done deal. The Labour party has been acting like it’s a done deal. The people of Uxbridge just told all of them that it’s not.” The Lib Dem leader, Ed Davey, used the platform his party’s victory provided to urge Sunak to call a general election now. While there is almost no chance of the prime minister taking his advice, Davey did take the opportunity to say: “The people of Somerton and Frome have spoken for the country and sent a message to this appalling Conservative government. Messages from the former prime minister Boris Johnson’s old phone were retrieved and will be given to the Covid inquiry, his spokesman said. Technical experts recovered all relevant messages, and he will hand them over “unredacted”. Keir Starmer has labelled the government minister Johnny Mercer a “silly sod” who will “soon be history”, after he compared the party’s new 25-year-old MP to a character from cult Channel 4 comedy The Inbetweeners. The minister for veterans’ affairs said Keir Mather had been “dropped into” the Selby and Ainsty constituency and “spouted identikit Keir Starmer lines”, having earlier said: We don’t want parliament to become like The Inbetweeners. The Labour leader hit back at Mercer in Selby on Friday, as he celebrated the byelection victory alongside Mather and his deputy leader Angela Rayner. Walking along the pitch at Selby Town FC and surrounded by media, Starmer told the new MP: There was some silly sod on the radio, on the television last night saying you were only 25. But the answer is: You’re 25 and you’ve made history and he’s whatever age he is and he’ll soon be history. Mather will become the youngest MP in the Commons – the Baby of the House – after overturning a 20,137 Conservative majority to win the North Yorkshire seat for Labour. The Inbetweeners, which aired in the late 2000s, follows four adolescent friends at school who end up in awkward and embarrassing situations. Explaining his comments to Sky News on Friday, Mercer said: I think this synthetic outrage, identikit Labour politician is the opposite of what people like me came into politics for. He’s been at Oxford University more than he’s had a job, right? So if you can really apply that to the empathy required to understand what it’s really like in this country at the moment, in terms of the cost of living and all these experiences of these people he’s trying to represent. Personally, I don’t think that is conducive to good electoral representation and I’m more than entitled to have that view. The Home Office has denied its barge housing asylum seekers is a “floating prison” and said the people on board would be “free to come and go as they want”, the PA news agency reports. Gardening in nearby allotments and hiking tours of the area were among the activities which could be offered to about 500 migrants set to board the giant vessel berthed on the most southerly point of Dorset’s Jurassic coast. Officials were keen to stress efforts the department had made to allay the concerns of people in Portland – a small island with a population of about 13,600 people – as they led a press tour of the vessel on Friday. The deputy director for asylum accommodation, Leanne Palk, disputed claims made by campaigners about the facilities. It isn’t a floating prison. People are free to come and go as they want, but we do have this secure fenceline in place just so that people don’t wander around the port. It is a working port and we need to keep the safety of the asylum seekers on board the vessel at the heart of everything we do. Palk said it was unlikely asylum seekers would leave the barge and never return, adding: “They’ve got a vested interest in having their asylum claim processed.” The former prime minister’s spokesman said: Boris Johnson is pleased that technical experts have now successfully recovered all relevant messages from the device. As repeatedly stated, he will now deliver this material in unredacted form to the inquiry. The inquiry process requires that a security check of this material is now made by the Cabinet Office. The timing of any further progress on delivery to the inquiry is therefore under the Cabinet Office’s control. It was always the case that Boris Johnson would pass this material to the inquiry and do everything possible to help it be recovered. A careful process approved by the inquiry has been followed to ensure that this was successful. Technical experts have recovered all relevant messages from Boris Johnson’s old phone that he had been advised not to use on security grounds, and he will hand them over “unredacted” to the coronavirus inquiry, a spokesman for the former prime minister has said. Craig Mackinlay, the chair of the Conservative net zero scutiny group, has told the Daily Telegraph that, in the light of the Uxbridge byelection result, the government should abandon the plan to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030. He said: We need to get the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars overturned at least until 2035, which is where most of the developed world is going. It is pre madness to saddle ourselves with this deadline. Mackinlay, like the other Conservatives who have today been calling for government green measures to be delayed or abandoned (see 8.46am, 10.17am and 10.35am), was never very keen on them anyway. But, with Keir Starmer signalling that he also favours a review of how the Ulez extension is being implemented (see 2.21pm), it is likely that people in No 10 are thinking about the electoral politics of this too. That is all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is taking over now. Here are two takes on the byelection results from Conservative-leaning commentators, published by the leftwing New Statesman and the rightwing ConservativeHome. For Tories, the ConHome article is more negative. David Gauke, the former Tory cabinet minister, says in the New Statesman that Tory MPs will be alarmed by these results. The Conservatives are under attack from all directions and very few of their MPs can be entirely confident their seats are safe. Morale is low and activists are demotivated; a desperate party may be susceptible to bad ideas to recover its position. But the Uxbridge result does provide some comfort. Ulez is a local issue, applicable to a relatively small number of seats, but the impact this matter had was greater than one would expect if there was genuine enthusiasm for Labour. This provides a small glimmer of hope for the Tories, which is more than many of them were expecting yesterday. And Paul Goodman, the ConservativeHome editor, says on his website that Rishi Sunak is doomed if he does not change course. There is a danger this morning that Team Sunak will breathe a sigh of relief and carry on with business as usual – so running into the autumn’s party conference with the five pledges and little else. There will be a temptation to delay cabinet changes, which may be fine; but there will also be one to minimise them when they come, which wouldn’t be. As matters stand, the prime minister is on course to be ejected from Downing Street. To date, he hasn’t set out a view of the challenges facing Britain and how his government plans to tackle them. Instead, he has stuck to the five priorities. That plan may well have made sense when he first entered Number Ten. But it is running out of steam. A narrow win in Uxbridge doesn’t change the bleakness of this position – though it’s certainly a reminder that Labour has weaknesses that can be identified and punished. During the mid-Thatcher period, her ministers divided into “consolidators” and “radicals”. Sunak and his team have no choice but to be radical. After all, there’s nothing much in his present position to consolidate. About 20% of people reading the blog today are from outside the UK. Here is a question from one of them, which I’ll answer here for the sake of non-British readers. I am writing from outside the UK. Following your coverage of the byelections I noticed that in the background of the two men who won against the Tories, there are strange things going on. There’s someone with a metal bucket over his head, a woman with what looks like one of those talking dolls and a man with a huge label “Loony Party”. As someone from Switzerland, I cannot quite understand if they wanted to place an ironic protest or if they actually participated in the elections? Maybe you could elaborate. I’m afraid it’s not a protest. These are actual candidates, which is why they are allowed on stage when the result is declared. In the UK it does not cost much to stand as a candidate in a byelection (you need to put down a deposit of £500, which is returned if you get more than 5% of the vote) and in the UK there is a long tradition of oddballs and eccentrics standing as candidates. They seem to enjoy the attention. They are following in the tradition of the late Screaming Lord Sutch, who always stood in byelections for the Monster Raving Loony party. He could be genuinely funny, and did satirise the political process effectively. There were 17 candidates in the Uxbridge byelection, a near record. (See 6.17am.) Some of them were making a protest about the extension of the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez), but several were definitely at the less serious end of the market. Obviously, I can assure foreign readers that here in the UK the cranks and weirdos never actually get elected to parliament … Chris Skidmore, the Conservative MP who led a review of net zero policies for the government, has urged politicians to be honest about the need for policies like the Ulez extension. Accepting that the Uxbridge byelection became a referendum on Ulez, he said: The reality is that Ulez was a Conservative policy, introduced by Boris Johnson as mayor and recently agreed by this government to be expanded in May 2020, as part of Covid loans to the mayor. It helps no one in politics if we are not honest about the reality of pollution in our cities and the health consequences of this, but we also need to be honest about what investments are needed to deliver policies with public support. This is what the net zero review very clearly set out: we need long-term investment to encourage private sector investment and to create a just transition by establishing the effective incentives to decarbonise. Keir Starmer has also urged Sadiq Khan to “reflect” on the implementation of the Ulez extension. Referring to the result in Uxbridge and South Ruislip, he told broadcasters: We didn’t take it in 1997 when we had a landslide Labour victory. And Ulez was the reason we didn’t win there yesterday. We know that. We heard that on the doors. And we’ve all got to reflect on that, including the mayor. Asked what “reflect” meant and whether the scheme should now be scrapped, Starmer replied: We’ve got to look at the result. The mayor needs to reflect. And it’s too early to say what should happen next. Here is a question from a reader about tactical voting, and electoral reform. Looking at the effects of tactical voting, will Keir Starmer rethink his attitude to first past the post? The tactical votes have essentially shown what transferable votes, or the like, would achieve. I imagine there will be considerable pressure on a Labour government to enact electoral reform, especially if the Lib Dems and Greens break through more widely. Almost certainly, no. The results do show a remarkable level of anti-Tory tactical voting by Labour and Lib Dem supporters. And it is true that Starmer is under pressure to agree to electoral reform. His party conference voted in favour of it. But Starmer, and a lot of Labour traditionalists on this issue, would argue that these results just show that Labour can attract votes from the wider progressive electorate without having to offer PR. Labour is not opposed to tactical voting. MPs won’t endorse it publicly, not least because they can be thrown out of the party for encouraging people to vote for someone else. But Labour kept its campaigning to a minimum in Somerton and Frome, in effect giving the Lib Dems a free run, and it would be surprising if the two parties don’t operate informal non-aggression pacts like this in dozens of seats at the general election. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, should review the way he is implementing the Ulez extension, Emily Thornberry, the shadow attorney general, has said. Khan has vigorously defended the policy this morning (see 1.12pm), and played down suggestions it was to blame for Labour not winning the Uxbridge and South Ruislip byelection (see 12.35pm). But Thornberry suggested the implementation of the policy was a problem. In an interview with the World at One she said: I think it’s the right policy – I suspect it’s the way it’s being done [that is problematic]. And I hope that Sadiq will look at it again, I know that we’re asking him to. Thornberry also said that the government had given cities like Birmingham, Bristol and Bradford money to help fund scrappage schemes as part of low-emission policies, but that London had not received this help. She urged central government to work with the London mayor to ensure that air quality could be improved. Including the byelections last night, there have been nine byelections in Conservative-held seats this parliament, not eight, as an earlier post said. (See 9.45am.) The Tories have held three of them, and lost the other six. Here is more from what Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, said today defending the extension of Ulez. (See 12.35pm.) The policy almost certainly stopped Labour gaining Uxbridge and South Ruislip in the byelection, and there is some evidence that the result could prompt a wider rethink about the electoral wisdom of green policies that impose costs on voters. But Khan was unreprentant. He told BBC News: The decision to expand the ultra-low emissions zone was a tough one, but it’s the right one. Why? Because every year across our city, roughly speaking, 4,000 people died prematurely. There are children with stunted lungs forever, adults with a whole host of health issues, from asthma to cancer, dementia to heart disease. So we do want to clean up the air in London. I think it’s a human right, not a privilege. Nobody puts up with dirty water. Why dirty air? We’re going to carry on listening, we’re going to carry on monitoring the policy, monitoring take-up. One of the reasons why I’ve announced a massive £110m scrappage scheme is to support those Londoners to make the transition. We’ve widened the eligibility to even more Londoners. Asked if Ulez would cost Labour votes in the mayoral election next year, or in the general election, Khan replied: I’m hoping Ulez is expanded by the end of August. We saw in 2021 this was a big issue for the Conservative candidate … We’re listening to Londoners. Londoners are struggling through this cost of living crisis. But Londoners are suffering the consequences of air pollution. I’m quite clear; it’s the poorest Londoners who are least likely to own a car, [and to] suffer the worst consequences [of air pollution] – that can’t be right. It’s black Londoners least likely to own a car who suffer the worst consequences – that can’t be right. This is an issue of social justice and racial justice. But I recognise there are some Londoners worried about Ulez. That’s why we’ve widened the eligibility and provided record support for Londoners. It’s a shame that the government hasn’t given us a penny of support towards the scrappage scheme. This afternoon Labour’s national policy forum will meet in the east Midlands. The conference will run until Sunday and, although the NPF does not write the party’s manifesto, it does establish a policy framework for the document. As Ben Quinn reports, the leadership faces a challenge from the left on a series of issues. Alan Wager, a politics academic, argues that the Uxbridge result could make it easier for those in the party wanting to push back against more radical policy options. At one point there was speculation that we might get a government reshuffle today. But No 10 is now ruling that out, Pippa Crerar reports. Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, has defended his decision to extend Ulez (the ultra-low emission zone) to outer London. This will lead to drivers with polluting cars having to pay £12.50 a day to drive them in places like Uxbridge, and campaigning against the move was almost certainly the factor that enabled the Tories to hold the seat. Khan justified the Ulez extension, saying he was “determined to clear the air” in London. He said: Of course I am disappointed that this seat, which has never been Labour in my lifetime, didn’t go Labour last night. Obviously I welcome the 7% swing to Labour in this outer London seat and we are determined to clear the air in London. Keir Starmer is now taking questions from journalists. He says Labour has never overturned a majority of this size. The party must show that it will deliver. Q: What are you priorities for this constituency? To show that everyone can get on, to ensure that public services are working, and to give a sense that the country is moving forward, says Starmer. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, delivers a short speech. She says she is in a “sandwich of Keirs”; she has Keir Starmer standing next to her on one side, and Keir Mather, the new MP, standing on the other side. And Mather says that being the new MP is the privilege of his life, and that he can’t wait to get started. Starmer thanks those who have put their trust in Labour. He says the byelection result is a vindication of the way the Labour party has changed. He says: The priorities of working people are our priorities. And that’s why people are prepared to put their trust in the Labour party. They want a party in government focused on their priorities of jobs, of health, of public services and opportunities for everyone, wherever they are. By changing our party, listening to voters, we’ve shown what a changed Labour party could do. He also says the byelection only happened in the first place because of “the chaos, the division, the infighting in the Tory party”. Keir Starmer has now arrived at a Labour rally in Selby, where he is giving a speech to activists. He says this is the first time Labour has overturned a majority of 20,000. And, because he does not believe in complacency, he says it is the first time he can say: “Well done, Keir.” The successful candidate in Selby and Ainsty, and its next MP, is Keir Mather. Keir Starmer has arrived in Selby, with his deputy, Angela Rayner: Boris Johnson has put a message on Twitter saying the Uxbridge result shows the Tories can win all over the country. Fantastic news from Uxbridge. Well done @tuckwell_steve and the amazing Conservative council and association members. This shows the Conservatives can win in London and around the country. Johnson was the previous MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip and the byelection only happened because he resigned when he learned that the Commons privileges committee was going to recommend a suspension that could have led to a recall byelection. Today’s result could be seen as implying that, if Johnson had held on and fought a recall byelection, he would have won. But there is no guarantee of that. The Conservatives won the byelection because they successfully turned it into a referendum on Ulez. If Johnson had been the candidate, that would have been impossible, because the byelection would almost certainly have been a referendum about him, and about his lying over Partygate (the subject of the privileges committee inquiry). Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, is in Frome, celebrating his party’s victory in the Somerton and Frome byelection. The Liberal Democrats (for reasons best known to themselves) adore cheesy, photocall stunts, and this morning Davey fired a mock circus cannon to illustrate his message about it being time to “get these clowns out of No 10”. Davey also urged Rishi Sunak to call a general election now – which, of course, he won’t. Davey said: The people of Somerton and Frome have spoken for the country and sent a message to this appalling Conservative government. People are struggling to get a GP appointment or find a dentist for their kids. They are working hard and making big sacrifices just to make ends meet, and yet the Conservatives are so out of touch they don’t even seem to notice. That’s why lifelong Conservative voters have turned to the Liberal Democrats in their thousands, and why longtime Labour voters have lent us their support to get the Conservatives out. Ringmaster Rishi is out of touch, out of ideas and out of excuses. It’s time for a general election to end this Conservative circus and get these clowns out of No 10. And here are some of the most interesting comments on the byelection results from commentators on Twitter. From James Johnson, a pollster who used to work for Theresa May From Sam Freedman, a Prospect columnist From Robert Colvile, head of the Centre for Policy Studies thinktank From Ben Walker from Britain Elects and the New Statesman From the academic Will Jennings From Keiran Pedley from the polling firm Ipsos From David Boothroyd, a Labour councillor and political historian From Luke Tryl, head of More in Common UK, which campaigns for inclusivity The elections expert Lewis Baston has written a good analysis of the results for the Guardian. He says the Conservatives should not take too much comfort from what happened in Uxbridge. He says: The Conservatives will find it hard to replicate the anti-incumbent technique outside London or Wales, and there are only a handful of other constituencies that resemble Uxbridge electorally or demographically (and the Uxbridge swing is big enough to take out some of them). The problem the Tories have is that there are large numbers of constituencies that are a bit like Selby and Ainsty or Somerton and Frome. Selby and Ainsty in North Yorkshire is a mixture of small towns, commuter villages and some countryside, neither poor nor affluent. It has elements of “red wall” and “middle England” and a big swing here has wide implications. The Uxbridge result might caution us against expecting too many Labour advances into new territory in 2024, but Selby and Ainsty suggests Labour is on course to rebuild the electoral coalition that previously brought it victory. Somerton and Frome was part of a swathe of rural and small-town former Lib Dem seats in the south-west that seemed like extinct volcanoes after the coalition government and Brexit. If these seats are in flux, the Conservatives face a daunting task if they are to retain an overall majority … The swings since 2019 look as if they are all over the place – 29% to the Lib Dems in Somerton and Frome, 24% to Labour in Selby and Ainsty, and only 7% to Labour in Uxbridge and South Ruislip. But from a longer perspective it looks a lot clearer. It is less dangerous to prognosticate on the basis of three byelections in very different types of seat than it is for a single byelection. In 1997 the Lib Dems gained Somerton and Frome by 130 votes – in 2023 they gained it by 11,008. In 1997 Labour gained the Selby constituency by 3,836 – in 2023, on less favourable boundaries, Labour gained by 4,161. And in 1997 the Conservatives held Uxbridge by 724 votes; in 2023 they held a somewhat more Tory version of the seat by 495 votes. These results, allowing for the Lib Dems’ winning ways in byelections, show the level and distribution of the parties’ support is a bit worse for the Conservatives than it was in 1997. The Brexit realignment? Left on economics, right on culture? Gone like tears in rain. The full article is here. David Frost, the former Brexit minister, is also urging Rishi Sunak to scale back net zero policies. He tweeted: The lesson is surely that green policies are very unpopular when there’s a direct cost to people - as indeed all the polling says. This time that hit Labour. But soon it could be us unless we rethink heat pumps &amp; the 2030 electric car deadline. Conclusion: any autumn relaunch has to offer Conservative policies that bring back people who voted for us in 2019: tax, immigration, net zero, and more. There is a route to victory - but it means a rethink. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, and his deputy, Angela Rayner, are on their way to Selby: Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, told Times Radio she was “cautiously optimistic” about her party’s chances at the general election in the light of the byelection results. She said: If you look at where we were in 2019 as a political party after that general election, and if you’d have said today I’d be talking to you about a win in Selby in a byelection and overturning a 20,000 majority for the Conservatives, you’d have laughed me out of the studio. Rishi Sunak met Susan Hall, the new Tory candidate for London mayor, in Uxbridge this morning. On Wednesday his press secretary admitted that, on various issues, he did not fully agree with her views. Like Jacob Rees-Mogg (see 8.46am), the Conservative MP John Redwood is also saying the Uxbridge result should lead to a government rethink on green policies. Keir Mather, who won Selby and Ainsty for Labour, is 25. He will be the youngest MP when he takes his seat, having previously been a researcher for Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary. In an interview with Sky News overnight, Johnny Mercer, the veterans minister, implied that he was too young to be an MP. Asked if an injection of youth would be good for parliament, Mercer replied: I think it’s always good to get new people in politics, but I think we mustn’t become a repeat of The Inbetweeners. Asked to explain what he meant, Mercer said: You’ve got to have people who have actually done stuff. This guy has been at Oxford University more than he’s been in a job. You put a chip in him there and he just relays Labour lines, and the problem is people have kind of had enough of that. They want people who are authentic. People who have worked in that constituency, who know what life is like, understand what life is like to live, work and raise a family in communities like theirs. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said Mercer’s comments showed the “contempt” that the Tories had, not just for Mather, but for the people who voted for him too. Greg Hands, the Conservative chair, refused to endorse what his colleague said. Asked if he thought Mercer’s comment was appropriate, he told LBC: “I welcome young people coming into politics. We’ve got young Conservative MPs ourselves, young MPs in their 20s.” Speaking to Tories in Uxbridge, Rishi Sunak said the byelection results showed the need for him to “double down” on delivering on people’s priorities (his five pledges). He also claimed it was normal for the governing party to lose seats in byelections. He said: Byelections, midterms for an incumbent government, are always difficult. They rarely win them. The message I take away is that we’ve got to double down, stick to our plan and deliver for people. That’s what I heard when I was out on the doorsteps and that’s what we’re going to do. This is not quite true. Including the three contests yesterday, there have been nine byelections in what were Conservative-held seats this parliament. The Tories have lost six of them, but won three. UPDATE: The final paragraph has been corrected because it originally said eight byelection in Tory-held seats, not nine. Here is my colleague Kiran Stacey’s analysis of what the results means. And here is an extract. Conservatives portrayed the results as a sign that Labour’s huge national poll lead is vulnerable, especially when the Tories find the right issues to campaign on, as they did in Uxbridge with Labour’s plan to extend London’s Ultra-low emission zone. However, pollsters say the dramatic swings against Sunak’s party in Selby and Ainsty and Somerton and Frome show the national mood has turned against them, and may not return in time for next year’s general election. The Green party came third in all three byelections last night, with 10% of the vote in Somerton (where Labour lost its deposit), 5% in Selby (where the Lib Dems lost their deposit) and 3% in Uxbridge. Adrian Ramsay, the Green co-leader, said his party was the only one to increase its vote share in all three contests. He said: Greens came a credible third in each seat. We were the only party to increase our vote share in all three contests. That’s because we offered a clear alternative, though we were squeezed in the particular circumstances of these byelections. These were three Conservative seats with very significant majorities. A competent government that was providing solutions to the real, deep-seated crises facing our country would have held all three of them. The fact that they lost two of them underscores just how tired and fed up voters are with them. They have let the country down over the cost of living, over the climate emergency and over standards in public life. Now they are paying the price. Labour will make the best of the Selby result, but the truth is that a government in waiting - which is what Labour believe themselves to be - would have done even better against a Conservative party that has been the most chaotic and damaging in modern history, crashed the economy and repeatedly failed the environment. Sunder Katwala, from the British Future thinktank, points out on Twitter that the Greens did better than all the various rightwing, populist candidates. Reform UK’s best result was in Selby and Ainsty, where it got almost 4%. BBC News is showing footage of Rishi Sunak speaking to reporters in Uxbridge. He said the Uxbridge result showed that the next general election was not a done deal. He said: Westminster’s been acting like the next election is a done deal. The Labour Party has been acting like it’s a done deal. The people of Uxbridge just told all of them that it’s not. No one expected us to win here. But Steve [Tuckwell’s] victory demonstrates that, when confronted with the actual reality of the Labour party, when there’s an actual choice on a matter of substance at stake, people vote Conservative. Labour supporters may fear that Sunak has a point, but it is worth remembering that Labour has not won a parliamentary election in Uxbridge since 1966. Even in the Blair years, it was Tory. There was a byelection there soon after Tony Blair became prime minister in 1997, but even with New Labour at its most popular, the Conservatives won. Keir Starmer has been accused of following the Blair playbook closely. You could argue that losing byelections in Uxbridge is part of that. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory former business secretary, is a Somerset MP, and he is being interviewed on the Today programme. Nick Robinson points out to him that, if the swing in the Somerton and Frome byelection were replicated in his seat at the general election, he would be out. Rees-Mogg says byelections are not always a good guide to what will happen in a general election. He says his message is “don’t panic”. He says in 1992 the Tories won back all the seats they had lost in byelections in the preceding parliament. And the Tories should learn a lesson from Uxbridge. Q: What lesson is that? Rees-Mogg replies: “That high-cost green policies are not popular.” Q: Greg Hands earlier defended government policy on the transition to green energy. Rees-Mogg says he agreed with what Hands said about going with the grain of human behaviours. He suggests there is no need to rush the phasing out of petrol and diesel cars. He repeats the point about the need for his party not to panic. They should support Rishi Sunak, he says. Q: You used to criticise him as socialist. Rees-Mogg says he wants the Tories to win the next election. No Conservative would want Keir Starmer in Downing Street. Q: Better the devil you know? Better a Conservative prime minister than a Labour one, Rees-Mogg says. He says the energy bill will put high charges on people. The government should not do that. Q: So you are saying back Rishi Sunak conditionally, provided he drops things like the energy bill. No, Rees-Mogg says. He wants Tories to back Sunak “regardless”, he says. UPDATE: Rees-Mogg said: You should learn from where the government has done surprisingly well against the form book, and learn there that high-cost green policies are not popular. I think the government should take away the power for these Ulezes, which is provided for by legislation ... You should go with the grain of what voters are doing anyway. Voters are year in, year out, buying cleaner cars with cleaner engines. The development of engines in recent decades have been phenomenal. You can do this by osmosis, rather than by hitting people, because actually all these charges hit the least well-off motorist rather than the rich motorist who buys a new car every few years anyway. Rishi Sunak is in Uxbridge with Steve Tuckwell, the victorious Conservative candidate, PA Media reports. They arrived in a cafe to loud clapping and cheering. PA says: The prime minister chatted to people sitting at the tables, celebrating the result which saw Tuckwell hold on with a majority of just 495, down from the 7,210 Boris Johnson secured in 2019. “Are you all pumped?” Mr Sunak said to one group as he thanked Tory campaigners. He also joked: “Normally when I get woken up at three in the morning it’s only bad news. So, it was a welcome change.” On BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Nick Robinson, is discussing the results with Prof Sir John Curtice, the elections expert. He points out that Curtice was chuckling as Greg Hands claimed that what mattered most was the Uxbridge result. Curtice repeats the point he made earlier about, overall, the fall in the Tory vote matching what the polls are saying. (See 7am.) Hands says the government is not opposed to ultra low emission zones. But he says the Tories think people should not have to replace their cars until their cars have reached the end of their lives. Policies like this need to be introduced gradually, he suggests, so that they “go with the grain of human nature”. He says Sadiq Khan botched the consultation on the Ulez policy. This shows that Labour cannot be trusted to run things, he says. Q: What does Rishi Sunak have to change to respond to the concerns of the voters in Somerton and Frome, and in Selby and Ainsty? Hands says the government is focusing on the people’s priorities. Q: So you are not going to change – just carry on as now. Hands says the government needs to continue the work it is doing. Q: But the results show this is not what people want. Hands says there is a long history of people voting against governments in byelections. He goes on: Byelections are not always a good predictor of general elections. Greg Hands, the Conservative chair, is being interviewed by Nick Robinson on the Today programme. He says Uxbridge was the standout result of the night. It was not expected, he says. Q: But you need to face up to reality too. What do you think the voters are telling you? Hands says the voters “are saying that the Conservatives need to do better”. But that is why Rishi Sunak has set five priorities, he says. Q: Which ones are you actually delivering on? Hands claims the government is making progress. Q: But are you actually meeting any of them? You accept that? Hands says they were “not designed to be an easy thing to meet”. He says during the campaigns he picked up “a real misgiving about Labour in power”. And that was reflected in Uxbridge, which is in London, where Sadiq Khan has been in power, he says. George Osborne, the Conservative former chancellor, claims the Uxbridge result will give his party hope. He says: Despite dire results in Selby and Somerton – winning Uxbridge has given the Tories something very precious, that they didn’t have yesterday: hope. Hope they can get voters focused on what a Starmer government would mean for their cost of living. Hope this is more like 92 than 97. Rishi Sunak has posted a message on Twitter congratulating Steve Tuckwell, the Conservative candidate who won the Uxbridge and South Ruislip byelection. Asked about the defeat in Selby, Greg Hands, the Conservative chair, claimed it was caused by Tory supporters staying at home. He told GB News: Clearly we’re disappointed by the result in Selby and Ainsty. We had a fantastic candidate in Claire Holmes. What I would say is that result was driven largely by Conservative voters – previous Conservative voters – staying home. Clearly we’ve got work to do to win back the trust and confidence, we don’t deny that. Rishi Sunak has been in office now for nine months working very hard against the five priorities of halving inflation, restoring growth, reducing debt, cutting hospital waiting lists and stopping the boats. That is still work in progress. We’ll be fighting hard to regain that constituency next year. There may be some truth in the claim that some Tory supporters “stayed at home” during the byelection. But this is a normal occurrence in byelections, and it does not explain why the swing from the Tories to Labour was the second biggest since 1945. (See 5.39am and 7am.) The turnout was not particularly low in the byelection. Including those last night, there have been 16 byelections in this parliament. Only five of them had a higher turnout than in Selby and Ainsty. Greg Hands, the Conservative party chair, accused Keir Starmer this morning of “flip-flopping” on Ulez. In an interview with GB News he said: There’ll be real questions in Labour headquarters today about not gaining Uxbridge. Londoners see that Labour is not good at running things and they see that Keir Starmer is changing his views all the time depending on the audience that he has in front of him. In inner London he’s pro-Ulez, put him in outer London he’s suddenly expressing his doubts about Ulez. Hands was using the “flip-flop” line because portraying Starmer as someone who is unreliable, and who keeps performing U-turns, has become one of the Conservative party’s main attack claims. On Ulez, the Tories were entitled to claim that the policy was being introduced by the Labour mayor of London, but opposed by the Labour candidate in Uxbridge, where voters will be affected by the extension. Starmer’s line on Ulez was similar to that set out by Angela Rayner this morning (see 7.40am); he said that in principle he was in favour, but that he thought central government should have funded a more generous scrappage scheme to minimise the financial impact on drivers affected. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, told BBC Breakfast that the problem with Ulez, the ultra low emission zone being extended to outer London, was that central government had not provided London with enough funding to help people, via scrappage schemes, who need to get rid of polluting cars. She argued that the Uxbridge result did not mean Ulez was wrong in principle; it just showed that people needed financial support to change their behaviour. She said: At the moment the government is failing to provide the support for people to change their behaviours. And they can’t outsource it to mayors or to cities. This is a problem that’s going to hit most of the UK because we do have emissions in some of our big major towns and cities that are unsafe for people and we’ve got to clean up our act. But that means we’ve got to help people to do that. The result in Uxbridge tells you that people want to do the right thing, but they don’t want to be penalised because they can’t afford to change their vehicles and there isn’t a scrappage scheme that complies with the legislation to help them do the right behaviours. So I think the public want to do the right thing, they just want to make sure they’re not penalised. I hear that and I think it’s something all political parties need to reflect on. Ian Dunt, the political commentator and author of the superb How Westminster Works … And Why It Doesn’t, has posted a good thread on Twitter arguing that what is really significant about the byelection results is what Uxbridge says about how easy it is to mobilise opposition to environmental measures. Daisy Cooper, the Lib Dem deputy leader, told the Today programme that the result in Somerton and Frome showed her party were “back in the west country”. She said there were 15 seats in the west country with smaller majorities than the one overturned in Somerton and Frome. She went on: There are seats like Chippenham and Cheltenham and Taunton Deane and places like that that we’re really going to be targeting. Amongst those 15 seats, we’re going to look at the result that we’ve had this morning and we’ll be looking at what other prospects there might be for us in that area. Nadine Dorries, the former culture secretary and Boris Johnson uber-loyalist, is arguing that the Uxbridge result is some sort of endorsement for her former boss. She has posted this on Twitter. If the horrible fictional invented by the media ‘long Boris’ syndrome did exist, it would have been felt the worst in his own former constituency. The swing and the numbers show v clearly, angry Tories won’t turn out for Sunak - they know how to administer their own justice. It’s an unusual view. According to a report in the Telegraph last week, Johnson’s only involvement in the campaign was a call to Steve Tuckwell, the Tory candidate, asking him if he had read Johnson’s Mail column about Ulez. “After Mr Tuckwell responded that he had read the piece, Mr Johnson replied: ‘Very good,’ and the call ended,” the Telegraph reported. But Dorries might not be entirely wrong. Her point about the Uxbridge result not being an endorsement for Rishi Sunak is one that Prof Sir John Curtice has been making too. (See 7am.) Keir Starmer has posted a message on Twitter saying the result in Selby and Ainsty shows “how powerful the demand for change is”. He says: Congratulations @Mather_Keir, Labour’s new MP for Selby and Ainsty! Last night, Selby and Ainsty made history. This incredible result shows how powerful the demand for change is. Only Labour can deliver that change, and build a better Britain. Prof Sir John Curtice, the BBC’s elections specialist, has delivered his assessment of the results on the Today programme. Here are his main points. Curtice said the swing in Selby, at almost 24 percentage points, was the second biggest swing from the Conservatives to Labour in a parliamantary byelection. The only bigger one was the swing in the Dudley West byelection in 1994 (29 points), he said. He said the swing in Somerton and Frome (29 percentage points) was only the fifth biggest byelection swing from the Tories to the Liberal Democrats. But two of the bigger ones were also in this parliament, he said, in Tiverton and Honiton, and in North Shropshire. He said it showed the Lib Dems were able to squeeze the Labour vote. He said the Tories “should not take too much comfort” from the victory in Uxbridge and South Ruislip. He said the Conservative candidate himself, Steve Tuckwell, said his victory was all down to the Ulez issue. Tuckwell did not interpret the result as an endorsment of Rishi Sunak, and his five priorities, Curtice said. He said, across all three byelections, the average drop in Conservative support was 21 points. That roughly matches the 18-point drop in Conservative support that the national opinion polls are showing, he said. He went on: In other words, taken as a piece, these three by elections are consistent with the depressing message of the opinion polls that the Conservatives are a long way behind. And he said Uxbridge result, which showed voters punishing Labour because of Ulez, would probably boost those in the party urging Keir Starmer to adopt a so-called “Ming vase” strategy (an ultra cautious, no risk approach). Curtice said the result showed the risk of “bold and perhaps desirable” policies that upset the electorate. It is called the “Ming vase” approach because Roy Jenkins once described Tony Blair, ahead of the 1997 election, as being like someone being very cautious because they were carrying a Ming vase across a shiny floor and were worried about dropping it. Some in Labour, notably Alastair Campbell in his The Rest is Politics podcast, argue that Ming vaseism isn’t enough, and that Labour needs to make a bold offer to voters too.

I’m handing over now to the brilliant Andrew Sparrow – stay tuned. If you’re just waking up – or just tuning in – here is what happened in the UK byelections: Labour and the Liberal Democrats each won a seat off the Tories, who kept the third seat, formerly Boris Johnson’s, of Uxbridge and South Ruislip. The winning Conservative candidate for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, Steve Tuckwell, blamed Labour’s failure to win on the London mayor, Sadiq Kahn, saying: “Sadiq Khan has lost labour this election and we know that it was his damaging and costly Ulez policy that lost them this election.” The Liberal Democrats won a sweeping victory in Somerton and Frome, with candidate Sarah Dyke crediting their win, in part, to the Tory’s “circus of chaos”. The swing at Somerton was 29.0 percentage points, or the equivalent of a net change of 29 in every 100 people who voted Tory in 2019 switching sides. The Somerton win makes Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey is the first leader of any political party to win four byelections since the 1990s, when Paddy Ashdown, founding leader of the Lib Dems, did so. Labour won Selby and Ainsty, making history with the largest Conservative majority (20,137) overturned by Labour at a byelection since 1945. Labour’s candidate in Selby, Keir Mather, is just 25 years old and will become the youngest MP in the House of Commons. Labour managed a swing of 23.7 points in Selby and Ainsty: the largest achieved by Labour at byelection since it won Dudley West from the Tories in December 1994 (29.1 points) and the second largest swing managed by Labour at a byelection since 1945. Labour’s win in Selby exceeds the national 12-point swing the party needs for an overall majority at the next general election and the 16-point swing suggested by recent polls. Labour has now gained two seats in byelections since the 2019 general election, after its 2022 win in Wakefield. Selby and Ainsty, tonight’s most exciting result, made history: it is the largest Conservative majority (20,137) overturned by Labour at a byelection since 1945. Here are the key numbers, via PA Media: The previous record was set at the Mid Staffordshire byelection in March 1990, when Labour overturned a Tory majority of 14,654. To win the seat, Labour needed a swing in the share of the vote of 17.9 percentage points: the equivalent of a net change of 18 in every 100 people who voted Conservative at the 2019 general election switching sides. They managed a swing of 23.7 points: the largest achieved by Labour at byelection since it won Dudley West from the Tories in December 1994 (29.1 points) and the second largest swing managed by Labour at a byelection since 1945. The Conservative share of the vote in Selby dropped sharply from 60% at the 2019 general election to 34%, while Labour’s share rose from 25% to 46%. The winner, 25-year-old Keir Mather, will become the youngest MP in the House of Commons. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey is the first leader of any political party to win four byelections since Paddy Ashdown - founding leader of the Lib Dems - did so in the early 1990s, PA reports. The Conservatives were defending a majority at Somerton of 19,213 and it is one of the largest of its kind to be overturned at a UK byelection since 1945, sitting just outside the top five. The result means the Lib Dems have regained a seat they first won at the 1997 general election and then held for 18 years - one of a number of constituencies in south-west England that once made up the party’s “yellow wall”, which was wiped out by the Conservatives in 2015. However, new Lib Dem MP Sarah Dyke will soon face a fresh challenge, as Somerton and Frome is one of a number of seats being abolished at the next general election due to boundary changes. It is being split in two to form the new constituencies of Glastonbury and Somerton and Frome and East Somerset. Key figures for Somerton and Frome, via PA: Somerton and Frome is the fourth seat the Liberal Democrats have taken from the Conservatives at a byelection since the 2019 general election. All of the seats have changed hands on huge swings in the vote. The swing at Somerton was 29.0 percentage points, or the equivalent of a net change of 29 in every 100 people who voted Tory in 2019 switching sides. This is well above the 14.9 point swing the Lib Dems needed to win the seat. It beats the swing the party achieved when they defeated the Conservatives at the byelection in Chesham and Amersham in June 2021 (25.2 points) and is just below the swing when they gained Tiverton and Honiton from the Tories in June 2022 (29.9 points). The party managed an even bigger swing when they defeated the Conservatives at North Shropshire in December 2021 (34.1 points). Here are some of the key facts and statistics from the results of Thursday’s byelections, via PA: Uxbridge and South Ruislip Labour needed a swing in the share of the vote of 7.6 percentage points to win Uxbridge and South Ruislip from the Conservatives, but fell short and managed only 6.7 points. This is well below the 12.7 point swing Labour achieved at the Wakefield byelection in June 2022, when they won the seat from the Tories. Labour did manage to cut the Conservative majority at Uxbridge from 7,210 at the 2019 general election to just 495, while the Tory share of the vote fell from 53% in 2019 to 45%. Labour’s share of the vote rose from 38% to 44%. Uxbridge and South Ruislip has been held continuously by the Conservatives since the seat was created in 2010 and new MP Steve Tuckwell is the third Tory to represent the area, after John Randall and former prime minister Boris Johnson. David Simmonds, the Conservative MP for neighbouring Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner, said he is delighted with the results and believes Tuckwell won because he is a “community person first”. “It shows the power of the local community, the strength of the feeling against Ulez, but also the sense that people have a high degree of confidence in the conservatives. The Tory’s win in this byelection should be seen as a “turning point”, Simmonds said. “I think this is yet another message that says that the conservative party has a lot to offer this party and we will continue to work to show that message. Labour’s Danny Beales left after the count was announced. Aged 25, the new Selby and Ainsty MP will become the youngest MP in the Commons, the baby of the house. Mather was named after Keir Hardie, the first leader of the Labour Party. He is a former researcher for shadow health secretary Wes Streeting. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mather will be “a fantastic MP who will deliver the fresh start Selby and Ainsty deserves”. His win comes after Labour was determined to “throw the kitchen sink” at taking the constituency from the Tories. Steve Tuckwell, the winning Conservative candidate for Oxbridge and Ruislip, said on stage after the victory was declared, “This message from the Uxbridge and Ruislip election is clear. Sadiq Khan has lost labour this election and we know that it was his damaging and costly Ulez policy that lost them this election.” Tuckwell argued that this byelection result boiled down to Ulez, and Labour’s “tactic … not to push Ulez” is what led to his victory. “I’ve campaigned tirelessly to ensure that the voices of Uxbridge and South Ruislip have been heard. We’ve been ignored for many many months now, even years on a lot of issues that have come out of Sadiq Khan and City hall. Asked whether Boris Johnson had any influence on the result, Tuckwell said: “Boris Johnson’s name was not on the ballot paper, mine was so there’s no influence there at all. “From the outset of this campaign, I have been the underdog. The polls, the pundits have predicted a big labour win. “I think they’ll be Labour MPs in outer London boroughs who will be looking at these results tonight with sweaty palms.” “This election result is now the voice of the people of Uxbridge and South Ruislip and he [Khan] has to listen.” It has been a busy and eventful night: all of the major developments are wrapped up here, by Helen Pidd, Mabel Banfield-Nwachi and Sammy Gecsoyler. The Labour party has won its biggest ever byelection victory by overturning a 20,000-vote Conservative majority in Selby and Ainsty, sending a 25-year-old to parliament. But Keir Starmer’s party failed to win Uxbridge and South Ruislip, Boris Johnson’s old constituency. The Conservatives held on to the outer London seat with a majority of 495, the only bit of good news in an otherwise miserable night for Rishi Sunak.” Read the full report: Labour’s victory means Keir Starmer has become the first party leader since Paddy Ashdown in the 1990s to win four byelections, PA reports. In Selby, the Conservatives blamed the outgoing MP, Nigel Adams, for their defeat. People were “really disappointed” that Adams quit in a huff because he didn’t get a seat in the Lords, said Andrew Jones, the scrupulously polite MP for Harrogate and Knaresborough, who has been overseeing much of the Tory campaigning in Selby. So, added Jones, was he. It was “the main talking point” on the doorstep, he claimed. The Liberal Democrats have now gained four seats from the Conservatives at byelections this parliament: Chesham and Amersham and North Shropshire in 2021, and Tiverton and Honiton last year. Labour has now gained two seats in byelections since the 2019 general election, after its 2022 win in Wakefield. Labour’s win in Selby exceeds both the national 12-point swing the party needs for an overall majority at the next general election and the 16-point swing suggested by recent polls. More on what makes the Selby result historic: gaining Selby sets a record for the size of majority overturned by Labour at a byelection, according to Dr Hannah Bunting and Prof Will Jennings, Sky election analysts. The highest majority the party has overturned at a byelection is 14,654 votes in Mid Staffordshire more than 30 years ago. Following the Selby and Ainsty victory, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: “This is a historic result that shows that people are looking at Labour and seeing a changed party that is focused entirely on the priorities of working people with an ambitious, practical plan to deliver. “Keir Mather will be a fantastic MP who will deliver the fresh start Selby and Ainsty deserves. “It is clear just how powerful the demand for change is. Voters put their trust in us – many for the first time. “After 13 years of Tory chaos, only Labour can give the country its hope, its optimism and its future back.” There was a 23.7 percentage point swing in the share of the vote from the Conservatives to Labour in Selby &amp; Ainsty. Labour needed a 17.9 point swing to take the seat. Asked how he feels about being the baby of the house, he says he’s “had much worse”. “It feels like we are on the path to being on the precipice of a Labour government,” he says. “This is the largest majority we’ve overturned in our history,” Mather tells Sky News. Cost of living is his number one priority, he says. A very happy Keir Mather, the 25-year-old Labour candidate who has just won Selby and Ainsty: Labour’s victory in Selby and Ainsty is the “largest numerical majority overturned by Labour in post-war history,” according to Britain Elects’ Ben Walker. “People opened their doors to us and embraced our positive vision for the future,” Mather says. “For too long, Conservatives up here and in Westminster, have failed us. And now that changes. It’s time for a fresh start,” he says. He thanks his partner Euan, too. He says he has encountered “so much hardship” while campaigning – hardship caused by the Tories. Labour have won Selby and Ainsty, achieving a historic result by winning despite the Tories having a majority of more than 20,000 votes. Labour now has a majority of 4,161 – and the youngest MP in parliament. Keir Mather, 25, is officially the baby of the house. 35,886 votes were cast, with 69 ballots rejected. The results are as follows: Labour: 16,456 Conservatives: 12,295 Yorkshire party: 1,503 Reform UK: 1,332 Independent: 99 The candidates are now on stage in Selby. Labour’s candidate in Selby, Keir Mather, would become the “baby of the house” by being the youngest MP, if elected. He is 25 years old. Candidates have been called forward to hear the provisional results before they are announced on stage. While we wait (just a little longer) for that result in Selby, here is the moment Sarah Dyke won in Somerton and Frome: A fun fact about a not very fun name: the building where the Selby result is being announced imminently was named by one Steve Wadsworth. He won a competition to choose a name for the leisure centre in Selby with the suggestion ‘Selby Leisure Centre’: While we wait for that result, back to Somerton and Frome: Liberal Democrat Leader Sir Ed Davey said said the “stunning victory” showed his party was “firmly back” in its former West Country stronghold. “Sarah Dyke will be an incredible local champion for the people of Somerset who have been neglected for far too long,” he said. “She will fight for stronger local health services, better access to GPs and a fair deal for rural communities during this cost of living crisis. “The people of Somerton and Frome have spoken for the rest of the country who are fed up with Rishi Sunak’s out-of-touch Conservative Government.” Cameras are trained on the podium at the Selby and Ainsty count. In Somerton and Frome, the Liberal Democrats overturned a near 20,000 majority to flip their fourth Tory seat since 2019. The Lib Dems won 21,187 votes with a 28-point swing while the Tories achieved their worst result in the history of the seat with 10,179 votes and 26% of the vote. Labour also achieved their worst result ever in the seat with 1,009 and 2.6% share of the vote, being beaten out by Reform UK who won 1,303 votes. Spirits were high early on among the Lib Dems with party sources briefing they had “romped home” before counting had officially begun. David Warburton, the former Conservative MP for the constituency, resigned last month after being suspended from the party in April 2022 amid claims of drug use and sexual harassment. He admitted the former but denied the latter. The allegations were being investigated by the independent complaints and grievance scheme (ICGS) at the time of his resignation. Unlike other contests won by the Liberal Democrats this parliament which saw the party flip true-blue seats orange, Somerton and Frome had a Liberal Democrat MP between 1997 and 2015. Sarah Dyke, the newly elected MP for the constituency, said in her victory speech: “Like so many places across the country, we have been let down and taken for granted for far too long by a tired and out of touch Conservative government.” Christine Jardine, the MP for Edinburgh West said: “Tonight shows we are back in a strength and a power to be reckoned with in this part of the country again.” Perhaps warning of what to expect in a victory lap on Friday, Ed Davey tweeted: “I think we’re going to need a bigger tractor.” The wait continues in Selby, where the election agents are doing their last inspection of ballot papers with “doubtful marks”. This can be fun. In 2015 one Conservative MP thanked the voter who drew a penis in the box next to his name, which ended up counting as a legitimate vote. Less jollity tonight, just the odd person writing NONE across all of the names on the list. Most people here seem to think that Labour has squeaked it – a major success in a seat where the Tories had a 20,000-plus majority. Andrew Jones, the Conservative MP for Harrogate, just told me he thinks the Tories are “a little short”, Meanwhile Labour says they are “cautiously optimistic”. So it’s looking like a Labour triumph here. The cameras are assembling at the podium, so a result is hopefully not too far away. We’re hearing the stage is set up in Selby and Ainsty and candidates are getting ready to to hear the results. Labour had been expected to comfortably win Uxbridge, where Johnson’s majority had dwindled to 7,210 in the 2019 general election – his first as prime minister. There was sufficient disbelief in the Labour camp that they had not in fact won the byelection that party officials demanded a recount. The second round delivered the same result: a slim Conservative victory, majority 495. Former postman Steve Tuckwell, the local Conservative councillor who will now take Johnson’s place in Westminster, had declared the vote a “referendum” on London’s ultra-low emission zone (Ulez). In his victory speech, Tuckwell referenced the mayor of London’s decision to expand the zone where people have to pay a £12.50 daily fee to drive if their car does not meet emission standards. “Sadiq Khan has lost Labour this election,” said Tuckwell. There was 6.7 percentage point swing in the share of the vote from Conservative to Labour in Uxbridge and South Ruislip. Labour needed a 7.6 point swing to take the seat. The byelection was triggered by Johnson’s shock resignation after the Commons privileges committee recommended a lengthy suspension from parliament for knowingly misleading parliament about lockdown parties in Downing Street. And a victorious Steve Tuckwell in Uxbridge and South Ruislip: Here is a victorious Sarah Dyke speaking in Somerton and Frome: If you’re just joining us: the Liberal Democrats have overturned a Tory majority of more than 19,000 to win the Somerton and Frome byelection. Sarah Dyke won the Somerset seat by 11,008 in a dramatic swing away from Rishi Sunak’s party. But the Tory leader was spared the prospect of being the first prime minister since 1968 to lose three byelections on the same day as Labour failed to secure victory in Boris Johnson’s former seat. Labour’s hopes are now pinned on Selby and Ainsty, where it is seeking to take a seat that the Conservatives were defending with a 20,137 majority. We’ll have analysis from our reporters on the ground in Uxbridge and South Ruislip and Somerton and Frome shortly. It’s just Selby and Ainsty we’re waiting for now. That might still be an hour or two away. A reminder: Selby and Ainsty is a seat in Yorkshire in the north of England. Labour would need to defeat the Tories by more than 20,000 votes here. According to Britain Elects, this would be the largest numerical majority overturned by Labour ever in the party’s history. There was 6.7 percentage point swing in the share of the vote from Conservative to Labour in Uxbridge and South Ruislip. Labour needed a 7.6 point swing to take the seat. A victory tweet: LibDem candidate for Somerton and Frome, Sarah Dyke, says that the victory is that of her loved ones as much as it is hers. “The Liberal Democrats are back in the west country,” says Dyke. She thanks lifelong Conservative voters for voting LibDem for the first time. “I will not let you down,” she says. “There is no doubt that our electoral system is broken, but your vote has shown the Conservatives can still be beaten under it.” The Liberal Democrats were right about that tractor – they have swept Somerton and Frome with more than 20,000 votes – a majority of 11,008 votes over the Conservatives. Liberal Democrats: 21,187 Tories: 10,179 Labour: 1,009 Independent: 635 Results are coming in now from Somerton and Frome. Here is some more analysis, via PA: The Tories have held on to Boris Johnson’s former seat in a blow to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer. Labour had hoped to take Uxbridge and South Ruislip, which the former prime minister held with a majority of 7,210 in 2019, but Tory Steve Tuckwell managed to retain it for Rishi Sunak’s party. The Conservative victory means that Sunak has been spared the prospect of being the first prime minister since 1968 to lose three byelections on the same day. London mayor Sadiq Khan’s policy of expanding the Ulez low emission zone to outer boroughs – including Uxbridge and South Ruislip – has been blamed for the party’s failure to take the seat. Labour candidate Danny Beales had distanced himself from the policy, saying it was “not the right time” to expand the £12.50 daily charge for cars which fail to meet emissions standards. The failure to overturn the Tory majority in the seat was dubbed “Uloss” by a party insider in a sign of the unease at Mr Khan’s plan. In public, senior Labour figures acknowledged Ulez had been a factor in the vote. Shadow justice secretary Steve Reed told the PA news agency: “I think there’s been a number of issues at play, but there has certainly been a number of voters who have said to us that they are very concerned about Ulez. “Everyone wants to see clean air. But for some people, I think, given the chaos that there is in the economy, because the Conservatives have crashed it and the cost-of-living crisis that they fuelled, that this is the wrong time to introduce a charge for Ulez.” Many of the seat’s candidates focused their campaign on London mayor Sadiq Khan’s plans to extend the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) to Uxbridge and South Ruislip. Conservative candidate Steve Tuckwell is making his victory speech in Boris Johnson’s former seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip on the outskirts of London. “Sadiq Khan has lost Labour this election,” with the Ulez policy, Tuckwell says. The Conservatives have held onto Uxbridge and South Ruislip, in what will be a very disappointing result for Labour, by just 495 votes. The Conservatives have held onto Uxbridge and South Ruislip, Boris Johnson’s former seat. Labour was hoping to win, with the Tories being holding the majority in 2019 by just 7,210 votes. Conservatives: 13,965 Labour: 13,470 LibDem: 526 Independent: 91 Results are about to be declared in Uxbridge and South Ruislip, where the result was so close that a recount was granted. The candidates have been called to the stage. Both the Tory and Labour candidates have arrived at the count in Uxbridge and South Ruislip: The recount is over in Uxbridge and South Ruislip, the Guardian’s Mabel Banfield-Nwachi reports, so we should have are result there soon. Timings from Britain Elects: We’re still expecting a declaration in Somerton and Frome within the hour – and likely sooner rather than later – where the Liberal Democrats remain confident of their victory. To Selby now, where counting is still in the early stages. I’ve just been having a chat with Andrew Jones, the scrupulously polite Conservative MP for Harrogate and Knaresborough, who has been overseeing much of the Tory campaigning in Selby. He said he was surprised how “policy-light” discussions had been on the doorstep, with “the main talking point being why we’re having this byelection in the first place, and that’s Nigel Adams’ resignation.” People are “really disappointed” that Adams quit in a huff because he didn’t get a seat in the lords, said Jones. So, added Jones, was he. Both he and Judith Cummins, the Labour MP for Bradford South, who has been running the Selby campaign for the red team, agreed that by far and away the biggest concern among the electorate was the cost of living. “It’s getting to a tipping point where it’s too much for everybody,” said Cummins. She said she took heart from how many voters were willing to give Labour a hearing. “To be in with a fighting chance of winning here, shows such a massive improvement over the four years of Keir Starmer’s leadership. Making in-roads in a rural community like this is massive for us.” Neither Jones nor Cummings could be drawn on who they think will win Selby. The wait continues. We’re hearing we could know the recount result in Uxbridge and South Ruislip in 45 minutes or so. Sky News political correspondent John Craig says, “We’ve been picking up Labour jitters throughout the evening” in Uxbridge and South Ruislip – and that those “jitters may be turning to panic”. Fact-checking organisation Full Fact explains how recounts work: Recounts are essentially at the discretion of the Returning Officer (the person who oversees the election in each constituency). They use guidelines issued by the Electoral Commission. Candidates and their agents are entitled to request recounts. A Returning Officer must consider any recount request but may by law refuse it if they deem it “unreasonable”. The results of that first ballot count in Uxbridge and South Ruislip are “very close”, the Guardian’s Mabel Banfield-Nwachi, who is at the count, reports. The Uxbridge and South Ruislip recount will happen straight away, so we will likely have a result within the next few hours. A recount has been requested in Uxbridge and South Ruislip – and that call has been granted, Lloyd White, the returning officer in Uxbridge has just said, per the BBC. Uxbridge and South Ruislip, on the fringes of London, was Boris Johnson’s seat. Labour was also the favourite to win –the Tory majority in 2019 was by just 7,210 votes. We’ll have more soon. Evening Standard political correspondent Rachael Burford says, quoting a Labour source, that the Uxbridge result could be “recount territory”. We’re hearing both the Uxbridge and South Ruislip and the Somerton and Frome results could be declared in the next ten minutes. The Selby result is a long way off (despite what I mistakenly said a moment ago – sorry). A reminder of the stakes as we prepare to (probably) learn the results in two of tonight’s three seats at around 2am BST, in ten minutes’ time: Uxbridge and South Ruislip, on the fringes of London: Boris Johnson’s seat. Labour is the favourite to win. The Tory majority in 2019 was by just 7,210 votes. Selby and Ainsty, in Yorkshire in the north of England: Labour would need to defeat the Tories by more than 20,000 votes here. According to Britain Elects, this would be the largest numerical majority overturned by Labour ever in the party’s history. Somerton and Frome, southwest England. The Liberal Democrats are so confident of their win that they declared it tonight two hours after polls closed. That is not an official declaration. The 2019 Tory majority is 19,213 votes. We’re hearing both the Uxbridge and South Ruislip and the Somerton and Frome results could be declared in the next fifteen minutes. Stay tuned. Voter turnout in Selby was 44.77%. Sky News deputy political editor Sam Coates has just said that it is “looking close”. If Labour takes Selby from the Tories, who won by more than 20,000 votes in 2019, it would be the largest numerical overturned by Labour ever in the party’s history. Sky News politics and business correspondent Amanda Akass says she’s been told by the leader of Somerset Council’s Conservative group that voters feel “let down” by David Warburton, the Tory MP suspended on drug allegations: Warburton announced in June that he was resigning his Somerton and Frome seat. Warburton was suspended from the party in April 2022 pending the outcome of an independent complaints and grievance scheme (ICGS) investigation into allegations of harassment and drug use. He told the Mail on Sunday he is quitting because he feels he was denied a fair hearing by the watchdog over the claims that he made unwanted advances to two women. LibDem candidate Sarah Dyke has arrived at the Somerton and Frome count – and she looks pretty happy: Politico’s London deputy editor Dan Bloom has rounded up the spin ahead of tonight’s results from the Tories, Labour and the Liberal Democrats: Sky News deputy political editor Sam Coates says it “seems clear” that the LibDems will win Somerton and Frome tonight. We may have confirmation (or not) of that in 30 minutes’ time. If the Liberal Democrats win in Somerton and Frome, the Guardian’s Sammy Gecsoyler tells me, Ed Davey will become the first leader of any party since Paddy Ashdown in the 1990s to win four by-elections Only a fool would predict the result in Selby, but it’s late and I have just had a can of full fat Coke so I will say that it is looking pretty good for Labour in the piles of ballot papers I’ve seen piling up. Still no obvious signs of jubilation in the Labour enclave of the leisure centre canteen, but they don’t look depressed either. Time will tell. Crime also came up as a key issue in Uxbridge and South Ruislip and Shadow justice secretary Steve Reed says Danny Beales, the Labour candidate, has already delivered for the local community after a campaign to stop the closure of the local police station was successful. “People will say they just don’t see the peace on the streets anymore,” he says. “It doesn’t show much confidence, I think, on the part of the Conservative Party, they’re trying to avoid the top issue facing the nation.” He said it was humbling to hear people who have never voted Labour are prepared to put their trust in Labour. “Just three and a half years after our worst defeat, what a vindication of Keir Starmer’s leadership and where he’s taken our party and how he’s rebuilding trust with people who never would have envisaged themselves voting [for the] Labour party.” Shadow justice secretary Steve Reed says he was cautiously hopeful for Labour’s chances in the byelection in Uxbridge and South Ruislip after being met with a warm reception on doorsteps today, but said he is not going to call it ahead of the count. People were concerned about the cost of living, crime and Hillingdon Hospital, which is “in a state of dilapidation”, Reed says, despite the conservatives focus on the Ulez. “There are all sorts of people that have been raising Ulez, but certainly the conservatives have tried to run the entire campaign as if this was about a single issue, but it isn’t,” Reed says. “The issue that’s been coming up the most on the doorsteps today, just like for the whole of the five weeks that I’ve been involved, is the cost of living.” Reed said people’s household budgets are really “pressed” at the moment and that many say they are worried about losing their homes. “You’ve got problems like that that are directly attributable to the chaos that the government created when they crashed the economy last autumn with the mini budgets and interest rates spiralling and effectively baked in a Tory mortgage premium into people’s repayments. “They are furious when the government has done that to them because they feel utterly betrayed by a government that they hoped was on their site as they tried to build a home for themselves or for their families.” The declaration in Somerton and Frome could be made at 2am, much earlier than expected, Sky News reports. It is partly because voter turnout was so low – just 44.23% of voters cast a ballot. It is currently just after 1am BST. In case you missed it: Labour chairwoman Anneliese Dodds played down expectations after the polls closed, calling them “incredibly challenging elections” for the party. She also told BBC Newsnight: “Whatever the result one thing is very clear, and it’s been clear to me when I’ve been speaking with people on the doorstep that there will be people in this election who will be voting Labour for the first time. “They can see that Keir Starmer has turned the Labour Party around, that the Labour Party is in the service of working people. “And I think that will definitely be the case whatever the eventual result from these byelections.” Liberal Democrats are not backing down on that Somerton and Frome result: The Somerton and Frome turnout of 44.23% was 31.4 percentage points lower than in 2019. Labour sources say “there are grounds for optimism in Selby,” Sky News deputy political editor Sam Coates has just said. Conservative MP Andrew Jones said the result in the Selby and Ainsty constituency – which the Conservatives won by more than 20,000 votes in 2019 – would be “close”. Asked who might win, he told BBC Newsnight: “Well, who knows? We think it’s going to be very close.” He said it felt like an “individual” byelection, as he hinted at frustration on the doors over the decision of Nigel Adams to quit as an MP and trigger a poll. “This has felt more local, more personal. I think that’s been caused by the reason the by-election is taking place, but I think it’ll be close.” He also urged colleagues to get behind Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in the wake of the by-elections. “I think the public know full well that the nation is facing challenging times and internationally these are challenging times. “So I think the message would be, we’ve just got to get our head down, work and get through this period. “I’ve not felt any sense that the Labour Party was pulling people into them. I’ve sensed a sense of frustration, frustration particularly in the cause of this by-election. “The sitting MP walking away has been a sense of disappointment and that’s putting it quite mildly.” Voter turnout in the Somerton and Frome byelection was 44.23%. Ballots are still being counted in Somerton and Frome but spirits are high among the Liberal Democrats in the counting hall. “We are confident we have got a decisive victory tonight,” Christine Jardine, the Liberal Democrat MP for Edinburgh West, told the Guardian. “If you look at what is happening here tonight, what has happened in the other by-elections that we have won in this parliament, people are unhappy with the Conservatives, they are unhappy with the way they are managing the economy, they are unhappy with mortgage rates, they are unhappy with inflation. In this part of the world they can’t get a GP, they want change.” “This could be a significant night for British politics, its a very significant night for us. The conservatives are in trouble in all these by-elections tonight. What we are seeing is people saying enough is enough, people want change,” Jardine said. “Tonight shows we are back in a strength and a power to be reckoned with in this part of the country again.” When asked what change mean if they voted for the Liberal Democrats, Jardine said: “It would mean a change of government in the country. It would mean there is a strong voice in parliament for communities. “We believe in decision making at a local level. We believe in essential things like building the right houses in the right places. We want to see people getting GP appointments in time. We want to see the NHS improve. We want to see improvements in education.” In case you’re just joining us: less than two hours after polls closed, the Liberal Democrats claimed they had “romped home” in Somerton &amp; Frome, overturning a Tory majority of more than 19,000. While Labour and the Tories attempted to manage expectations in Uxbridge &amp; South Ruislip and Selby &amp; Ainsty. A triple defeat for the Tories would heap pressure on the Prime Minister ahead of a general election expected next year. the Lib Dems were jubilant. A Lib Dem spokesman said: “We’ve not just won, we’ve romped home in Somerton and Frome. “The Conservative vote is in freefall.” Party leader Sir Ed Davey joked: “I think we’re going to need a bigger tractor.” Voter turnout in Uxbridge and South Ruislip, Boris Johnson’s former West London constituency, voter turnout was 46.23%, according to Britain Elects – 17.3% less than in 2019. We’re two hours into the count in the glamorous surrounds of Selby Leisure Centre and no one yet seems confident of victory. I’ve been to many counts over the years and even this early into the night you can tell already if it’s going to be a landslide. Party activists attempt to keep poker faces but they can’t hide their delight if it looks like they are going to romp to victory. There is no badly suppressed glee on show here yet. Just nervous faces as ballot verification continues. A local Labour source who was present the last time a Labour candidate won in Selby — John Grogan, who scraped in with 467 votes in 2005, only to lose in 2010 after boundary changes — said: “It’s hard to tell but it looks ok.” The Guardian’s North of England editor, Helen Pidd, is at the count in Selby. More from her in a moment – but she says neither the Tories nor Labour seem confident yet. Despite the more than 20,000 Labour would need to win Selby – which would be the largest numerical overturned by Labour ever in the party’s history, according to number-crunchers at poll aggregator Britain Elects – some commentators are confident that they’ve done it. Yorkshire Party Deputy Chair David Herdson, formerly a Conservative, says Labour will win “comfortably”. In Boris Johnson’s former West London constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip, candidates wait with bated breath as all of the ballot boxes are in and counting has begun. There are 17 hopefuls in the running, many focusing their campaign on London mayor Sadiq Khan’s plans to extend the ultra-low emission zone (ULEZ). Despite the number of candidates, many expect the race will go to Labour or the Conservatives, who have held the seat since the boundary was created. Conservative candidate Steve Tuckwell hopes to retain the seat, won by over 7,200 votes in 2019. He has called the by-election a “referendum on ULEZ”. The Hillingdon councillor claims many residents in the heavily-car reliant constituency will out of pocket if ULEZ goes ahead. Former charity worker, Danny Beales is running for Labour. Born in Hillingdon Hospital, the Camden councillor has stressed his local roots and is keen to win people over with his pledges to improve the hospital and put more money into the pockets of local people. There are three seats up for grabs in the byelections. Should the Conservatives lose all three, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak could become the first prime minister since Harold Wilson in 1968 to lose a trio of byelections in a single day. Here are the seats: Uxbridge and South Ruislip, on the fringes of London: Boris Johnson’s seat. Labour is the favourite to win. The Tory majority in 2019 was by just 7,210 votes. Selby and Ainsty, in Yorkshire in the north of England: Labour would need to defeat the Tories by more than 20,000 votes here. According to Britain Elects, this would be the largest numerical overturned by Labour ever in the party’s history. Somerton and Frome, southwest England. The Liberal Democrats are so confident of their win that they declared it tonight two hours after polls closed. That is not an official declaration. The 2019 Tory majority is 19,213 votes. Hello, this is Helen Sullivan joining you for our rolling coverage of the UK byelection. The LibDems have already declared victory in Somerton and Frome, but this is by no means an official result –just, to use their words “loudly confident”. It is currently midnight in the UK – this is when we may have the final results: 2am BST or later for Uxbridge and South Ruislip 3-4am BST for Somerton and Frome 3-6am BST for Selby and Ainsty Stay tuned as we take in the stakes, the votes and the best commentary and analysis. You can find me on Twitter @helenrsullivan – send me questions, charts, pictures of your dogs outside polling stations and anything else you think our readers might find interesting. The turnout in the Uxbridge and South Ruislip by-election was 46.23%, PA reports. The Liberal Democrats have claimed they have won the Somerton and Frome byelection. The official result is not expected to be declared for a few hours yet. A Lib Dem spokesman said: “We’ve not just won, we’ve romped home in Somerton and Frome. “The Conservative vote is in free-fall.” Bill Esterton, Labour MP for Sefton Central in Merseyside, also reports a positive response on the doorstep in Selby today, though stops short of predicting a Tory defeat. He tweeted: “I met a number of lifelong Tory voters who were voting Labour in Selby today. Whether that’s enough for us to win, I don’t know, but it points to a close result in a constituency that we’ve not won before. Good luck @Mather_Keir.” A confident tweet from Lib Dem leader Ed Davey. Davey had launched the party’s election campaign by riding in a tractor in Berkhamsted as it smashed down a stack of Tory blue hay bales. Labour chair Anneliese Dodds played down expectations after the polls closed, calling them “incredibly challenging elections” for the party. She told BBC Newsnight: “Whatever the result one thing is very clear, and it’s been clear to me when I’ve been speaking with people on the doorstep, that there will be people in this election who will be voting Labour for the first time. “They can see that Keir Starmer has turned the Labour Party around, that the Labour party is in the service of working people. “And I think that will definitely be the case whatever the eventual result from these byelections.” Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine said her party was “quietly confident” about victory in Somerton and Frome. The party is tipped for victory in the byelection and Jardine told BBC Newsnight that success would be “huge”. “I don’t want to go counting any chickens too early, but we are confident tonight,” she said. “We’ve had a very positive response on the doors and I think I would say quietly confident, though we’re not being too quiet about it. “We are confident that we’re going to see a result in our favour tonight.” In an email to Lib Dem supporters, the party’s leader, Sir Ed Davey, said of Somerton and Frome: “We’re on for another historic result.” He added: “I’m confident we will win big tonight.” I’m reporting from Selby, where Labour MPs think they may just pull off a victory for the ages by overturning the Conservatives’ 20,137 majority. Kate Osborne, the MP for Jarrow in the north-east, was out campaigning today and told me: “It was really positive on the doorstep. “I didn’t speak to a single person who said they were voting Conservative but spoke to many who were turning to Labour for the first time and one who hadn’t voted Labour for 20+ years. “I asked if it was local or national issues that were influencing their vote and nearly all said both and that they were fed up with a government that weren’t listening and didn’t care. So I’m hopeful we will take it.” The Lib Dem MP Christine Jardine said: “If we succeed in overturning the huge 19,000 majority in Somerton and Frome, in what should be a safe Conservative seat, it would mark a watershed moment for the Liberal Democrats. “It would prove yet again that in vast swathes of the country, from Somerset to Surrey, the best way to get rid of this Conservative government is to vote for the Liberal Democrats.” A Labour party spokesperson said: “It’s going to be some time before we get any results. But what we do know is that none of these seats have ever had a Labour MP before, so they were always going to be a challenge. “We didn’t even win Uxbridge in 1997 and to win Selby and Ainsty would require us to overturn the biggest majority in our history. “So while we don’t know if we’ve made it over the line, it’s clear that Keir Starmer’s leadership of a changed Labour party, back in the service of working people, has seen voters put their trust in us – many for the first time.” A Conservative party spokesperson said: “There’s no doubt that this was always going to be a very challenging set of byelections, especially given the circumstances in which they were brought about. “We have to wait for the results to come in, but byelections are rarely won by governing parties and they are rarely good indicators of general election performance. “Across all of these campaigns we have heard zero enthusiasm for Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour party and their lack of answers. “We now need to redouble our efforts earning back the trust of voters by delivering on our plan to halve inflation, grow the economy, reduce debt, cut waiting lists and stop the boats.” The prime minister has acknowledged that holding the three seats, including Boris Johnson’s former constituency, will be a “tough battle”. For Labour, winning the Uxbridge and South Ruislip seat vacated by Johnson and the Selby and Ainsty constituency formerly held by his ally Nigel Adams would be a major boost for Sir Keir Starmer. In Somerton and Frome, in a contest triggered by the resignation of scandal-hit David Warburton, the Liberal Democrats hope to add to a series of eye-catching recent byelection victories. While Johnson only held his seat with a majority of 7,210 as he led the party to a national landslide in 2019, the Tories had a cushion of around 20,000 votes in the other two constituencies, so losses would increase Tory pressure on Sunak. The prime minister could attempt to reset his administration with a cabinet reshuffle in the wake of the contests – defence secretary Ben Wallace has already signalled he will exit the government so there is a vacancy to be filled – although No 10 has publicly insisted there are no plans for a shake-up. Sunak would need to decide whether the benefits of freshening up his team at this stage would be outweighed by the risk of it being perceived as a panicked response to an electoral setback. In Uxbridge and South Ruislip, Labour’s Danny Beales hopes to defeat the Tory Steve Tuckwell, although rows over the Mayor of London’s decision to extend the ultra-low emission zone may cost Labour votes. In Selby and Ainsty, 25-year-old Keir Mather will become the new Baby of the House if he wins for Labour, with Tory Claire Holmes trying to retain the seat for her party. Somerton and Frome has Sarah Dyke hoping to win for the Liberal Democrats, while Faye Purbrick wants to ensure it stays Conservative. The polls have now closed in the byelections to choose a new MP in Somerton and Frome, Uxbridge and South Ruislip and Selby and Ainsty. Voters had been able to cast their ballots from 7am on Thursday. If the Conservatives suffer three defeats, Rishi Sunak could become the first prime minister since Harold Wilson in 1968 to lose a trio of byelections in a single day. We are in the last few minutes of voting in three byelections in England in a significant test of Rishi Sunak’s premiership. They are being held in the south-western Tory stronghold of Somerton and Frome in Somerset, Boris Johnson’s old seat in the west London suburbs Uxbridge and South Ruislip and Selby and Ainsty, North Yorkshire, which was triggered by Nigel Adams’s resignation last month.\n",
      "politics\/live\/2023\/jul\/20\/byelections-conservatives-labour-rishi-sunak-keir-starmer-uk-politics-latest-news We’re closing this live blog shortly, but will be back again from 10pm tonight to cover the results of the three byelections. Here’s a roundup of the key developments from the day: Polls opened this morning in three parliamentary seats where byelections are being held, with Rishi Sunak braced for an electoral test of his premiership. Voters have been able to cast their ballots from 7am in the south-western Tory stronghold of Somerton and Frome, Boris Johnson’s old seat in the west London suburbs Uxbridge and South Ruislip, as well as Selby and Ainsty in North Yorkshire. Ministers will lay out their final year of legislation at King Charles’ first king’s speech in November, the government has confirmed. Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House of Commons, said on Thursday the king’s speech will take place on 7 November, in what is likely to be the last such speech before a general election. Lobbying rules will be toughened up across Whitehall in a long-awaited response by ministers to issues raised by the Greensill scandal, the Guardian has learned. Government departments will be forced to release more information about meetings with lobbyists and extend current requirements for disclosure to phone and video calls, sources say. Rishi Sunak has criticised the European Union’s “regrettable choice of words” after it appeared to have endorsed the name Argentina uses for the Falkland Islands. A diplomatic row erupted after the EU referred to the islands as “Islas Malvinas” in a declaration jointly signed with Argentina and other Latin American countries. The ongoing Stormont stalemate is “totally unsustainable”, the Sinn Féin vice-president, Michelle O’Neill, has said. Following a meeting with the Northern Ireland secretary, Chris Heaton-Harris, at Hillsborough Castle, O’Neil said engagement would continue, but stressed it had to be meaningful. Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng received about £400 in severance pay for every day they were in office, according to government accounts published on Thursday. The former prime minister and former chancellor each received more than £16,000 on leaving their jobs after just a few weeks, the Treasury’s annual report shows, while Tom Scholar, the department’s most senior civil servant, received £457,000 after being sacked by Truss.

The government’s sweeping and controversial asylum reforms have become law as the number of people crossing the Channel in small boats topped 14,000 for the year so far, PA news reports. The illegal migration bill has become an Act of Parliament after being given royal assent, deputy speaker Sir Roger Gale announced in the Commons on Thursday afternoon. It comes as Channel crossings for the year to date reached a provisional total of 14,071, after 297 people were recorded making the journey on Wednesday. The total number of migrant crossings for 2023 so far is still lower than the more than 15,000 arrivals recorded this time last year. Crossings continued on Thursday amid calm weather conditions at sea. Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng received about £400 in severance pay for every day they were in office, according to government accounts published on Thursday. The former prime minister and former chancellor each received more than £16,000 on leaving their jobs after just a few weeks, the Treasury’s annual report shows, while Tom Scholar, the department’s most senior civil servant, received £457,000 after being sacked by Truss. The figures are contained in a series of annual reports from across government, which also show that Boris Johnson was given a payout of £18,660 after quitting as prime minister. Truss and her allies saw Scholar, who was sacked on her first day in office, as representative of orthodox Treasury thinking, which they were determined to overhaul as part of their plan to bring in much lower UK tax rates. Meanwhile the Department for Transport’s accounts show that Grant Shapps received £16,876 after quitting as transport secretary in September, even though he returned to government as home secretary six weeks later. He is now energy secretary. Rishi Sunak, however, who spent just over three months out of government between quitting as chancellor and becoming prime minister, handed back his payout of the same amount. Labour criticised Johnson and Truss for taking their payments after resigning, the former after a series of ethics scandals and the latter amid economic turmoil created by her government’s fiscal policies. UK mortgage rates rocketed after the Truss government’s mini-budget last September, and have not returned to the same level since. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said: After the mess they left our country in, they should be hanging their heads in embarrassment, not walking away with an enormous payoff. At a time when people up and down the country are struggling to pay their mortgages and put food on the table, it shows a staggering lack of shame for Johnson and Truss to accept this money, but is exactly what we’ve come to expect from a bunch of Tories who only care about themselves.

This from PA Media: Following a meeting with the Northern Ireland secretary, Chris Heaton-Harris, at Hillsborough Castle, the Sinn Féin vice-president, Michelle O’Neil, said engagement would continue, but stressed it had to be meaningful and lead to the restoration of the devolved power-sharing institutions. Heaton-Harris is concluding a round of talks with party leaders in the latest attempt to break the Stormont stalemate. The assembly has been in flux for more than a year amid DUP protest action over the Northern Ireland protocol. The Windsor framework was agreed by the EU and UK earlier this year as a way to reduce red tape on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. But the DUP has insisted it will not return to Stormont until the UK government provides further legislative assurances around Northern Ireland’s place within the UK internal market. Senior civil servants have been left running Stormont departments and having to make substantial cuts following a budget set by Heaton-Harris. After the meeting, O’Neill said the British and Irish governments had to do more to bring Stormont back. She said: We have just had our meeting with the secretary of state and we have made it very clear to him that the current position is totally unsustainable, this vacuum isn’t good enough, all it is serving is to punish the public. O’Neill added: Whilst people within the DUP take themselves off on summer holidays, workers and families are left struggling and worrying about how they are going to deal with the cost-of-living issues. We have impressed upon the secretary of state that both himself, the British government and the Irish government must do more; this position just isn’t tenable. We need to see action, the public rightly expect that everybody will work together. We have heard from the secretary of state that they intend to be engaged over the summer, but there is a difference between engagement, and engagement which is actually meaningful and leads to a restoration of the executive. Heaton-Harris met earlier this week with the DUP, Alliance party and the SDLP in London. The DUP leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, said after his meeting on Wednesday the “ball is in the government’s court” with regards to action which would see the restoration of the Stormont power-sharing arrangements. Donaldson said there had so far been a “lack of meaningful action” from Westminster in addressing his concerns over post-Brexit trading arrangements. Heaton-Harris has been pressing the parties on their plans for a costed programme for government for any incoming executive. Rishi Sunak has criticised the European Union’s “regrettable choice of words” after it appeared to have endorsed the name Argentina uses for the Falkland Islands. A diplomatic row erupted after the EU referred to the islands as “Islas Malvinas” in a declaration jointly signed with Argentina and other Latin American countries, PA Media reports. Downing Street said any suggestion that the EU would recognise Argentina’s claims on the Falklands would have been “entirely unacceptable”, as it welcomed a subsequent clarification that EU countries have not in fact changed their position on their status. The initial statement, published on Tuesday after a summit between EU nations and the Celac bloc of Latin American and Caribbean states, said: Regarding the question of sovereignty over the Islas Malvinas \/ Falkland Islands, the European Union took note of Celac’s historical position based on the importance of dialogue and respect for international law in the peaceful solution of disputes. British diplomats reportedly complained about the wording, which Argentina’s president, Alberto Fernandez, appeared to hail on Twitter as support for his country’s long-standing “claim to sovereignty” over the Falklands. In a statement, the EU foreign affairs spokesman, Peter Stano, said: The EU member states have not changed their views and positions concerning the Falklands\/Islas Malvinas. The EU is not in a situation to express any position on the Falklands\/Islas Malvinas, as there is not any council discussion on this matter. Sunak’s official spokesman told reporters on Thursday: The prime minister’s view is that it would have been entirely unacceptable for the EU to question the Falkland Islanders’ right to decide their own future. To be clear, the Falkland Islands are British, that was the choice of the islanders themselves. The EU has rightly now clarified that their position on the Falklands has not changed after their regrettable choice of words. And just as a reminder, in the 2013 referendum, 99.8% of islanders voted to be part of the UK family. It’s a position supported by international law and the UN charter which is binding on all UN members. And we will continue to defend the Falklands’ right to self-determination in all international forums and have called on the EU to respect the democratic rights of the Falkland Islands. He added: The concern is any suggestion that EU states would recognise Argentina’s claims on the Falklands, which they have now clarified is incorrect. The islands were the subject of a war in 1982 which killed 255 British service personnel, three islanders and 649 Argentinian personnel. Lobbying rules will be toughened up across Whitehall in a long-awaited response by ministers to issues raised by the Greensill scandal, the Guardian has learned. Government departments will be forced to release more information about meetings with lobbyists and extend current requirements for disclosure to phone and video calls, sources say. Private emails, as well as WhatsApps and texts on personal phones that are used to discuss government business, will also now need to be declared, and senior civil servants will have to comply with the new rules. The changes come nearly two years after a major report was published following the Greensill lobbying scandal, involving a multinational supply chain finance firm, the former prime minister David Cameron, serving ministers and top officials. Nineteen reforms were proposed by Nigel Boardman, a corporate lawyer who was commissioned by the government to conduct an independent investigation and published his findings in August 2021. In its response, the government will commit to improving the quality of departments’ transparency disclosures, which cover meetings, gifts and hospitality, and are meant to guard against any perception of improper or secretive lobbying. Declarations will be aimed to be published monthly instead of quarterly under the plans to be announced later this week. Read the full story here: The controversial sacking of a top Treasury civil servant, Sir Tom Scholar, cost the government £457,000 in compensation, PA Media reports. The department’s annual accounts reveal Scholar, who was dismissed as permanent secretary when Liz Truss came to power in September 2022, received a £335,000 severance payment along with £122,000 in annual leave adjustments, payment in lieu of notice and other payments. The accounts also show the extent of severance payments made to ministers in the wake of last year’s mass resignations. Among those to receive severance payments was Chris Pincher, who resigned as deputy chief whip in June 2022 over allegations he groped two men at the Carlton Club. Pincher received £7,920 in severance. The former prime ministers Truss and Boris Johnson received £18,660 each after resigning, while the former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng received £16,876. The education secretary, Gillian Keegan, has confirmed that the controversial guidance to schools on trans pupils will now be delayed. Rishi Sunak had promised the guidance would be published before the end of the school year but it has been beset by ministerial in-fighting and legal wrangles. Keegan did not give any hint of when the guidance would now appear. In a written statement, Keegan said: It is vital that the guidance we publish gives clarity for schools and colleges and reassurance for parents. So, we have made the decision to allow more time – to speak to teachers, parents, lawyers and other stakeholders – in order to ensure this guidance meets the high expectations that these groups rightly have for it. The Law Society has said the illegal migration bill, expected to be given royal assent today, will be unworkable. Lubna Shuja, the president of the independent body for solicitors in England and Wales, said: We have been clear from the start that this legislation threatens to undermine the rule of law and access to justice. Whilst the act will soon come into force on paper, it will be unworkable in practice because it doesn’t provide solutions to the asylum backlog, and there isn’t capacity in the legal aid sector to provide the immigration advice needed. The Rwanda removal agreement has been ruled unlawful and is subject to an appeal in the supreme court. Even if that appeal proves successful, there are no other removal agreements in place. Rwanda alone would not be able to accept anywhere near the number of people who will be scheduled for ‘removal’. A growing number of people will be left in limbo as they cannot be removed, and they cannot claim asylum. The cost to the taxpayer will continue to increase as the individuals left in limbo are housed in various accommodation indefinitely. Ministers will lay out their final year of legislation at King Charles’ first king’s speech in November, the government has confirmed. Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House of Commons, said on Thursday the king’s speech will take place on 7 November, in what is likely to be the last such speech before a general election. The event will not only give the government a final chance to set the legislative agenda before that election but will also give the king his first chance to attend a state opening of parliament as monarch. Nigel Farage has praised a “swift” intervention by government ministers after reports that new laws could be drawn up to stop banks closing customers’ accounts because they disagree with their political views. The former Ukip leader said MPs were “beginning to realise that this system is coming for them as well” after his bank accounts were closed by Coutts, he says because his views “did not align with” its values. Ministers are considering legislation to protect free speech by threatening banks with losing their licences if they blacklist people with controversial views, according to the Times. Farage said it was “one of the swiftest interventions I’ve seen by government for many, many years”, and suggested it was a problem that had been “building up for years and years and years”. He told PA media: Every MP will know of constituents, small businessmen and women, who’ve literally been shut down by their banks with no reason given whatsoever. I also think that because of the politically exposed persons (PEP) rule, I think they’re beginning to realise that this system is coming for them as well. Those designated a PEP are typically political representatives and their family members, whose accounts can be treated with extra due diligence by financial institutions. Farage claimed there was “a real sense of anger” among the public, who bailed out banks during the 2008 financial crisis, that now such banks could “treat us with contempt”. The closure of Farage’s accounts sparked outrage among senior Tory MPs, who have put pressure on Coutts and its owner, NatWest. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, intervened in the row on Wednesday to say it was “wrong” and that “no one should be barred from using basic services for their political views”. Read more here: A senior Conservative MP has apologised and deleted a video in which he praised the Taliban and credited them with improving safety in Afghanistan. Tobias Ellwood said he was “sorry for my poor communication” after his actions outraged fellow Tory MPs and military veterans, and an attempt was launched to challenge his role as chair of the Commons defence select committee. In a tweet and accompanying video, Ellwood described Afghanistan as a “country transformed” and talked up the group that seized power in August 2021, claiming “security has vastly improved, corruption is down and the opium trade has all but disappeared”. Following the backlash, Ellwood said: The last couple of days have probably been the most miserable as a member of parliament. I got it wrong. He called the row a Twitter “storm” and said he stood by criticisms in the video about Britain’s lack of engagement with Afghanistan’s new leadership since the chaotic exit of western countries’ armed forces from Kabul nearly two years ago. But Ellwood used a TV interview to repeatedly apologise, and said the video “could have been much better done”. “It’s important to put your hand up and acknowledge errors, however well intentioned,” the Bournemouth East MP and former army captain told TalkTV. Read the full story here: The Rail, Maritime and Transport union general secretary, Mick Lynch, has accused the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, of a “dilution of traditional Labour positions” and “taking the side of the Conservatives” over the two-child benefit cap. Lynch told Sky News on Thursday: It’s not just our members, we’d like him to show that he supports the trade unions, that he supports working people who are struggling, and we think some of the stuff that we’re hearing is a dilution of traditional Labour positions and even the positions that he himself adopted when he was elected as leader. So the stuff about the two-child cap is not really good enough; it’s taking the side of the Conservatives, it’s taking the side of austerity. Lynch said Starmer needs to show that he is a progressive Labour politician and that if he wants to win working-class votes and wants the support of the trade unions, then “he might want to start saying things that we can agree with”. He continued: I’m hoping that we’ll get a new deal for workers, the repeal of many of these anti-trade union laws that restrict our rights and our freedoms, and that he shows that in terms of funding public services like education, health, care for our elders and addressing the housing crisis that we’ve got in this country that he can do something positive in favour of working people. If he does that then more people will support him, if he doesn’t then some people might conclude … they may as well have the Tories because there’s not much difference between them. I don’t think that’s true. I think it’s in our interest to get rid of this government, but he’s got to show some distinction and some distinguishing policies that set him out as different and as a radical person pushing for change. Staff working for MPs need better HR access and a more supportive culture in parliament, but the system through which they are directly employed by members does not need to change, a report by a committee of MPs has concluded. The speaker’s conference on the employment conditions of members’ staff, chaired by Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons speaker, was set up last year after a wave of stories about sexual harassment and bullying in parliament. There was particular concern that staff working directly for MPs, as opposed to those centrally employed by parliament, were vulnerable because the HR practices and working culture were directly set by the MP, who was also their employer. Before the inquiry, Hoyle called for a change to this system, suggesting the idea of setting up an outside employer, meaning staff would have independent input into their careers and concerns. But the report, produced by a cross-party group of 16 MPs, led by Hoyle, said the problems faced by staff were “not inherently related to the identity of the employer”, and that changing the employer would be expensive, time consuming, and “ultimately a blunt instrument”. They said: We conclude that the nature of the work of an MP, and the close working arrangements and personal loyalty between members and their staff mean that members should continue to be the employers of their staff. The report, which will be debated in the Commons before it is implemented, sets out other proposals, including universal access to professional HR, and reforms to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, which has a significant role in the contracts and salaries of MPs’ staff. More widely, the MPs said, there was a need for “a culture which recognises and values the work that [MPs’ staff] do and makes these staff feel part of the wider parliamentary community”. Rishi Sunak told MPs at a meeting of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers on the eve of the polls on Wednesday night that they faced a “tough battle” in what were seen as safe seats for his party. The prime minister told them that governing parties rarely win byelections but urged the MPs to unite in the face of any defeat as he pledged to “throw everything” at winning the next general election, PA Media reports. Labour hopes to snatch Uxbridge and South Ruislip, which was Boris Johnson’s seat until he quit, and Selby and Ainsty - vacated by his ally Nigel Adams’ resignation. The Liberal Democrats are eyeing victory in the contest in Somerton and Frome that was triggered by David Warburton quitting after admitting cocaine use amid allegations of sexual harassment. Losses for the Tories in all of the seats would be the first time in 55 years that a government has been defeated in three byelections on the same day. On Wednesday evening, Sunak was understood to have told his MPs: In the coming months, I am going to set out more of what I would do if I had a full term. I was recently described as a full-spectrum, modern Conservative and you are going to see that in the programme I lay out. Sunak pledged to show the public “who is really on their side”, adding: “And that is what will propel us to victory.” Sunak told the meeting. When we come back in September we have a choice to make, all of us. Do we come together and throw everything at winning the next election or not? I’ve made my choice, I’m all in with you to win. I promise you we can do this but we can only do it together as one team. The Tory backbencher Jonathan Gullis told reporters outside the meeting that the problem is “apathetic Conservative voters” rather than the public’s support for the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer. He said Sunak told them “what we already know, which is it’s going to be a tough battle” in the byelections. Tory MPs at the meeting said he did not address suggestions that he could spring a Cabinet reshuffle on Friday in an attempt to reset his premiership. During a visit to Warwickshire, Sunak told reporters asking whether he would shake up his top team that “you would never expect me to comment on things like that” – in what was clearly not a denial. He welcomed a fall in the rate of inflation as proof his government’s plans were working. The prime minister’s press secretary acknowledged it would be tough for the Tories to hold the three seats on Thursday. She said: Byelections, for incumbent governments, are very difficult, that is the nature of them. The election that the Conservative party is most focused on is the general election. Polls have opened in three parliamentary seats where byelections are being held, with Rishi Sunak braced for an electoral test of his premiership. The Conservative-held constituencies are being targeted by Labour and the Liberal Democrats, who hope to overturn large majorities and send Tory MPs off into the summer recess nervous about their own political futures come the general election. Voters have been able to cast their ballots from 7am in the south-western Tory stronghold of Somerton and Frome, Boris Johnson’s old seat in the west London suburbs Uxbridge and South Ruislip, as well as Selby and Ainsty in North Yorkshire. Sunak was privately downcast on Wednesday afternoon about the his party’s electoral prospects, in part given the nature of why the contests were triggered. Johnson stood down to avoid being suspended from parliament over a report that found he misled MPs over Partygate. Nigel Adams quit after being passed over for a peerage. And David Warbuton, an MP in Somerset since 2015, quit after being investigated over claims of harassment and drug use. On top of the circumstances of the byelections being called, Sunak’s party is also polling poorly, nationally. At a behind-closed-doors meeting of Tory backbenchers on the eve of the byelections, MPs said Sunak appeared to acknowledge the results would be “tough”. If the Conservatives are trounced, Sunak could become the first prime minister since Harold Wilson in 1968 to lose three byelections in a single day. I will be looking after the politics blog today.

      "politics\/live\/2023\/jul\/19\/two-child-benefit-cap-labour-economic-inheritance-rachel-reeves-pmqs-rishi-sunak-conservatives-uk-politics-latest Rishi Sunak has refused to rule out having a government reshuffle on Friday. The Conservatives fear they will lose three byelections tomorrow, including in two seats where they had majorities of around 20,000 in 2019, and there is considerable speculation that Sunak may respond by bringing forward a reshuffle originally scheduled for September. (See 3.26pm.) Rishi Sunak and Ben Wallace have formally apologised to the Commons for the decades-long ban on LGBT people serving in the UK armed forces, after the publication of a government-commissioned review. UK inflation fell further than expected in June to 7.9% amid a sharp fall in petrol prices, easing forecasts for how aggressively the Bank of England will raise interest rates over the coming year. The Conservatives have selected Susan Hall as their candidate for next year’s London mayoral election, with the strongly pro-Boris Johnson, Donald Trump-supporting assembly member likely to be seen as an outsider to defeat Sadiq Khan. Nick Macpherson, the former permanent secretary at the Treasury, has joined those criticising Coutts for the way it has treated Nigel Farage. In an interview with LBC’s Tonight with Andrew Marr, Macpherson said: I think this is a worrying development. I also am worried that the bank had commented on Mr Farage’s income and wealth in public, at least it appeared to brief newspapers last week or the week before. And I think the government is responding to wider unease amongst all of us. Getting a good service out of your bank is difficult enough at the best of times, but if they’re just going to make, on the face of it, fairly arbitrary decisions about your beliefs or politics, I think that is quite a dangerous development. Rishi Sunak is addressing Tory MPs at a private meeting of the Conservative 1922 Committee. The Mirror’s Lizzy Buchan says the traditional table banging that greeted his arrival was rather over the top. Without being in the room, it is hard to judge what this means. Maybe it was a sign that Tory MPs think he is doing brilliantly. Or maybe it was because they think it’s all going pear-shaped, but they feel under a duty to cheer him up. At PMQs Rishi Sunak was twice asked about Nigel Farage having his bank account closed by Coutts. (See 10.22am and 10.44am.) In response, he said people should not lose access to banking services because of what they said, but he did not sound overly-outraged about what had happened. (See 12.28pm and 12.37pm.) Subsequently, in a post on Twitter, Sunak firmed up his criticism. “Not right” became “wrong”. Sunak said: This is wrong. No one should be barred from using basic services for their political views. Free speech is the cornerstone of our democracy. The Conservatives have complained to the Evening Standard about its “contemptible” front page coverage of the selection of Susan Hall as the Tory candidate to be the capital’s mayor, PA Media reports. Nickie Aiken, the Conservative party’s deputy chair, said the selection of the full-page picture of the London assembly member was “clear mockery”, suggesting there was a “whiff of misogyny”. The accompanying headline asked “And the winner is?”, with further text suggesting that Labour incumbent Sadiq Khan is “odds-on to seal third victory”. Tory party chairman Greg Hands backed Aiken’s complaint to Standard editor Dylan Jones, saying the coverage was “extremely disappointing”. In her letter shared on Twitter, Aiken said: I am writing to you to express my sincere disappointment in your front page today. Your choice of photo of Susan Hall is a clear mockery, and it is contemptible, especially as the first female candidate for London mayor from either of the two main parties. In his pooled interview at the Jaguar Land Rover HQ, Rishi Sunak was also asked when the guidance for schools on how to deal with trans pupils would be issued. It was due this week, but has reportedly been delayed because No 10 and Kemi Badenoch, the equalities minister, are pushing for restrictive guidance that would not comply with the Equality Act. (See 11.49am.) Sunak replied: This is a really complex and sensitive issue because it affects the wellbeing of our children, and it’s important that we get it right given those complexities and sensitivities. I am committed to bringing forward that guidance. But I want to make sure that we’ve taken the time to go through it properly, and when we do bring it forward, it will be well thought through. Rishi Sunak has said it was not just taxpayer money that enticed Tata to announce a new £4bn battery factory in the UK which will create thousands of jobs. Speaking at the Jaguar Land Rover HQ in Warwick, he said: When I was chancellor, I set up the automotive transformation fund, which was always there to provide targeted investment in strategic industries where we thought it would make sense. But what is crucial about an investment like this is it’s not just going to be about that, it’s going to be about the quality of the workforce that we have here, the quality of our infrastructure, the road and rail connections, the approach to regulation, the competitiveness of our tax regime, which we have changed to make it more attractive for businesses to invest. Downing Street has confirmed that the government has offered subsidies to the Tata Group, the owner of Jaguar Land Rover, to secure the investment. But it has not yet said how much money is involved. (See 2.26pm.) Rishi Sunak has refused to rule out holding a reshuffle later this week. With speculation growing that a long-planned reshuffle will take place on Friday, immediately after the three byelections the Tories are expected to lose, instead of in September, Sunak was asked this afternoon on a visit in Warwickshire if he would rule out such a move. He replied: You would never expect me to comment on things like that. What I’m determined to do is just deliver on the priorities that I set out for the country – halve inflation, grow the economy, reduce debt, cut waiting lists and stop the boats – today what we saw with the inflation figures is that our plan is working. In fact, prime ministers are happy to rule out imminent reshuffles when it suits them. Aubrey Allegretti has a good account of why a reshuffle seems increasingly likely. He quotes a government source saying No 10 has been asking for resources “only used during reshuffles”. That sounds like a reference to the whiteboard Downing Street uses to show who might go where. Rishi Sunak has given his backing to Susan Hall, elected today as the Tory candidate for London mayor, while not endorsing some of her views. Speaking at the post-PMQs lobby briefing, the PM’s press secretary said Hall had Sunak’s “full support”. But, when asked if Sunak, like Hall, was a supporter of Liz Truss’s mini-budget last year, the press secretary said: [Sunak] has made the point that unfunded tax cuts and increased borrowing would fuel inflation. Since he has been prime minister, he has taken a different approach and has done the right thing, and you can see from the statistics today that the plan is working. Asked whether Sunak thought Hall was right to compare Donald Trump supporters storming the Capitol to remainers refusing to accept the result of the Brexit referendum, the press secretary said: “I don’t think the prime minister would characterise it in that way.” And asked if Sunak agreed with Hall that Boris Johnson was an “awesome” prime minister, the press secretary said: The prime minister has spoken about the many successes of the previous prime minister, including the rollout of the vaccine, getting Brexit done and his staunch support for Ukraine. Asked if Hall would be a liability to the Conservative party, the press secretary replied: No. She has shown great commitment to bettering London with the Conservatives and highlighting the many failures of Sadiq Khan, including his desire to charge people £12.50 a day – as the prime minister said – just to visit their GP. Britain’s counter-terrorism strategy needs to do more work on the “violent trend” emerging from so-called incel (involuntary celibate) culture, Suella Braverman, the home secretary, has said. She was responding to Plymouth MP Luke Pollard, who linked the actions of the killer behind the 2021 Plymouth shootings to incel culture and violent misogyny and questioned why the trend currently fell out of the scope of Prevent, which aims to identify would-be terrorists. There was only one mention of the incel threat in the government’s update to Contest, the UK’s counter-terrorism strategy, which was published yesterday and was the subject of an urgent question in the Commons after PMQs. The Contest update said: It is possible that violent adherents to movements and subcultures, such as Involuntary Celibacy (incels), could meet the threshold of terrorist intent or action, should the threat or use of serious violence be used to influence the government, or to intimidate the public. Bravermen offered to meet with Pollard to discuss what further steps could be taken, telling him: Incel culture is not strictly within the Contest apparatus if you like but it does need work. I readily accept this a violent trend. It is a radicalising influence. It is promoting a culture that is totally at odds with a free and safe democratic society that we all love and want to cherish. I am very happy to speak to him about what further steps we could do. At the post-PMQs lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson refused to say what the government was spending in subsidies to bring the Tata Group’s gigafactory to the UK. Asked about claims taxpayer support for the project could amount to £500m, or even £1bn, the spokesperson said: Some of this stuff is commercially sensitive, it’s not in the UK’s interests to get into all the detail when negotiating with companies, but what shouldn’t be lost is the massive investment into the UK – £4bn, 4,000 direct jobs, thousands more indirect jobs. Details would eventually emerge “as part of the regular transparency data”, he said. But he also pointed out that the government had committed £850m to an automotive transformation fund. He went on: In general, we are acting in line with our approach. We have the automotive transformation fund to develop these sorts of supply chains and unlock private investment in gigafactories such as this one. The spokesperson said the use of public money was “an efficient way to drive massive investment into the UK, not only to help with net zero but to create jobs”. Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, is making a statement to MPs about the review, chaired by Lord Etherton, about the impact of the ban on LGBT people serving in the military before the year 2000. The report says compensation should be paid to people affected, with the total being paid out capped at £50m. It says: An appropriate financial award should be made to affected veterans notwithstanding the expiry of litigation time limits. The government’s overall exposure should be capped at £50m. In his statement Wallace repeated the apology issued by Sunak. He said: I was struck by one particular quote in the report from a veteran who said: ‘I don’t feel like I’m a veteran, I’ve never asked for help, I don’t feel like my service was recognised.’ Today we want to say to all those ex-soldiers, sailors and aviators, many now in retirement: you are one of us, you belong in our community and in choosing to put yourself in harm’s way for the good of your colleagues, your community and country, you have proven yourselves the best of us. I say again to the veterans’ community I’m deeply sorry for what happened to you. The very tolerance and values of western democracy that we expected you to fight for, we denied to you, it was profoundly wrong. I am determined as defence secretary, and as a veteran, to do all I can do today to right those historic wrongs so that you can once again take pride in your service and inspire future generations to follow in your footsteps. Wallace said that the government in principle accepted “the vast majority” of the recommendations in the report, although he said it was still considering them. One of the recommendations was that the PM should deliver an apology in parliament. Earlier I said Sunak did not have to deliver the apology at PMQs, but, having now read the recommendation, I think it would have been embarrassing for him if he had ignored it. The last PMQs before the summer recess matters a bit more than usual because, in normal circumstances, if a leader does badly, they can make up for it a week later. But if you flop just before the summer adjournment, you cannot redeem yourself until September, and your MPs will spend the summer with a reminder of your uselessness fresh in the memory. With that in mind, Keir Starmer should be feeling very comfortable this afternoon. Even those former advisers involved in the unlikely, even bonkers, leadership challenge plot described by the i this week would probably have to concede that he did a good job. There were plenty of reasons why Starmer won this comfortably. He started with a conventional, simple question-that-involves-having-to-admit-something-embarrassing, and this made a decent point about hospital waiting lists, and he needled Rishi Sunak with a question about non-dom status. Much more memorable, though, were two jibes about Sunak missing PMs twice in a row, at least one of which sounded spontaneous, and both of which were funny. Pointing out that Sunak had got his age wrong too was a clear hit, not least because it does make you wonder why they can’t add up in No 10. Starmer’s date of birth is not a secret; it’s on Wikipedia. What was much more important, though, was Starmer’s decision to attack the NHS workforce plan on the grounds that the government has not explained how it will be funded. This is what he said when he raised the point for the second time. When [Sunak] said the workforce plan was fully costed, I have never seen the chancellor more bewildered. It’s less than a year since his party crashed the economy with their unfunded spending commitments and he hasn’t learnt a thing. So, let me ask it another way: is his uncosted spending coming from more tax rises, more cuts, or is it just the latest promise to fall from the Tories’ magic money tree? In response, Sunak said the autumn statement would show where the money was coming from, which half-confirmed Starmer’s point. As of now, it is not clear where the funding is coming from. When opposition parties are weak or nervous, they stick to familiar territory. When they are on the ascendant, they attack on issues supposedly owned by their rivals. The Conservatives have in the past suggested they want to fight the election on economic responsibility, but Starmer and his colleagues have now in effect declared: “Bring it on”, with Rachel Reeves trying to outperform George Osborne on fiscal responsibility, Lucy Powell only yesterday appropriating “no money left” as an argument and now Starmer branding the Tories as the party of the magic money tree. The economics of Labour’s positioning may be highly questionable. But the politics are clear; Starmer is hijacking electoral territory where the Tories thought they were impregnable. Sunak had a difficult PMQs but it could have been a lot worse. He is probably about to lose three byelections, and his approval ratings have hit their lowest level, according to YouGov, since he became PM. In these circumstances, the fact that he could sort of hold his own, and the fact that his MPs did not turn on him, must count as a bonus. Sunak’s main line of attack was to challenge Starmer to say whether or not he thinks that hospital consultants deserve a higher pay rise than they are getting. In the context of PMQs, this is a weak ploy, because is not Starmer’s job to answer questions, and at least twice the speaker reprimanded the PM for going “off topic”. But that does not mean these questions don’t have salience. Starmer can avoid them at PMQs, and not in an interview studio. What was also interesting was Sunak’s unlikely emergence as a gay rights champion. He did not have to announce the apology to LGBT veterans at PMQs, and he condemned conversion practices unexpected strongly in response to a question from Alicia Kearns. (See 12.32pm.) Maybe this is just an attempt to quash claims that the government’s trans guidance for schools (see 11.49am) will mark the start of an ugly culture war campaign, but even if you doubt his sincerity, it is interesting that he felt the need to present his liberal credentials like this. UPDATE: The final paragraph probably overstates the significance of Sunak’s decision to issue his apology to LGBT veterans at PMQs. He did not have to do it, but the Etherton review did recommend an apology by the PM in parliament, and it would have been embarrassing for Sunak to ignore this. However, the report did not specify how the apology should be worded. Sunak chose to describe the ban as “an appalling failure of the British state”. (See 12.03pm.) Rishi Sunak has been forced to respond to questions about his expenses declaration over the funding of private jet travel to Tory events after Labour challenged him at prime minister’s questions about “why his story keeps changing”. It comes after the Guardian reported that he was facing transparency questions over the travel and thousands of pounds in Conservative party donations after they were recorded as coming from a small company linked to a multimillionaire businessman. Last week, he changed his expenses declaration over the funding. In the third change for the declaration, it now names the donor of £38,500 to pay for air travel by the prime minister and staff as Akhil Tripathi, a British-Indian medical tech entrepreneur who made a fortune from an anti-snoring device. At PMQs the Labour MP Neil Coyle asked him: Every single member of this house is required by law to confirm the true source of a donation before it is accepted or declared, so can the prime minister tell us if he followed all the rules all the time before he took thirty eight and a half thousand pounds of free air travel on 28 April and if so, why does his story keep changing about who paid? Sunak replied: All donations are declared in the normal way and as the honourable gentleman knows if there are administrative changes to that they are quickly corrected. Carla Lockhart (DUP) asks about support for children with cancer. Sunak says he can imagine how difficult it is for families with a child with cancer. He will look at the issue Lockhart has raised, he says. And that’s it. PMQs is over. David Davis (Con) says NatWest’s customers should be worried about what happened to Nigel Farage. (NatWest owns Coutts). He says banks should be required to say how many accounts they have closed for similar reasons. Sunak says the government is continuing to look at this issue. UPDATE: Sunak said: I know that [Davis] has spoken to the chancellor about this issue, and that he will continue to have those conversations. In the short term, having consulted on the payment service regulations, we intend to crack down on that practice by toughening the rules around account closures. In the meantime, the Financial Ombudsman Service is available for people to make complaints to. Lee Anderson, the Tory deputy chair, asks about Keir Starmer’s stance on the two-child benefit cap. Sunak says he does not think anyone believes Starmer supports the policy he is now backing. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, says Sunak has no responsibility for what Starmer does. Barry Sheerman (Lab) says John Major has condemned Brexit as a catastrophic decision. Does Sunak agree? Sunak says it was seven years ago. He says since the UK left the single market, the economy has grown faster than Germany’s. Alicia Kearns (Con) asks if the government is still committed to a ban on conversion practices. Sunak says “conversion therapy” is an “abhorrent practice”. He says the equalities minster will update MPs on what is happening in due course. UPDATE: Kearns said: Conversion therapy is quackery packaged up by bigots seeking to promote their hate and to profit from it. On 19 January, a minister promised at the dispatch box to bring forward a ban against conversion therapy and ensure that pre-legislative scrutiny was completed before the end of this parliamentary term. How does [Sunak] plan to continue that? And Sunak replied: I agree that conversion therapy is an abhorrent practice, and we need to do everything we can to stamp it out wherever we see it. [Kemi Badenoch, the equalities minister] will continue to keep the house updated on her progress. Mark Francois (Con) says 457 members of the armed forces were killed in Afghanistan. He says he was stunned to see a video posted by Tobias Ellwood, the Tory chair of the defence committee, praising the Taliban government. Francois says this was “silly and naive”. He asks Sunak to condemn it. Sunak pays tribute to servicemen and women. The government will continue to call out human rights abuses, he says. But he says the government also has dialogue with regimes – without condoning what they do, he says. He says he will look at the case Francois mentioned. Jacob Rees-Mogg (Con) asks if there will be an inquiry into the cancellation of a bank account by a bank with the government as a shareholder. He seems to be referring to the Nigel Farage case, although he does not name him. Sunak says people should not have their accounts closed for exercising the right to free speech. The rules are being tightened, to stop this happening, he says. In the meantime, people can complain to the ombudsman, he says. UPDATE: Sunak said: It would not be right if financial services were being denied to anyone exercising their right to lawful free speech. Our new Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 puts in place new measures to ensure that politically exposed persons are being treated in an appropriate and proportionate manner, and having consulted on the payments services regulations, we are in the process of cracking down on that practice by tightening the rules around account closures. But in the meantime, any individual can complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service, which has the power to direct a bank to reopen their account. Sunak says the government has delivered the number one ask of the BMA, lifting the cap on pensions contributions. Doctors should get back to work, he says. Greg Clark (Con) asks about the gigafactory announcement, and asks if the government will bring more such factories to the UK. Sunak says this is one of the biggest investments in the car industry in the UK. Dame Diana Johnson (Lab) asks why Sunak has been summoned to give evidence to the infected blood inquiry next week. Sunak says the scandal should never have happened. He is due to give evidence shortly, so it would be inappropriate to say more now, he says. Shailesh Vara (Con) says, if Labour favours economic migration, it should say so. He suggests young men arriving on small boats are not genuine asylum seekers. (In fact, based on the number who actually do got their asylum applications considered, a majority of them are.) Sunak says Vara is right. He says Labour does not have a plan to deal with illegal immigration. Stephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster, says the two-child benefit cap has left 250,000 children in poverty. Does the PM take comfort from Labour’s support for it? Sunak says he welcomes Labour’s support for it. But Keir Starmer has never kept a promise he has made, he says. Flynn says Scots expect child poverty from the Tories. But not from Labour. A shiver is running along the Labour frontbench, he says, looking for a spine to go up. Sunak says the best route out of poverty is through work. He says the government will reduce child poverty. He does not want to see any child grow up in poverty. Starmer says he is 60, not 61. He asks about the “40 new hospitals”. But there are not 40, they are not new, and many are not hospitals, he says. Sunak claims 40 new hospitals are being built. Referring to Hillingdon hospital (which serves Uxbridge), he says Labour wants to charge people visiting a hospital. He is talking about the Ulez extension, a key issue in tomorrow’s Uxbridge byelection. Starmer asks if Sunak is so committed to non-dom status that he won’t let the government raise money for the NHS by getting rid of it, as Labour would. Sunak says Labour has promised to spend the non-dom money on five different things. He says he wants people to study maths until 18. Maybe, in Starmer’s case, they should be studying it until they are 61, he says. He says Labour did set out plans for the workforce. But Labour’s plans did not cover retention of staff and NHS reform, he says. Starmer says Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, looked “bewildered” when Sunak said the plan was fully funded. Where is it coming from? The magic money tree? Sunak says when the autumn statement is published, it will show the plan is fully funded. He says, while Labour MPs are “back on the picket lines”, Starmer refuses to take a position. Starmer should “stop taking inspiration from his friends outside and unglue himself from the fence”. Starmer says Sunak has been away from PMQs for so long he has forgotten how it works. He says Sunak nicked his NHS staffing plan from Labour. But, unlike Labour, Sunak has not said how he would pay for it. “Where is the money coming from?” Sunak says the plan is fully funded. And it was welcomed by 43 NHS stakeholders, he says. He starts quoting figures about what the plan will achieve. A&amp;E waiting times in England are the best for two years. But in Wales NHS waiting times are the worst in the UK, he says. Starmer says we do not get any more answers from Sunak when he is here than when he is not here. We know the answer, he says. (It is about 7.5m). Why is the government failing more patients than ever before? Sunak says Starmer did not answer the question. If Starmer looked at what is happening, he would see the plans are working. Waits of one and a half years have been virtually eliminated. Ambulance waiting times are falling. But it has all been held up by industrial action in the NHS. Does Starmer agree doctors should accept the recommendations of the pay review bodies. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, tells Sunak the opposition asks the questions. Keir Starmer welcomes the apology from Sunak. He says a constituent affected by it is in the chamber to hear what Sunak said. There is more detail about the apology here. He says the NHS waiting list was 7.2 million when Sunak took office. What is the figure today? Sunak says cutting the waiting list has been affected by the strike action. Does Starmer agree consultants and junior doctors should accept the government’s pay deal? Sajid Javid, the former health secretary, asks when the suicide prevention strategy will be published. Sunak says it will come later this year. He says he knows how much this matters to Javid because of his brother. Rishi Sunak starts by saying the ban on LGBT people serving in the military until 2000 was a stain on the country. He says a report out today makes this clear. He goes on: Today, on behalf of the British state, I apologise. UPDATE: Sunak said: The ban on LGBT people serving in our military until the year 2000 was an appalling failure of the British state decades behind the law of this land. As today’s report makes clear, in that period many endured the most horrific sexual abuse and violence, homophobic bullying and harassment, all while bravely serving this country. Today, on behalf of the British state, I apologise. I hope all those affected will be able to feel proud parts of the veteran community that has done so much to keep our country safe. PMQs is starting soon. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. Government guidance for schools in England on how to deal with pupils who want to transition has been delayed because No 10 and Kemi Badenoch, the equalities minister, have been pushing for a tough version that would be unlawful under the Equalities Act, Steven Swinford reports in a story for the Times. Swinford says: The draft guidance stated that children should be allowed to socially transition with the consent of their parents, meaning that they could choose another pronoun or name and wear the uniform of the opposite sex. But the government then commissioned legal advice from Victoria Prentis, the attorney general, about whether a ban on social transitioning in schools was possible. Last week she concluded that such a move would be unlawful and said that the government would need to pass new legislation if it wanted to go further … A Whitehall source said that No 10 and Badenoch had put forward a series of proposals to strengthen the guidance. The strongest — and a reflection of the government’s concerns — was a blanket ban on social transitioning … Prentis said that a blanket ban would be unlawful because the Equalities Act states that gender reassignment is a “protected characteristic”, regardless of age. In a thread on Twitter, ITV’s Paul Brand says this illustrates how uneasy Rishi Sunak is dealing with “culture war” issues. Keir Starmer has joined mourners in London for the funeral of Margaret McDonagh, Labour’s first female general secretary, PA Media reports. PA says: Lady McDonagh died in June aged 61 and was hailed for her key role in Labour’s 1997 landslide election victory. Her sister Siobhain McDonagh is the current Labour MP for Mitcham and Morden in south London. Figures from across the party gathered for the service, including former prime ministers Sir Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Other faces from the New Labour era, including Lord Mandelson, attended the Mass at St Boniface RC Church in Mitcham, alongside current shadow cabinet members including Emily Thornberry, Yvette Cooper, Ed Miliband and David Lammy. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, was also in attendance. My colleague Aubrey Allegretti says the SNP has been distributing mugs to journalists at Westminster suggesting “controls on family sizes” is now Labour policy. So it is not hard to work out what Stephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminter, will be raising at PMQs. The head of MI6 has urged Russians angry at Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine to spy for the UK, PA Media reports. Speaking in Prague, Sir Richard Moore said that while artificial intelligence (AI) was being used to help target the Kremlin’s war machine, technology would never replace human agents. Moore said: There are many Russians today who are silently appalled by the sight of their armed forces pulverising Ukrainian cities, expelling innocent families from their homes and kidnapping thousands of children. They are watching in horror as their soldiers ravage a kindred country. They know in their hearts that Putin’s case for attacking a fellow Slavic nation is fraudulent, a miasma of lies and fantasy. Moore said “many Russians are wrestling with the same dilemmas and the same tugs of conscience” as their predecessors did in 1968 when Soviet tanks crushed the Prague spring uprisings. He went on: I invite them to do what others have already done this past 18 months and join hands with us. Our door is always open. We will handle their offers of help with the discretion and professionalism for which my service is famed. Their secrets will always be safe with us. And together we will work to bring the bloodshed to an end. Just Stop Oil protesters staged a protest on Westminster Bridge this morning. Chris Philp, the policing minister, has welcomed the intervention by the police, who cleared the road after eight minutes. He posted a tweet saying: Glad the Police cleared the road in 8 mins. Westminster Bridge leads to a major A&amp;E department at St Thomas’s Hospital. JSO are deliberately preventing people getting to hospital (and work, school etc) because they can’t win the argument by normal democratic means Nigel Farage, the former leader of Ukip and the Brexit party, is encouraging people to read the full set of documents about him he obtained from Coutts using a subject access request. (See 10.22am.) They have been published by MailOnline. Farage told PA Media: It is a document that is full of every negative thing that has ever been said about me, it is prejudicial in a way that only the metropolitan elite can do. He also claimed that, if banks were allowed to reject customers because of their views, the UK was heading for Chinese-style authoritarianism. He said: I think that the march of woke corporatism needs to be checked and if it is not then we will finish up with a Chinese-style social credit system. Only those with acceptable views will be able to participate fully in society. I am effectively de-banked. How do I pay my gas bill? What have I done wrong? I haven’t broken the law. I happen to have an opinion on issues that is more popular outside the M25 than it is in inner London postcodes. Susan Hall has been chosen as the Conservative candidate for next year’s London mayoral election, after a turbulent selection process in which a series of early favourites were excluded or stepped down, Peter Walker reports. My colleague Pippa Crerar says Sadiq Khan, the incumbent Labour mayor who will be fighting for an unprecedented third term next year, will be thrilled. Khan’s team view Hall as a “hard-right” figure out of touch with London’s values, she says. A few weeks ago Nigel Farage, the former leader of Ukip and the Brexit party, claimed that his bank account was being closed because of his political views. At first he did not name the bank involved, but as the controversy escalated, with anti-bank stories appearing prominently in the pro-Brexit papers, the elite bank Coutts let it be known that it was closing Farage’s account. The BBC and other news organisations reported that Farage was being told to take his custom elsewhere, not because of his political views, but because there was not enough money in his account. Now Farage has got hold of a document from the bank that suggests that this account was, at the very best, misleading. After making a subject access request, Farage obtained 40 pages of material held by the bank about him, including minutes from a meeting of Coutts’ wealth reputational risk committee. A full account has been published in the Daily Telegraph. According to the Telegraph, the minutes of a meeting of the wealth reputation risk committee held on 17 November 2022 say: The committee did not think continuing to bank NF [Nigel Farage] was compatible with Coutts given his publicly-stated views that were at odds with our position as an inclusive organisation. This was not a political decision but one centred around inclusivity and purpose. There are more details in our version of the story here. The Telegraph also says the committee was told that Farage’s account was “sufficient to retain on a commercial basis” – although the bundle of documents released to Farage also included an email sent in March this year saying his account had been “below commercial criteria for some time”. This morning, responding to the new revelations, Grant Shapps, the energy secretary, said that Coutts’ treatment of Farage had been “disgraceful”. In an interview with Sky News, he said: I think it is absolutely disgraceful. I don’t have to agree with everything Nigel Farage says to recognise that free speech is a very important part of our domestic life. What has happened with some of these banks through this regime, which is known as the PEP [politically exposed persons] regime, or politically exposed people, is really actually scandalous. People shouldn’t have their bank accounts closed because of their political or any other view. And banks shouldn’t be refusing to open accounts on that basis as well. Yet there is a very long-running problem within this country where banks are misapplying the guidance and rules. And not just closing accounts, but refusing to open them in the first place, and that should not be the case. In her Today interview Rachel Reeves said that tackling child poverty was “at the heart” of the document published by Labour earlier this month setting out details of its “breaking down barriers to opportunity” mission. (See 9.31am.) That was not immediately obvious to readers. The document runs to 22 pages, but the phrase “child poverty” only appears three times, in this passage. Child poverty reduction: Dedicated professionals across our education system go above and beyond every day to deliver for our children, but the barriers that too many children face – from the lack of a secure home, to not having books to read or pens to draw with – are not theirs to fix. As part of the Opportunity Mission cross-government task force, we will involve child poverty reduction specialists at the heart of this work. Labour will put a focus on reducing child poverty at the centre of how we secure opportunity for children and young people from every background and every corner of our country. There are three other explicit references to reducing poverty in the document. At the press conference where this was launched, my colleague Peter Walker asked Keir Starmer why poverty reduction did not feature more prominently as a goal. In response, Starmer said that targeting poverty was “the foundation on which these missions sit” and that his government would be “laser-focused on poverty”. Good morning. Yesterday Keir Starmer delivered an uncompromising message, at shadow cabinet and at the Tony Blair Institute conference, to critics in his party unhappy about his declaration that the two-child benefit cap will have to stay. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, was on the Today programme this morning and, while she did not contradict her leader, she presented Labour’s stance in a very different manner. Tackling child poverty would be a priority, she said. She told the programme: Tackling child poverty is in Labour’s DNA. When we were last in government, under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, hundreds of thousands of children and pensioners were lifted out of poverty. Keir Starmer and Bridget Phillipson set out our opportunity mission just a couple of weeks ago. Child poverty was at the heart of that. Reeves made the point in an interview with Nick Robinson during which she also said Labour would have “the most dire economic inheritance of any incoming government”. The party could not promise to do things, like lifting the two-child benefit cap, without having the money to pay for them, Reeves said. When Robinson put it to her that a Labour colleague had said there were six other policies, like axing the two-child cap, that the party would like to implement, but could not afford to, Reeves replied: The truth is there’s more than six things that an incoming Labour government won’t be able to do. We’re going to have the most dire economic inheritance of any incoming government. The level of debt in the UK economy is the same size as everything we produce in the economy on an annual basis. Our interest rates and inflation are a staggering high levels and our economy is barely growing. It’s barely grown these last 13 years … It is our duty to get control of the public finances and ensure we’ve got a stable economy. It’s not a ‘nice to have’, it is the rock of stability upon which all other policies have to be built. There will be nothing in a Labour manifesto there’s not fully costed and fully funded. But Reeves also said this did not mean Labour was not committed to tackling child poverty. That’s when she used the “in Labour’s DNA quote”. Robinson then suggested that Starmer is only saying now he will keep the two-child cap because he wants to sound tough. Do you really think that, when you are in office, you will not be able to get rid of that? Reeves replied: Tackling child poverty is in Labour’s DNA. When we were last in government, under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, hundreds of thousands of children and pensioners were lifted out of poverty. Keir Starmer and Bridget Phillipson set out our opportunity mission just a couple of weeks ago. Child poverty was at the heart of that. That sounded like a very strong hint that, eventually, under Labour, the two-child benefit cap would go. Reeves was giving an interview after the publication of today’s inflation figures. As Richard Partington reports, the headline rate fell further than expected in June, to 7.9%. Graeme Wearden has more on this on his business liveblog. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Richard Moore, head of MI6, does a live Q&amp;A with Anne McElvoy from Politico. 10am: The Conservative party will announce who has been chosen as the party’s candidate for London mayor next year. The two candidates are Susan Hall and Moz Hossain. 10am: Sarah Dines, the safeguarding minister, gives evidence to the Commons home affairs committee about human trafficking. 10am: Counsel for core participants make closing statements on the final day of hearings at the Covid inquiry for module one, dealing with the UK’s preparedness. 12pm: Rishi Sunak faces Keir Starmer in the final PMQs before the summer recess. 1pm: Lucy Frazer, the culture secretary, gives a speech on supporting young people. 3.40pm: James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, takes part in a “fireside chat” at the Aspen security forum in the US. 5pm: Sunak addresses Tory MPs at the 1922 Committee.

      "politics\/2023\/jul\/19\/susan-hall-chosen-as-conservative-candidate-for-london-mayor The Conservatives have selected Susan Hall as their candidate for next year’s London mayoral election, with the strongly pro-Boris Johnson, Donald Trump-supporting assembly member likely to be seen as an outsider to defeat Sadiq Khan. Hall, a member of the London assembly since 2017, and formerly leader of its Conservative group, beat Mozammel Hossain, a barrister with virtually no frontline political experience, in a ballot of Tory members, winning 57% of the vote. The ballot was originally going to be based on a three-person shortlist but the other candidate, the tech entrepreneur and former No 10 adviser Daniel Korski, dropped out after allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards a woman, which he denied. Labour immediately sought to portray Hall as “a hard-right politician who couldn’t be more out of touch with our city and its values”, pointing to her vehement support for Johnson, Liz Truss, and even Trump. An often outspoken character with a robust and active Twitter presence, Hall was criticised by the Conservatives in 2021 for arguing that the deadly storming of the US Capitol by supporters of Trump was the equivalent of UK politicians who opposed Brexit. She vocally supported Trump before his bid for re-election in 2020, and was seen as the choice for the mayoral race by Johnson, for whom she was a loyal backer. Khan and his team are likely to also point to Hall’s vehement support for Truss and her short-lived government, including a tweet after the mini-budget that precipitated a fiscal crisis, saying: “Oh deep joy, a proper #Conservative government”. Her views on immigration may also be problematic in a city known for being more liberal than the UK average, especially on cultural issues, with Hall backing the home secretary, Suella Braverman, over her description of small boat crossings as “an invasion”. Speaking after the announcement, Hall said she was “a low-tax Tory”, which was why she had supported Truss, but that she accepted “things did not go as they should have done”. Rishi Sunak’s press secretary distanced the prime minister from Hall’s views about the Capitol violence, but said she had his full support. The press secretary said Sunak had not met Hall recently, but that “I believe he has” met her in the past. In an immediate hiccup to her campaign, the Conservatives complained to London’s Evening Standard newspaper for putting on its front page a photograph of Hall hoisting her arms in triumph after her win. The photo was “a clear mockery” and “contemptible – especially as [Hall is] the first female candidate for London mayor from either of the two main parties”, Nickie Aiken, a Tory MP and party vice-chair, wrote in a letter to the paper’s editor, Dylan Jones, which she shared on Twitter. Hall had been “heavily encouraged to pose with her arms up in the air” by the paper’s photographer, Aiken said, and did so despite initial reluctance. The Greens have chosen the Hackney councillor Zoë Garbett as their candidate for the election, which takes place in May next year. The Liberal Democrats will choose between a shortlist of the tech industry adviser Rob Blackie and Chris French, a community advocate. While Khan will be viewed as the favourite, Labour will face the obstacles of incumbency in seeking a third term, controversy over his expansion of the ultra-low emission zone to outer boroughs, and a change to the electoral system, which means votes from lower-ranking candidates can no longer be transferred to the top two. Hossain, who grew up amid poverty in Bangladesh and moved to London when he was 21, was seen as Downing Street’s favoured choice. However, as a barrister with virtually no political experience before the mayoral race, he was hugely inexperienced – and was labelled “Mysterious Moz”. The emergence of Hall and Hossain as the only two candidates put to members came after a controversial selection battle in which Paul Scully, the minister for London and the most high-profile candidate vying for the role, was excluded from the shortlist. Another potential frontrunner, Samuel Kasumu, a former adviser on race issues to Johnson’s Downing Street, had failed to make the initial longlist of eight. Korski dropped out of the race after Daisy Goodwin, a novelist and TV producer, alleged that he had put his hand on her breast during a meeting at Downing Street when he was an adviser to David Cameron 10 years ago. Korski said he “categorically” denied the claim, but that it was becoming a distraction to the selection race.\n",
      "politics\/live\/2023\/jul\/17\/two-child-benefit-cap-labour-conservatives-rishi-sunak-education-uk-politics-latest Justine Greening, the Conservative former education secretary, has criticised Rishi Sunak’s plans to limit access to university degrees in England, accusing him of “anti-levelling up in action” if he presses ahead with the policy. Jamie Driscoll, the North of Tyne mayor who has been blocked from being Labour’s representative to contest the north-east mayoralty, has announced that he is resigning from the party to try to run as an independent candidate. Labour MPs and anti-poverty campaigners have attacked Keir Starmer’s commitment to keep the Conservatives’ controversial two-child benefit limit. Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, has signalled that the government is opposed to further concessions to the House of Lords on the illegal migration bill. (See 4.58pm.) He was speaking at the start of a debate after which MPs will vote to overturn a series of amendments passed by the Lords which Jenrick claimed would drive “a coach and horses” through the legislation. The bill will return to the Lords this evening, where peers will have the chance to vote yet again to water down the bill. When the debate on the illegal migration bill finishes in the Commons, there could be up to eight divisions – taking up to two hours. After that the bill will return to the House of Lords, where the voting could go on very late. “The house may sit late,” the Lords schedule says. In the Lords this afternoon the Labour peer Lord Harris of Haringey said the government whips were inflicting a “punishment beating” on peers by timetabling the votes like this. He said: Is it not the case that the way that this is being structured is you like almost a sort of punishment beating for the House of Lords for daring to question a particular piece of legislation? Would it not be better for us to agree that we finish at the normal time tonight then we can consider it at a sensible hour tomorrow [Tuesday]? If the Commons need to consider it again they can either do it if they wish very late at night tomorrow or perhaps can wait until the following day [Wednesday]. In response Lady Williams, the government chief whip, said there was “nothing unusual about this ping-pong process”. In the Commons Robert Jenrick is now winding up his speech. He says it is time for the will of the elected chamber to prevail. In his speech opening this afternoon’s debate Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, confirmed that the government is opposing further concessions to the Lords. He said: The issue now before the house is whether the clearly expressed views of this house, the elected chamber, not just in the vote last week, but throughout the earlier passage of the bill, should prevail. We believe that inaction is not an option, that we must stop boats, and that this bill is a key part of our plan to do just that. The message in the means must be absolutely clear and unambiguous. If you come to the UK illegally you won’t be able to stay here. Instead you’ll be detained and return to your home country or removed to a safe third country. There is simply no point in passing legislation that does not deliver a credible deterrence and provides the means to back it up with effective and swift enforcement powers. We can’t accept amendments that provide for exceptions, qualifications and loopholes which would simply perpetuate the current cycle of delays and endless late and repeated legal challenges to removal. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, asks Robert Jenrick about one of the concessions announced last week relating to how the illegal migration bill deals with people who claim to be victims of modern slavery. One of the aims of the bill is to stop people avoiding deportation by saying they have been a victim of illegal slavery. The government claims this protection is being abused. Last week the government said guidance would be issued saying that, if a person has been a victim since they arrived in the UK and if they agree to cooperate with a UK investigation, they would have the protection currently available to victims of modern slavery. Duncan Smith suggested that it would be better to include this change on the face of the bill, instead of just promising guidance. In response, Jenrick suggested that legislation would contain the risk of loopholes. He implied statutory guidance would be more flexible. Sir Edward Leigh (Con) intervenes. He asks Robert Jenrick if he has seen the comments by Ken Clarke, who is “not a vicious, rightwing creature”, who says he sees no alternative to the bill. And he says Michael Heseltine, another figure seen as being on the Tory left, has spoken about the need to reduce migration. Jenrick says he has seen Clarke’s comments, and agrees with them. In the Commons Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, is now opening the debate on the Lords amendments to the illegal migration bill. He says MPs voted 18 times on Tuesday last week to reverse amendments passed by the Lords. That was a record number of votes in a day, he says. He says the Lords amendments were driving “a coach and horses” through the bill. The government made some “reasonable changes”, he says, and the number of issues dividing the Lords and the Commons has now been “whittled down to nine”. Barges and disused military bases could continue to be used to house asylum seekers under a Labour government until a claims backlog has cleared, the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, has indicated. Cooper made the point during a Q&amp;A after she delivered a speech saying Labour would criminalise the deliberate use of AI chatbots to radicalise and train would-be terrorists. Ben Quinn has the story here. Later this afternoon MPs will debate the latest amendments to the illegal migration bill passed by the House of Lords, in a further round of “ping pong” as the two houses seek to resolve their differences over the bill. At the afternoon lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson said he did not think the government would be offering any further concessions to the Lords on the legislation. Carpenters, bricklayers and roofers are among migrant workers who will be allowed to apply for work visas and get a discount on fees in an effort to fill UK job shortages, PA Media reports. PA says: The Home Office said it was “temporarily easing visa restrictions” for a string of construction roles by adding them to the shortage occupation list. This means foreign workers trained in certain professions qualify for a work visa and are allowed to pay a reduced application fee. The government hopes the move will help boost the economy, “stimulate development” and “attract new talent”, the department said. The announcement comes in the wake of calls from some Tory MPs who urged Rishi Sunak to cut immigration and cut back on temporary visa schemes. Bricklayers, masons, roofers, roof tilers, slaters, carpenters, joiners, plasterers and other “construction and building trades not elsewhere classified” have all been added. Those working in a shortage occupation can be paid 80% of the job’s usual going rate. Back in the Commons, Sir Peter Bottomley (Con) asked Gillian Keegan to consider, when judging what counted as a low-value degree, that religious leaders earn very little, but can contribute greatly to society. Keegan, the education secretary, said she accepted his point. But she said there were some students still earning less than £18,000 a year, five years after graduating, and that this was not acceptable. And Valerie Vaz (Lab) asked Keegan what she meant by a low-value degree. Keegan said the Office fo Students already uses B3 measures to judge courses. It considers how many students continue with a degree, how many complete courses and how many go into a high-skilled job. She said 18 providers were a cause for concern on this basis. And she suggested business and management courses, and computer science courses, needed special attention. She said there was a vast difference in the outcome for people studying these subjects at different universities. Planning for an emerging infectious disease outbreak in the NHS was “woefully inadequate”, the doctors’ union has told the UK Covid inquiry, saying: “We felt so unprepared.” In the final week of the inquiry’s investigation into the UK’s preparedness for the pandemic, the chair of the British Medical Association, Prof Philip Banfield, said it had warned years before the virus hit that a decision to split public health directors from the NHS would “threaten the ability to mount an effective pandemic response”. But when the virus hit, he said: “I’ve never seen doctors so worried.” The UK had prepared for pandemic flu, but the 2019 version of the national risk register also contained a planning assumption for an emerging infectious disease outbreak of 2,000 cases and 200 fatalities. There were only eight beds in four units around the country ready to treat people in those cases, according to evidence to the inquiry from NHS England. Under questioning from a lawyer for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, Banfield agreed this was “woefully inadequate”. The Trades Union Congress revealed that workers were not consulted during pandemic planning and the Health Foundation said not enough money was invested in the NHS to keep pace with demand, with spending £40bn below that of Frances, and social care and public health funding slashed by 12% and 15% per capita respectively. Kate Bell, the deputy general secretary, said the TUC had in 2016 made “an unprecedented series of warnings, raising the alarm about pressures on the NHS”. She went on: There was very clear evidence that the NHS was under pressure in terms of its capacity … but also in terms of staffing levels, and it was having a significant impact on the ability to cope with additional shocks. Gillian Keegan, the education secretary, is making a Commons statement on the plan to limit the number of students studying what the government calls “rip-off” courses in England. Until now the government has not given a clear definition of how it judges if a course is not leading to students getting good jobs. (See 1.15pm.) But Keegan may have given a hint when she told MPs there are 66 higher education providers where fewer than 60% of graduates go on to high-skilled employment, or further study, within 15 months. “This is not acceptable,” she said. Jamie Driscoll has now raised more than £30,000 to fund his campaign to run as an independent candidate for mayor of the north-east next year. That is more than the target he set for fundraising by the end of August (see 1.55pm), and it means he is definitely running. He has confirmed that by tweeting a link to an Elton John song – I’m Still Standing. Momentum, the leftwing Labour group, has said that Keir Starmer and his allies are to blame for the “mess” generated for the party by Jamie Driscoll’s resignation. A Momentum spokesperson said: Keir Starmer’s anti-democratic purge has just cost Labour a popular and effective mayor. By needlessly blocking Jamie Driscoll from running for Labour in the north-east mayoralty he himself helped secure, Starmer’s acolytes have divided the Labour party, denied members and unions a fair say and alienated a sitting mayor who has been delivering for North Tyne on council housing and green jobs. This is a mess entirely of Keir Starmer’s making. To be fair to Starmer and his allies, they don’t seem to regard this as a mess at all. From their point of view, anything that shows voters the party has changed from the Jeremy Corbyn era they seem to regard as a good thing. (See 2.42pm.) Driscoll was never exactly a fully-fledged Corbynite, but he is markedly more leftwing than Starmer, and in the Labour party these days that seems to be enough to kill selection chances. Labour should be able to win the north-east mayoral election next year quite easily because it covers what is mostly Labour territory. A Driscoll candidature will make that harder, and in the past independent candidates have done well in mayoral contests, where individual appeal can trump party loyalty. Ken Livingstone famously won his first mayoral contest in London as an independent, trouncing Labour. But Livingstone was an exceptional figure, who had been a household name in London for 20 years by the time he ran for mayor. Driscoll does not have that status, and he will be up against a Labour machine that still dominates local politics in the north-east. The Labour party has put out a statement suggesting that Jamie Driscoll was blocked from standing in the contest to be the party’s candidate for north-east mayor because he was not good enough. In a statement on Driscoll’s decision to quit the party, a spokesperson said: The Labour party is delighted that local party members have selected Kim McGuinness as our candidate for the north-east mayoral election next year. With Keir Starmer as leader, the Labour party is a changed party, relentlessly focused on delivering for working people, and we make no apologies that Labour candidates are held to the highest standard. The Tories have let our region down, and as Labour mayor, Kim will be the strong voice the north-east deserves. Labour has said Driscoll was blocked because he shared a platform with Ken Loach, the film director who has strongly defended Jeremy Corbyn against the claims that Corbyn tolerated antisemitism in the party. Driscoll has said he was talking to Loach at an arts event, about Loach’s films set in the north-east, and that if that is unacceptable for a Labour figure, the party is in a “dark place”. Jamie Driscoll has already raised almost half of the £25,000 he says he needs by the end of August if he is going to run as an independent in the contest to be north-east mayor, my colleague Owen Jones points out. Driscoll says a full campaign will cost £150,000, but he says if he can get £25,000 by the end of next month, he will definitely stand. (See 1.53pm.) Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, has said that Scottish Labour is opposed to the two-child benefit cap (see 9.35am) and will push Keir Starmer to get rid of it if he wins the next general election. Sarwar told the Daily Record: Scottish Labour policy has not changed. We continue to oppose the two-child limit. We continue to believe that it exacerbates poverty, and we continue to believe that it needs to change. What we recognise is an incoming Labour government will inherit economic carnage and that means we will not be able to do everything we want, and we won’t be able to do everything as fast as we want. But we will continue to press any incoming UK Labour government to move as fast as they can within our fiscal rules to remove this heinous policy. Jamie Driscoll, the North of Tyne mayor, has resigned from the Labour party. He was recently banned from standing in the contest to be the party’s candidate for mayor of the north-east (a new post, including the area covered by the North of Tyne mayoralty, with a wider chunk of the north-east also included), and at the time the decision was seen as one of the most extreme of many recent cases of candidates not wholly aligned with Keir Starmer and his politics being purged from Labour contests on dubious grounds. In a series of tweets, Driscoll says that if he can raise £25,000 for a campaign by the end of August, he will stand as an independent against Labour’s candidate for north-east mayor. He says: I’ve decided to resign from @UKLabour and serve as an Independent Mayor. People are tired of being controlled by Westminster and Party HQs. They want someone to stand up for them. Let the people decide. £25k by end of Aug &amp; I’ll stand as North East Mayorhttps:\/\/gofund.me\/98547c6b The only ‘whip’ should be the people. The North East needs an experienced, independent voice. Even if you don’t live here, this affects you. Our politics is a mess. Millions feel no one speaks for them. Politicians should answer to you, not to party bosses in London HQs. Since my barring by @UKLabour, I’ve received overwhelming support. The cry for me to run as an independent has come from business leaders, community workers, trade unionists and politicians cross party. People have stopped me in the street asking me to run! But I won’t have big party machinery behind me, or a national press office. I’ll need £150k to run a full campaign. If I can raise £25k by the end of August, I’ll run. The decision is yours. There’s more info here This is not a time for faint hearts. It’s a time for bravery. If you back me, I’ll run. If I run, we can win. #ShyBairnsGetNowt. If you want to find out more about me and my vision for the future, you can find out more on my website A reader asks: Who runs the Office for Students? Good question. The chief executive is Susan Lapworth, but the appointment to the OfS that attracted most attention was James Wharton, who was appointed chair in 2021. Wharton was Conservative MP for Stockton South between 2010 and 2017. He was a junior minister for two years, but one of his main achievements as an MP was taking a private member’s bill through the Commons in 2013 proposing a referendum on EU membership. That, and the fact that he helped to manage Boris Johnson’s Tory leadership campaign in 2019 (despite the fact he was no longer an MP), probably help to explain why Johnson made him a peer in 2020. When Wharton was made chair of the OfS, despite having no background in higher education, Labour denounced this as cronyism. UPDATE: A reader points out that Toby Young, the free schools champion and rightwing controversialist, was also on the board of the OfS briefly. But he resigned after his appointment triggered protests. And here is a full summary of that was said at the Downing Street lobby briefing about the government’s plan to limit the number of people studying what are deemed low-value courses in England. No 10 refused to give examples of what it sees as “rip off” courses. Asked to give examples, the PM’s spokesperson said that under the plans it would be for the Office for Students to decide what courses were not value for money. He said the OfS would focus on particular courses, not entire subjects. He said: This is not about specific subjects. We are subject-agnostic when it comes to this. As to how the OfS would decide what courses did not offer value for money, the spokesperson did not give precise details, but he highlighted two criteria that would apply: drop-out rates (“regardless of the subject, you wouldn’t want to see students being signed up to a course where half of the students drop out”, the spokesperson said); and whether the course leads to students getting good jobs. The spokesperson said the “vast majority” of university courses would not be affected by the policy because they were “good quality”. The spokesperson would not say whether Rishi Sunak thought too many students were going to university. Asked if he thought too many people were going to university, the spokesperson said Sunak thought “working to an arbitrary number is not the right approach”. At 3.30pm Gillian Keegan, the education secretary, will make a Commons statement on the plan to restrict student access to what are deemed low-value degrees. There are no urgent questions. No 10 has said some “rip-off” university courses could be closed down under the plans announced by the government today. The government says it wants to impose a limit on the number of students in England who can study courses deemed as poor value for money, either because of their drop-out rates or because they don’t help students get good jobs. But at the No 10 lobby briefing this morning, the PM’s spokesperson said the cap could be as low as zero. He said: In extremis, recruitment limits could be used to prevent any recruitment to a course. The OfS [Office for Students] has powers to suspend a provider’s registration or even remove it from their register if they wish, but it’s up to them to decide the scope and nature of any recruitment. I will post more from the briefing shortly. In his interview for broadcasters this morning Rishi Sunak also paid tribute to Ben Wallace, following the defence secretary’s announcement that he expects to leave cabinet at the next reshuffle and to stand down as an MP at the next election. Asked if he was sorry to see Wallace go, Sunak replied: Of course I am … Ben’s been a great defence secretary. I’ve enjoyed working with him and he’s got a track record he can be very proud of. Sunak also insisted that Wallace’s decision to leave parliament was understandable. He said: [Wallace has] been in politics and public service for a very long time, and, as he said, he wants to be able to spend more time with his family, and as a dad myself I completely understand and sympathise with that. Wallace, who is 53, joins a long list of Conservative MPs, some of whom are quite young, who are standing down at the next election, and this trend is partly explained by the despair they feel about their party’s election prospects. But Wallace has been defence secretary for four years under three prime ministers, making him the longest-serving Conservative in the post since Winston Churchill, and so he has more reason than some of the others for thinking it is time to move on. In his clip for broadcasters this morning Rishi Sunak was mostly asked about the policy the government is billing as a “crackdown on rip off university degrees” in England. Here are the main points. Sunak said the policy partly intended to reinforce the message that “you don’t have to go to university to succeed in life”. He explained: For many people university is the right answer and it does brilliantly, but actually there are a range of people who are being let down by the current system. They’re being taken advantage of with low-quality courses that don’t lead to a job that it makes it worth it, leaves them financially worse-off. That’s what we’re clamping down on today – but, at the same time, making sure that young people have a range of fantastic alternative opportunities, whether that be apprentices or higher technical qualifications, for example. Sunak is only the latest in a long line of senior politicians, from all main parties, who for years have been saying that success in life should not depend on having a good university degree. But generally their children end up going to university anyway, which may be one reason why the message is not cutting through. Sunak brushed aside concerns that the policy would cut revenue for some universities. When this point was put to him, he said what mattered was the “overall financial sustainability” of the university system. He said the policy would make higher education better value for taxpayers. He explained: I think it’s important that the system is also fair for taxpayers, because ultimately as taxpayers that fund the system – and we’ve got a situation at the moment where around half of people who go to university don’t end up paying back the cost of that degree – that costs the taxpayer money. So, we need to make sure the system is not just fair for students and they’re getting the right outcome, but it’s also fair for taxpayers. Part of these reforms clamping down on low-quality courses will improve the overall financial sustainability of the system. And that’s right, right for students, right for the taxpayer. He stressed that it would be for the Office for Students, not the government, to decide what might count as ‘rip off courses”. He said: What the regulator will do is look at a range of different outcomes for courses. So, what kind of jobs are students going on to, do they complete the course, how much do they earn in later life? On the basis of all of that, they’ll be able to figure out ‘well, hang on, that course actually isn’t delivering value for money. It’s letting people down and we should not put students on it because we’re letting them down’. With that information, students can make more informed choices and, at the same time, we’re making it easier for them to find things like apprenticeships. A fresh overtime ban has been announced by train drivers, threatening disruption to services at the height of the summer holidays, PA Media reports. PA says: Members of Aslef at 15 train operating companies will refuse to work overtime from Monday 31 July to Saturday 5 August in the long-running dispute over pay. Drivers launched a week-long overtime ban on Monday which the union warned will “seriously” affect services. Aslef said train companies did not employ enough drivers, which was why they are dependent on rest day working, which the union pointed out was voluntary. The action will affect Avanti West Coast; Chiltern Railways; Cross Country; East Midlands Railway; Greater Anglia; Great Western Railway; GTR Great Northern Thameslink; Island Line; LNER; Northern Trains; Southeastern; Southern\/Gatwick Express; South Western Railway main line; TransPennine Express; and West Midlands Trains. It will be the fourth week-long ban on overtime since May. Commenting on the decision, Mick Whelan, Aslef’s general secretary, said: We don’t want to take this action. We don’t want people to be inconvenienced, but the blame lies with the train companies, and the government which stands behind them, which refuse to sit down and talk to us, and have not made a fair and sensible pay offer to train drivers who have not had one for four years – since 2019 – while prices have soared in that time by more than 12%. The proposal they made on April 26 of 4% with a further rise dependent, in a naked land grab, on drivers giving up terms and conditions for which we have fought, and negotiated, for years was not designed to be accepted. We have not heard a word from the employers since then – not a meeting, not a phone call, not a text message, nor an email – for the last 12 weeks, and we haven’t sat down with the government since January 6. Rishi Sunak has recorded an interview for broadcasters this morning. Among other topics, he was asked about the report from the National Audit Office today saying that the government is not likely to deliver the 40 “new” hospitals promised by Boris Johnson at the time of the last election. Sunak downplayed the NAO findings, saying the report showed that 40 projects were set to be delivered by the end of the decade. He said: I think we will deliver 40 hospitals by 2030 as we committed to do … I think if you look at the report, they do say we actually will deliver 40 hospitals by 2030. But that’s just one of the many things that we’re doing for the health service. The NAO report explains that the 40 hospital projects now on the government’s list for completion by 2030 are not the same as the original 40 announced. Only 32 of those are still on the list covered by this deadline, and only 11 count as “whole new hospitals”, it says. Rishi Sunak has written an article for the Daily Telegraph this morning defending the government’s plan to limit the number of places for students in England on what it calls “rip off degree courses”. In it he argues: Too many of our young people are sold a false dream of going to university only to find they’re enrolled on low-quality courses that don’t offer the skills they need to get a decent job at the end of it. Contrast that with apprenticeships or other vocational routes. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, one in five graduates in this country, about 70,000 every year, would be better off financially if they had not gone to university. And despite having studied for several years, one in three graduates are in a job that doesn’t require them to be degree-educated. Put simply: our young people are being ripped off. They’re being saddled with tens of thousands of pounds of debt from bad degrees that just leave them poorer, and dissuaded from pursuing more vocational options because they are led to believe that university is the only route to success. It’s not fair on them – and it’s not fair on you as taxpayers, forced to pick up a big chunk of the bill despite getting nothing back for our economy. Sunak is referring to this IFS report, published three years ago, saying “one in five students – or about 70,000 every year - would actually have been better off financially had they not gone to university”. But, in interviews this morning, Robert Halfon, the education minister, was unable to name any of the degree courses that will be affected by the new cap. Under the plan, the Office for Students will implement the policy, which will start to apply from the 2024-25 academic year. But Halfon did reject claims that this approach amounted to an attack on arts and humanities courses. When this was put to him, he told Times Radio: That’s absolutely not the case. Because we’re not saying that particular arts courses are going to have limits. It may be that in some universities there are arts courses that are leading to good jobs. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, was also asked about Keir Starmer’s comments on the two-child benefit cap on ITV’s Good Morning Britain. She firmly rejected the claim that Starmer’s decision to say he would keep the cap meant Labour were the same as the Tories. She said: I strongly do think there is a massive difference between Labour and the Tories, who have been in power for 13 years and left us with a country that just feels broken, where everything’s gone backwards, everyone is worse off. Labour is setting out an alternative course. She cited Labour’s plan to introduce breakfast clubs in every primary school in England as one example of what the party would do to address child poverty. An accommodation barge to house 500 asylum seekers has left its berth in Falmouth, Cornwall, and is expected to head to its destination in Portland, Dorset, PA Media reports. PA says: The Bibby Stockholm had been due in Portland a month ago, despite resistance from the local council and Tory MP Richard Drax. But work on the barge had been delayed and it was only this morning that tugs began towing the vessel out of Falmouth harbour. Supermarket bosses will meet Grant Shapps, the energy secretary, today after he pledged to hold “rip-off retailers” to account for charging motorists “sky high” prices for fuel. Kalyeena Makortoff has the story here. In his Inside Politics briefing for the Financial Times, Stephen Bush says that, regardless of what Keir Starmer told Laura Kuenssberg yesterday, a Labour government would end up getting rid of the two-child benefits cap. Bush argues: The Conservatives’ policy — which caps the amount a household can receive in benefits if they have no, or low, earnings — upsets the party’s social liberals, its Christian socialists, its feminists and its pro-welfare tendency  …  Essentially every part of the Labour party hates this policy, which is one reason why almost every major figure in the party is on the record calling the policy “immoral”, “heinous” or “social engineering” or some variation thereof. The only question will be whether a change to the current cap is enforced on the leadership — perhaps by some equivalent of the bill currently working its way through parliament — or if the policy never gets that far. You can see at the moment that Keir Starmer is trying to win, essentially, a doctor’s mandate: that was the subtext of his piece for the Observer this weekend. The short version is “the UK is sick, the disease is low growth, give me a mandate to cure the illness”. And you can see, too, how Labour might find its way around this commitment, whether through spinning its changes to universal credit or pointing out the problems that UK benefits create for growth. Good morning. MPs have got four more days sitting in the Commons before the summer recess starts, but it is not really the moment for Rishi Sunak to start winding down. There are byelections in three Conservative-held seats on Thursday – Boris Johnson’s Uxbridge and South Ruislip, Nigel Adams’ Selby and Ainsty, and David Warburton’s Somerton and Frome – and Tories fear they will lose them all, even though in the latter two the majorities in 2019 were around 20,000. If this does happen, Sunak will be the first PM to lose three byelections in one day since Harold Wilson in 1968 (12 years before Sunak was even born). We got a preview of one possible Tory line to take in the event of a triple drubbing from the Conservative MP Steve Brine on the Westminster Hour last night. Asked about the possibility of defeat in Uxbridge, he said: “It’s another bit of what I call ‘long Boris’, isn’t it?” Long Boris might also part-explain a defeat in Selby, where the byelection is only happening because Adams, a Johnson loyalist, resigned in a huff when his nomination for a peerage was blocked. But if Sunak does lose in all three seats, most commentators, and Tories, will conclude that this is symptomatic of a wider malaise, and not purely the fault of Johnson. With the recess looming, Keir Starmer has his own problems. As Pippa Crerar and Patrick Butler report, the Labour leader is facing criticism because yesterday he said he would keep the two-child benefit cap in place. A new report out today by academics, who have studied the impact of the policy in detail, says the case for scrapping the two-child cap, and the overall benefit cap, is “overwhelming”. It says both policies are causing “extreme hardship” and failing to incentivise claimant families to find more work or limit the number of children they have – supposedly the whole point in the first place. On the two-child cap in particular, the report, which is funded by the Nuffield Foundation and produced by researchers from the Larger Families project, says: Many of the families we interviewed did not know that the two-child limit existed until after their child was born and, in some cases, conception was not a choice, but was the result of failed contraception or an abusive relationship. In other cases, the family was not receiving benefits when the affected child was born, and parents only found out about the restriction when their circumstances later changed as a result of relationship breakdown or job loss. Additionally, while there is an exemption in place for children born as a result of non-consensual conception or within the context of domestic abuse, the majority of the participants eligible for this were not receiving it. As this analysis by Matthew Weaver explains, getting rid of the two-child benefit cap would cost about £1.3bn. This morning Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, defended Starmer’s decision to say Labour would keep it in place, saying the party could only promise things it could afford. She told Sky News: We’ve got to be clear about what we can fund and that’s why Keir Starmer’s set out the position. Because we’ve got to make sure that any policy that we propose, anything that we might want to change, anything we might not like that the Tories have done, we’ve still got to say how we’d fund it. Here is the agenda for the day. Morning: Rishi Sunak is on a visit to a school. 10am: Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, gives a speech on national security. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 2.30pm: Gillian Keegan, the education secretary, takes questions in the Commons. After 3.30pm: An education minister is expected to make a statement to MPs on the plans to cap the number of students who can enrol for “low value” courses in England. After 4.30pm: MPs will debate and vote on the latest Lords amendments to the illegal migration bill. If you want to contact me, do try the “send us a message” feature.

      "politics\/2023\/jul\/14\/robert-jenrick-should-be-ashamed-of-his-lack-of-compassion-for-migrant-children Just when you think Tory politicians have sunk as low as they can go in their attempts to appease the rabid right, they prove you wrong (Robert Jenrick has cartoon murals painted over at children’s asylum centre, 7 July). Robert Jenrick has found a new way to demonstrate his utter lack of empathy, compassion and humanity in ordering Disney scenes to be painted over at a reception centre for children of asylum seekers. Whatever one’s views on immigration and asylum seekers, children should not be used as pawns by politicians of any party. Jenrick should be ashamed. Dr Stephen Pacey North Muskham, Nottinghamshire • The paintings had been done to give comfort to lone children, some as young as nine, terrified after arriving in the UK by small boats. The hostile environment has become so entrenched that some have lost sight of all humanity. We can only hope that the next election sees those seats coloured blue on the electoral map similarly painted over. Alex Orr Edinburgh • In reading recently about British attitudes towards the 4,000 Basque children brought to this country post-Guernica in April 1937, I’ve been struck by clear parallels with the political and moral debate today. While a Tory MP at that time urged the public not to contribute money to the “little Basque devils”, a correspondent from Shipley wrote to a local newspaper in July 1937: “The Spanish children now in England are innocent victims of a war which was not of their seeking. Only a warped judgment would describe as impudent the attempt to feed and clothe these children … All too often the plea ‘charity begins at home’ serves as a cloak for uncharitableness.” Peter Howarth Leeds • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

      "politics\/live\/2023\/jul\/14\/nhs-doctors-strike-conservatives-rishi-sunak-uk-politics-latest-news The prime minister has rejected suggestions that it was unfair for ministers to have agreed a 5% pay rise with more than 1 million NHS staff before offering a higher baseline increase to doctors. Part of the deal struck between ministers and health unions in May saw around 1.3 million eligible staff on the AfC contract – which includes nurses, paramedics, 999 call handlers, midwives, security guards and cleaners – receive a 5% pay rise, backdated to April. A senior cabinet minister has urged health unions to take the government’s pay offer seriously, after union leaders said the proposed deal would drive doctors out of the profession and could lead to further strikes. Gillian Keegan, the education secretary, defended the offer of a 6% pay rise for junior doctors, a day after the government accepted the recommendations of the public sector pay review bodies. The Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has been invited to the UK on an official visit in late autumn, the first such visit by the heir to the Saudi throne since he was accused of masterminding the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post columnist and dissident. Numerous UK ministers have been to Saudi Arabia in the interim, and senior Saudi ministers have also come to the UK, including the foreign minister, Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud. Rishi Sunak continues to trail Keir Starmer in the polls as his personal favourability rating slides further into negative territory. The prime minister’s net favourability rating has fallen to -21, according to a poll published by Ipsos UK on Friday, with 47% of people saying they had an unfavourable view of him, PA Media reported. The immigration minister Robert Jenrick told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that ministers were not planning to make any more compromises, after peers pressed for further changes to the illegal migration bill. Members of the Lords want further concessions on limits to the detention of children, modern slavery protections and the provision of safe and legal routes for refugees to the UK. Rishi Sunak must uphold his £11.6bn climate finance commitment, conservative parliamentarians, including the former net zero tsar, have said. Writing to the prime minister in a cross-party letter, they say recommitting to the target and clearly demonstrating how it would be met would “avoid doing further damage to the UK’s climate leadership, and help to build a safe and more prosperous future”. Pupil absences are at “crisis” level, the education secretary has said, as she endorsed headteachers driving children to school if necessary. Gillian Keegan told Sky News headteachers had a duty to get children to school. Figures released earlier this year showed that about 125,000 pupils last year were severely absent, meaning they were absent more often than they were in classrooms, PA Media reported. The MP Angus MacNeil has had his membership of the SNP suspended after he refused to rejoin the party’s Westminster group. MacNeil, who has often voiced criticism of the SNP leadership, was kicked out of the Westminster group for a week after reportedly clashing with the chief whip, Brendan O’Hara, PA reported. Around 950 workers at Gatwick airport will take eight days of strike action, beginning later this month, in a dispute over pay. Unite said members who carry out roles including baggage handling and check-in would strike. They are employed by ASC, Menzies Aviation, GGS and DHL Services. The workers will strike initially for four days from Friday 28 July to Tuesday 1 August. Then a further four days from Friday 4 August to Tuesday 8 August. Bailiffs raided the Environment Agency yesterday, the Guardian has learned, with staff having to leave for the day. Details about the turmoil at the quango’s Bristol headquarters, Horizon House, are scarce, but the EA has confirmed it happened. A high court judge has ruled that two councils and a local resident can proceed with a legal challenge to the government about whether or not it is lawful to place thousands of asylum seekers on two military bases. West Lindsey district council is challenging the plans to move people into the RAF Scampton site in Lincolnshire, while Braintree district council and a local man, Gabriel Clarke-Holland, are bringing a case over the use of Wethersfield airbase in north Essex, where the Home Office started placing asylum seekers on Wednesday. Plans to construct a road tunnel near Stonehenge have been approved, the Department for Transport (DfT) said. The transport secretary, Mark Harper, has granted a development consent order for the project on the A303 in Wiltshire, PA Media reported. Rail passengers are being warned of disruption to services next week because of fresh industrial action by train drivers and other workers in long-running disputes over pay, jobs and conditions. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) will strike on 20, 22 and 29 July, while drivers in Aslef will ban overtime from 17 to 22 July, PA Media reported. A parliamentary committee is renewing an inquiry into sexism and misogyny in the City after a spate of sexual harassment allegations rocked the business world. MPs on the influential Treasury committee said the inquiry would examine the barriers faced by women in financial services, and determine whether meaningful progress had been made since its last investigation in 2018 raised concerns over the gender pay gap, stigmatisation of working mothers, and an “alpha male” culture. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, and indeed the UK politics live blog for today. Thanks for following along. Plans to construct a road tunnel near Stonehenge have been approved, the Department for Transport (DfT) said. The transport secretary, Mark Harper, has granted a development consent order for the project on the A303 in Wiltshire, PA reported. A DCO previously issued for the £1.7bn scheme was quashed by the high court in July 2021 amid concerns about the environmental impact on the Unesco world heritage site. The plans involve overhauling 8 miles of the A303, including digging a 2-mile tunnel. Every day, from early morning to late at night, lorries pull up at an inconspicuous-looking warehouse located just off the M20 near Lympne in Kent. Less than half an hour by road from both the Port of Dover and the Eurotunnel terminal at Folkestone, trucks loaded with fresh produce come to a facility run by the logistics company PML to have consignments of goods arriving from overseas inspected, cleared for customs and sent on their way. In recent weeks, the site has been kept busy with the arrival of soft fruit such as blueberries and strawberries from Morocco, although the season is drawing to a close as domestic summer produce stocks UK’s supermarket shelves instead. However, a tower of four pallets of Moroccan raspberries, weighing about 1,600kg, are still stored in the warehouse, after failing an inspection by officials because of a suspected fungus. At the moment, PML – which stands for Perishable Movements Ltd – only has approval from the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and HM Revenue and Customs to process goods such as fruit and vegetables, as well as plants, arriving from outside the EU. Downing Street has declined to say whether a formal invitation has been extended to Mohammed bin Salman. “We wouldn’t get into invites for foreign leaders,” said Rishi Sunak’s spokesperson, adding details of such visits would be “set out in the normal way”. They added that the prime minister’s position on the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi was that it was “a terrible crime” and Saudi Arabia “must ensure such an atrocity can never happen again”, pointing to the imposition of sanctions on 20 Saudi nationals who were said to be involved in the murder. However, pressed on whether the order to kill Khashoggi came from the top of the regime, Sunak’s spokesman said: “I haven’t asked him that question directly. I think the government’s position on this has been set out for some time and hasn’t changed.” With a general election approaching, some Conservative ministers fear they won’t just be out of government in 18 months’ time, but ejected from the House of Commons altogether. With that in mind, and talk of a reshuffle next Friday growing, some admit privately they have signalled a desire to move to the backbenches. Doing so allows them to start running the clock down on the ban of up to two years that can be imposed on taking up a private sector job after leaving Whitehall. Whispers about plans by Rishi Sunak to reorganise his top team have percolated through the corridors of parliament for weeks, but senior Tories are now bracing for the axe to start swinging in seven days. The prime minister has rejected suggestions that it was unfair for ministers to have agreed a 5% pay rise with more than 1 million NHS staff before offering a higher baseline increase to doctors. PA reports: Downing Street said it was “wrong” to look at only headline pay rise figures, arguing that one-off bonus payments made to staff on Agenda for Change contracts (AfC) meant their increase in earnings had actually been worth more than a 6% rise. Part of the deal struck between ministers and health unions in May saw around 1.3 million eligible staff on the AfC contract – which includes nurses, paramedics, 999 call handlers, midwives, security guards and cleaners – receive a 5% pay rise, backdated to April. As part of the same deal, those eligible have also started receiving a one-off payment for last year and a so-called NHS backlog bonus for this year, worth between ££1,655 and £3,789 depending on an employee’s pay band. On Thursday, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced he was accepting the recommendation of independent pay bodies for a 6% rise for consultants, along with the same award for England’s striking junior doctors, who are also being offered an additional consolidated £1,250 increase. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) branded ministers’ approach as “highly cavalier” and said the pay award to nurses was “unfair and inadequate”. General secretary Pat Cullen said: “The prime minister will have to explain to over a million outraged NHS workers why they are getting the lowest pay rise in the public sector. “Record numbers of jobs in the NHS are unfilled and the government cannot expect to turn that around when it appears not to value them. “Inflation is not coming down in the way ministers told NHS staff and others it would. For nursing staff, the pay rise they actually rejected is worth increasingly little and being eclipsed now by announcements for other professions.” While more than 100,000 nurses – about 84% who took part in the poll – are said to have voted to continue strikes over pay, the ballot last month fell short of the requirement for the majority of union members to turn out. Downing Street said nurses on AfC contracts were seeing uplifts in pay that went beyond the 5% headline figure. The prime minister’s official spokesman said: “When it comes to the Agenda for Change deal, it would be wrong to look at just the 5% figure because they received a significant non-consolidated award worth between 3.5% and 8.2% of their basic pay. “Through the Agenda for Change deal, we’ve put more money into the pockets of healthcare workers this year than would have been the case with a 6% consolidated rise.” He said the lowest paid AfC staff had seen a pay increase of more than 20% since 2021-22, with nurses £5,000 better off over the past two years. Treasury minister John Glen told MPs on Thursday that the previously agreed deal was worth more than £3,600 for the average nurse or more than £3,700 for the average ambulance worker. Rishi Sunak’s spokesman also highlighted that nurses had received pay rises when other public sector workers had not in order to reward them for their frontline efforts during the Covid-19 pandemic. He added: “We think that is a fair offer, both to recognise the hard work of healthcare workers and for taxpayers. “Unions, including the RCN, recommended it to their members, and the (NHS) Staff Council supported that, so we think it is the right deal for the workforce.” This post was updated after publication to corrected some of the figures relating to the one-off payment to nurses A high court judge has ruled that two councils and a local resident can proceed with a legal challenge to the government about whether or not it is lawful to place thousands of asylum seekers on two military bases. West Lindsey district council is challenging the plans to move people into the RAF Scampton site in Lincolnshire, while Braintree district council and a local man, Gabriel Clarke-Holland, are bringing a case over moves to Wethersfield airbase in north Essex, where the Home Office started placing asylum seekers on Wednesday. A high court challenge earlier this week sought permission for judicial review of this issue. The two councils and Clarke-Holland brought the case against the home secretary and the levelling up secretary. Fifteen grounds were brought forward and three were granted on Friday, including permitted development planning grounds, and equality impact grounds. The first 46 asylum seekers who arrived at Wethersfield on Wednesday were brought from a processing facility in Kent over the weekend after crossing to the UK in small boats. MP Angus MacNeil has had his membership of the SNP suspended after he refused to rejoin the party’s Westminster group. MacNeil, who has often voiced criticism of the SNP leadership, was kicked out of the Westminster group for a week after reportedly clashing with the chief whip, Brendan O’Hara, PA reported. The MP for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Western Isles) later said he would not seek to rejoin the group until at least October, accusing the party of a lack of urgency on its goal of Scottish independence. He said the Scottish government was “utterly clueless about how to pursue independence” since losing the Indyref2 case at the supreme court. MacNeil has now been administratively suspended while the party’s member conduct committee considers his decline of the offer to re-join. An SNP spokesperson said: Angus MacNeil MP was advised by the SNP national secretary on Wednesday that she considered him to be in breach of the party’s code of conduct by his decision to resign from the SNP Westminster parliamentary group. Having acknowledged this, Mr MacNeil did not take up the offer to rejoin the SNP parliamentary group and the matter was, therefore, yesterday referred to the SNP member conduct committee for consideration. MacNeil has represented the constituency since 2005. Bailiffs raided the Environment Agency yesterday, the Guardian has learned, with staff having to leave for the day. Details about the turmoil at the quango’s Bristol headquarters, Horizon House, are scarce, but the EA has confirmed it happened. The agency told the Guardian that no assets were seized, and it will be the subject of further legal action by the EA today. Anyone with more information about this do get in touch at helena.horton@guardian.co.uk. Downing Street said it hoped junior doctors and consultants in England would consider the pay rises offered as it confirmed there will not be further talks on wage increases. The prime minister’s official spokesperson told reporters: We would hope that junior doctors and consultants – on around £120,000 a year – will look at the offer again today and speak to their unions and consider whether it is appropriate for it to keep disrupting patient care in the way they are doing, in light of junior doctors on average (being offered an) 8.8% pay increase and consultants a 6% pay increase. And consultants, of course, are some of the best-paid public sector workers – and indeed public or private sector workers. So it is for them to consider whether it is appropriate. Our position is clear: we have accepted the independently decided recommendation of the pay review body. We are more than happy to talk about wider workforce issues but we won’t be having further talks on pay. Rishi Sunak’s spokesperson said junior doctors were being offered “one of the biggest pay increases across the whole public sector” and that the lowest paid in their ranks were being offered a 10.3% uplift in their pay as part of the package. “And that is on top of their pension contributions, which are far and above those in the private sector,” the No 10 official added. Rail passengers are being warned of disruption to services next week because of fresh industrial action by train drivers and other workers in long running disputes over pay, jobs and conditions. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) will strike on 20, 22 and 29 July, while drivers in Aslef will ban overtime from 17 to 22 July, PA reported. RMT members including station staff, train managers and catering staff will be involved in the action. Passengers were advised to check their travel arrangements in advance as the level of service will vary across the country. The strike action at 14 train companies will see wide variations of services across the country with trains due to start later and finish much earlier than usual. In some areas, only around half of train services will run, while others will have no services at all. Evening services on some lines are likely to be affected on the days before each strike and on the mornings after the action. The overtime ban by drivers in Aslef on 14 train companies will affect train services between 17 and 22 July. A parliamentary committee is renewing an inquiry into sexism and misogyny in the City after a spate of sexual harassment allegations rocked the business world. MPs on the influential Treasury committee said the new inquiry would examine the barriers faced by women in financial services, and determine whether meaningful progress had been made since its last investigation in 2018 raised concerns over the gender pay gap, stigmas against working mothers, and an “alpha male” culture. It will also explore what kind of role City firms, the government and regulators including the Financial Conduct Authority should play in “combating sexual harassment and misogyny”. The inquiry comes after two scandals that have raised serious concerns about abuse and harassment against women in business. Earlier this year the Guardian revealed multiple claims of sexual misconduct at the Confederation of British Industry, which prompted a string of companies to terminate their membership, including Aviva, NatWest, John Lewis and BMW. The Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has been invited to the UK on an official visit in late autumn, the first such visit by the heir to the Saudi throne since he was accused of masterminding the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post columnist and dissident. Numerous UK ministers have been to Saudi Arabia in the interim, and senior Saudi ministers have also come to the UK, including the foreign minister, Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud. Prince Mohammed also spent nearly a week in Paris last month meeting the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and attending a climate finance summit. News of the UK visit, first revealed by the Financial Times, comes as Saudi Arabia tries to end the war in Yemen, and has opened up diplomatic relations with Iran. The US is seeking to persuade Saudi Arabia to also normalise diplomatic relations with Israel, but Riyadh, unlike its Gulf Arab allies the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, is resisting until there is progress on the Palestinian issue. Rishi Sunak must uphold his £11.6bn climate finance commitment, conservative parliamentarians, including the former net zero tsar, have said. Writing to the prime minister in a cross-party letter, they say recommitting to the target and clearly demonstrating how it would be met would “avoid doing further damage to the UK’s climate leadership, and help to build a safe and more prosperous future”. Chris Skidmore, the MP who authored the government’s net zero review, is among 51 parliamentarians, including four Tories, who have written to the prime minister urging him not to let down developing countries. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, who also signed the letter, told the Guardian: The government’s commitment to £11.6bn in climate finance isn’t a ‘nice-to-have’ – it’s an absolutely critical part of the global effort to tackle the accelerating climate emergency, and a solemn promise to the international community that cannot simply be abandoned on a whim. It must be new and additional money, too. Giving with one hand and taking with another, by diverting cash from an already depleted aid budget, won’t help those on the frontline of this crisis. Any backsliding on this commitment would leave any remaining semblance of the UK’s global climate leadership in tatters. In case you missed it earlier, a senior cabinet minister has urged health unions to take the government’s pay offer “seriously”, after union leaders said the proposed deal would drive doctors out of the profession and could lead to further strikes. Gillian Keegan, the education secretary, defended the offer of a 6% pay rise for junior doctors, a day after the government accepted the recommendations of the public sector pay review bodies. Keegan said the pay review bodies had taken into account how much money would be needed to recruit and retain NHS staff without adding to the UK’s stubbornly high inflation rate. The British Medical Association however called the offer “a huge missed opportunity”, while the Royal College of Nursing said it highlighted the unfairness of the separate offer to nurses of 5% plus a one-off payment. Rishi Sunak continues to trail Keir Starmer in the polls as his personal favourability rating slides further into negative territory. The prime minister’s net favourability rating has fallen to -21, according to a poll published by Ipsos UK on Friday, with 47% of people saying they had an unfavourable view of him, PA reported. The figures are Sunak’s worst since he quit as chancellor in July 2022, helping topple Boris Johnson, when Ipsos found 50% of people had an unfavourable view of him. The poll, carried out between 30 June and 3 July, found Labour leader Starmer’s ratings had improved slightly over the past month, with 32% saying they had a favourable view of him and 39% saying they had an unfavourable one. There was more bad news for Sunak when Ipsos asked about the qualities people look for in a prime minister. On the factors people said were most important to them, Sunak received overwhelmingly negative ratings while impressions of Starmer were more mixed. Half of the 1,000 people polled by Ipsos said they had a negative view of Mr Sunak’s policies for dealing with the cost of living and his understanding of the problems facing people in Britain. Immigration minister Robert Jenrick told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that ministers were not planning to make further compromises, after peers pressed for further changes to the Illegal Migration Bill. Members of the Lords want further concessions on limits to the detention of children, modern slavery protections and the provision of safe and legal routes for refugees to the UK. The Lords inflicted a string of fresh defeats on the government this week over the much-criticised Bill, which ministers insist is integral to efforts to tackle small boats crossings in the Channel, PA reported. It means the continuation of the parliamentary tussle over the bill, known as ping-pong, where the legislation is batted between the Lords and Commons, until agreement is reached. The Commons had overturned a raft of earlier revisions by the unelected chamber, despite rebellions by Tory MPs concerned about the flagship reforms. But Jenrick told the BBC that critics of the Bill had not put forward any “credible alternative”, adding: It’s incumbent on those who choose to criticise our approach to provide an alternative. It’s not a serious or grown-up way to conduct a debate to say, ‘well we have concerns about Rwanda’, ‘we don’t like the compliant environment’ – ‘We don’t want this, we don’t want to’, but not to come up with an alternative.” The bill now heads back to the Commons where MPs will consider the latest changes made by peers. Around 950 workers at Gatwick airport will take eight days of strike action beginning later this month in a dispute over pay. Unite said that members who carry out roles including baggage handling and check-in would strike. There are employed by ASC, Menzies Aviation, GGS and DHL Services. The workers will strike initially for four days beginning on Friday 28 July ending on Tuesday 1 August. Then a further four days from Friday 4 August until Tuesday 8 August. The union’s general secretary Sharon Graham said: Our members at Gatwick airport undertake incredibly demanding roles and are essential to keeping the airport and airlines working, yet their employers somehow think it is acceptable to pay them a pittance. As part of Unite’s unyielding focus on the jobs, pay and condition of its members, the union has drawn a line in the sand and is committed to eradicating the scourge of low pay at the airport. Pupil absences are at “crisis” level, the education secretary has said, as she endorsed headteachers driving children to school if necessary. Gillian Keegan told Sky News that headteachers had a “duty” to get children to school. Figures released earlier this year showed that about 125,000 pupils last year were severely absent, effectively meaning they were absent more often than they were in classrooms, PA Media reported. Keegan, who rejected the suggestion that the government did not have a grip on the problem, was asked about examples of headteachers driving to children’s homes to pick them up and bring them to school. “They have a duty,” she said. “We all have to play our part. “I have a number of headteachers who work with me on policy and sometimes you just have to do that – sometimes you have to go or you have to text the parent in the morning … you do whatever is possible.” Pressed on whether that was a good use of headteachers’ time, Keegan said: It is a good use to have all kids in school. That’s not what we want headteachers doing all of their days. But to be honest, right now, if that works to get somebody in school, it’s worth it. Education secretary Gillian Keegan also said this morning that the government would honour the 6.5% pay rise offered to teachers into the long term. She told Times Radio that the process of ensuring the pay cost could be covered and paid for without affecting frontline budgets had been “tricky” and “hard”. She also rejected suggestions that the prime minister had caved in to union demands, adding: No, I think Rishi has shown great leadership. It isn’t easy to do, and what you have to do is try and set expectations, to make sure people have reasonable expectations. Good morning and welcome to the UK politics live blog. We start the day with comments made by the education secretary urging the British Medical Association (BMA) to accept the recommended pay offer to public sector workers. The chair of the BMA’s UK council said Rishi Sunak’s pay increase offer “fails to address” years of below-inflation pay deals. Prof Phil Banfield added that the government’s offer “is exactly why so many doctors are feeling they have no option but to take industrial action”. But this morning Gillian Keegan said the organisation is being “unreasonable” and called on junior doctors to “look at” the 6% pay offer. She told LBC radio: Their starting position is an unreasonable position. We all understand there’s been inflation and there’s been a huge spike in inflation. And that’s impacting all of us. That’s why the main goal is to halve inflation. You can’t chase it. I would urge them to take the same approach as everybody else actually. Keegan also told Sky News: I would urge the BMA, the independent pay review bodies have done a very thorough analysis and they look at rates of recruitment, retention, they look at all the other sort of professions or similar professions so they do a very thorough job.\n",
      "politics\/live\/2023\/jul\/13\/doctors-strike-nhs-rishi-sunak-pay-uk-politics-live The chair of the British Medical Association’s UK council said Rishi Sunak’s pay increase offer “fails to address” years of below-inflation pay deals. Prof Phil Banfield said the government’s offer “is exactly why so many doctors are feeling they have no option but to take industrial action”. Earlier, Sunak issued a warning to trade unions and workers still involved in strikes and industrial action, telling a Downing Street press conference the new pay offer is “final”. All four teaching unions recommended accepting a pay offer. In a joint statement with Sunak, they said: “A 6.5% increase for teachers and school leaders recognises the vital role that teachers play in our country and ensures that teaching will continue to be an attractive profession.” Boris Johnson’s WhatsApp messages are yet to be received by the Covid inquiry because he is said to have forgotten the passcode for his old phone. The former prime minister’s spokesperson said Johnson still wanted to cooperate with the inquiry and did not deny being unable to recall the code. The Department for Education is to raid its existing budgets for £1.4bn to help fund the 6.5% pay rise offered to teachers in England, as part of the deal announced between the government and the teaching and school leader unions. The government will help fund public sector pay increases by “significantly” raising fees for migrants’ applications for visas and their access to the NHS, Rishi Sunak said. Junior doctors began a five-day strike in England today, described as the longest walkout of its kind in the NHS’s history. Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said there is “no fat on the bone” to fund staff pay rises out of existing hospital budgets. He told Channel 4 News: “It doesn’t look to us at first glance as though what has been identified by the prime minister and the chancellor as the money that will be available to pay for the gap between this offer and what is in the budget will be adequate.” Millions of public sector workers ranging from teachers to prison offers are in line for pay rises of between 5% and 7% as part of a government offer that could head off some strikes. Prior to the announcement, ministers had stressed the need for “discipline” at a time of rising inflation. Rishi Sunak warned that pay increases could not “fuel the fire” of inflation, which is at 8.7%. While some of the offers are generous enough to be accepted by union leaders, the government will be hoping that the impact on future inflation will be limited as additional borrowing has been avoided and no more money is being pumped into the economy. Teachers A 6.5% pay rise is being offered to teachers in England in what appears to be a package that also avoids problems as to how increases would be funded. The general secretaries of four education unions have said they will recommend that their members accept the offer and call off industrial action. While unions have been insisting that pay increases come with extra resources from the government rather than being met from school budgets, the government is funding almost half of the pay rise by “reprioritising” within its budgets. A former Tory MP who “saw the light” and switched to Labour in a high-profile defection has bid farewell to Westminster after nearly four decades. Making his valedictory retirement speech in parliament, Quentin Davies paid tribute to the NHS staff who saved his life after a near-fatal car crash. The former defence minister also praised the government’s support for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression. Davies was first elected to parliament in 1987, representing Stamford and Spalding and then the new seat of Grantham and Stamford until 2010, when he became a Labour peer in the House of Lords. The education secretary insists there will be no cuts to frontline education services despite teachers being offered a 6.5% pay rise by the government. Gillian Keegan said a reprioritising of the Department for Education’s budget would be enough to cover the cost of the wage increase, announced by the Government on Thursday. The new deal, approved by the Government after a recommendation from the School Teachers’ Review Body, is supported by the four teacher unions, the ASCL, NAHT, NASUWT and NEU. It is hoped that it will be enough to end the dispute over pay, with the unions balloting members with a recommendation to accept the pay offer. The news comes a day after members of the NASUWT voted in favour of industrial action, which, if the new deal is rejected, would see teachers stage continuous action short of strike action starting in September. Dr Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT, said the ballot has “unlocked months of prevarication” and members “can now expect more money in their pockets” as a result of previous action. If there is one constant in the UK’s policy towards China over the past three decades it has been its short-termism and inconsistency, the scathing intelligence and security committee report on China rightly finds, comparing Britain’s endless course corrections with Beijing’s capacity to think strategically about how to advance the global interests of the Chinese Communist party. If Downing Street thinks in terms of the next news bulletin, China has a planning cycle that in some of its documents takes it to 2049, as the ISC was told by one of its intelligence agency witnesses. Moreover, China brings a whole-of-government response, while in the UK too much strategy is conceived in the Cabinet Office, as its implementation rests with individual Whitehall policy departments, many with no security remit or expertise. Funding pay deals will be a “very big challenge” for many already squeezed public sector bodies, the chair of the Commons public accounts committee has said. Dame Meg Hillier told BBC Radio 4’s PM programme: “It’s difficult to know where it’s going to come from in already overstretched situations. And my committee of course looks a lot at hospitals, schools and other bits of the public sector and we know that they’re already very squeezed. “So it’s going to be some very painful choices for frontline leaders about how they’re actually going to fund this.” Hillier added it is “a bit robbing Peter to pay Paul”. The government has a “political imperative to try and deal with the strikes, but then they’re storing up other challenges” for the future, she said. The Unite union general secretary, Sharon Graham, has said she believes the public sector pay offers from the government will trigger more strikes. She told the BBC the government “are paying for some of it and then they’re saying for the rest, which is about £2bn, that that’s going to come out of cut services and cut areas in departments. So all that’s going to do is to stress workers out, make them have to work harder, more people will leave. “I think we’ll be seeing a new wave of industrial action.” The health and social care secretary, Steve Barclay, said the government’s acceptance of recommendations from pay review bodies and subsequent pay offer to health workers was “an opportunity for the NHS to move forward”. Junior doctors, who began their longest walkout yet in England on Thursday, will receive 6% rises and an additional consolidated £1,250 increase, while senior doctors, who are due to strike in England next week, will also receive a 6% rise. Barclay said: “Today’s offer, 10.3% for some doctors in training, some consultants getting pay rise of over £7,000, is a fair offer, a fair settlement. “It reflects the hugely important work that doctors do, and it’s an opportunity now for the NHS to move forward.” Barclay denied the government would be making department cutbacks to fund the increases and said the proposed immigration surcharge increase “better reflects the increased costs of providing NHS cover to those who come to the UK” and was a “fair and reasonable approach”. The home secretary, Suella Braverman, has welcomed a decision to allow ministers to take a legal battle over its contentious Rwanda deportation policy to the supreme court. She said: “I welcome this decision to grant permission to appeal. We need innovative solutions, like our migration partnership, to stop the boats, break the business model of the people-smuggling gangs and prevent further loss of life in the Channel.” It comes after an order published by the court of appeal said it found there were “substantial grounds for believing that the removal of asylum seekers to Rwanda exposed them to a real risk of ill-treatment” by being transferred to countries where they were at risk and violated the European convention on human rights. It confirmed that any removals under the deal remain unlawful unless the ruling is overturned, but added: “Permission is granted to the [home secretary] to appeal to the supreme court.” The Prison Officers Association (POA) said it will “not back down” in the wake of pay rises offered by the government. The national chair of the union, Mark Fairhurst, said: “Those members who received between 7% and 10% will not be fooled by yet another below-inflation award that will fail to convince them to stay in the service and will not improve their standard of living. “Years of pay freezes and austerity now need to be addressed in future pay awards. “We will now consider our options in relation to the failure to award a non-consolidated cost of living payment in line with other civil servants.” The government’s independent review of teachers’ pay paints a bleak picture for recruitment and retention, despite the government accepting its call for a 6.5% pay rise. The report of the School Teachers Review Body (STRB) said data on pay across the graduate labour market “show that some professions are offering significantly higher starting salaries than teaching”, with “systemic” shortages in almost all subjects. The report lays out the case for the 6.5% pay rise, and states: “The STRB is deeply concerned about the overall level of recruitment, the general trend emerging and what appears to be a firmly established and persistent problem of under-recruitment in certain subjects. “Persistent recruitment problems can result in a vicious circle where a shortage of teachers in a subject results in a deterioration in teaching quality. “The shortages we see in some subjects do not appear to be simply temporary but are systemic and require focused remediation with a long-term plan.” The STRB cited excessive workload as one of the primary reasons teachers leave the profession. England’s teaching and school leadership unions are balloting their members with a recommendation to accept the government’s pay offer – but say they will continue with strike ballots if the offer is rejected. The National Education Union, the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) and the National Association of Head Teachers are currently balloting members over strike action, with voting until the end of the month. Geoff Barton, the ASCL’s general secretary, said: “Our executive committee has unanimously agreed to recommend the government offer to members. We will be asking them directly whether or not they accept the offer, and if their answer is ‘yes’ we will then halt our industrial action ballot and proceed no further.” Downing Street reiterated that there would be “no more talks on pay”, after the BMA hit out at the pay offer for junior doctors announced on Thursday, PA reported. The prime minister’s official spokesperson said: I don’t think the prime minister could have been clearer today. There will be no more talks on pay. On the BMA’s own figures for a pay increase, he said: That is simply not fair to taxpayers. From the deal, independently set by the PRBs (pay review bodies), junior doctors will see around a 9% uplift to pay. Anyone … would think that is a significant increase. Certainly we do and we will not countenance borrowing more money or increasing taxation to go beyond what the independent pay review bodies have recommended. A leading expert on migration policy has said the government’s proposed changes will force many people trying to establish a new life in the UK into “substantial debt”. Dr Madeleine Sumption, the director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said: Costs will fall unevenly on different groups of migrants. For some skilled workers, employers will absorb the cost – the UK is already one of the most expensive countries in the world and employers will not like it, but depending on the amount, they may well pay it anyway. The implications are more serious for the majority of migrants who pay the fees themselves. For example, a person joining their British partner in the UK already pays more than £8,000 in government fees in the five years they spend in temporary status. There is already evidence that some migrants acquire substantial debt in order to pay fees, so a ‘significant’ fee rise could greatly increase the financial burden on new migrants in the UK as they try to establish themselves here. Boris Johnson’s WhatsApp messages are yet to be received by the Covid inquiry because he is said to have forgotten the passcode for his old phone. The former prime minister’s spokesperson said Johnson still wanted to cooperate with the inquiry and did not deny being unable to recall the code. Johnson stopped using the device in May 2021, after receiving security advice once it had emerged his phone number had been accessible online for at least 15 years. Bereaved families and technical experts have rubbished Johnson’s excuse for not being able to send the messages to the inquiry, with experts noting the former prime minister would still be able to access his messages as long as his WhatsApp is backed up. Johnson used the Apple iPhone in question during the coronavirus pandemic. It is likely to contain messages relating to the announcement of lockdowns in 2020. The government handed over the rest of Johnson’s unredacted notebooks, WhatsApp messages and diaries from his time in Downing Street to the inquiry after efforts to prevent their release failed. Steve Hartshorn, National Chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said of the 7% rise: That is a step in the right direction, but we must not lose sight of the fact that this uplift still fails to take account of the real term cut of 17% officers have suffered since 2000. It is important that government also provides new money for the pay award so that chief officers do not have to cut essential services to the public to fund it. Hearing today’s news, I have no doubt that police officers will have mixed feelings – on the one hand, they will be pleased that the pay award was not as bad as some media outlets had speculated, but also disappointed that it doesn’t fully take account of inflation, as they and their families struggle with increased utility, mortgage and food costs. We will continue to push for fair pay awards that take full account of inflation and recognise and reward the unique status of police officers; including the introduction of a fair, independent mechanism and negotiation process, so that we can properly sit down with government and employers to negotiate pay settlements that fully consider the risks and restrictions placed on police officers’ private and professional lives. The focus going forward needs to be on pay restoration. The British Medical Association’s chair of council says Rishi Sunak’s pay increase offer “fails to address” years of below-inflation pay deals. Prof Phil Banfield said the government’s offer “is exactly why so many doctors are feeling they have no option but to take industrial action”. He said: Today’s announcement represents yet another pay cut in real terms and serves only to increase the losses faced by doctors after more than a decade’s worth of sub-inflation pay awards. It completely ignores the BMA’s calls to value doctors for their expertise by full pay restoration to 2008\/2009 levels. With an NHS in crisis, seven and a half million patients on waiting lists, chronic underfunding and doctors being directly targeted with offers of work in Australia, this government should not be supporting pay uplifts which don’t reverse years of sub inflation pay awards. He added: The political choices this government is making continue to make ordinary people sicker and poorer; that is an unconscionable position for a ‘civilised’ society to be in. The government has been accused of treating people born outside the UK as “cash cows” after Rishi Sunak said public sector pay increases would be funded by raising fees for migrants’ visa applications and NHS access. Praxis, which supports migrants and refugees, said raising “already eye-wateringly high” visa fees risked seeing people fall “deeper into poverty and insecurity”. Josephine Whitaker-Yilmaz, the organisation’s policy and public affairs manager, said migrants in the UK paid some of the highest costs in Europe, PA reported. She said: The people we see at Praxis already pay thousands of pounds each time they need to renew their visa, and are struggling to afford these fees, especially as the cost of living crisis drags on. More than half of the people we spoke to in research carried out last year were struggling to afford bills and food as a result of these visa fees. Hiking fees still further risks pushing thousands deeper into poverty and insecurity. And these are people who, in many cases, have already been living in our communities, working and paying taxes for many years. Instead of treating people who were born outside the UK as cash cows to be tapped when the need arises, the government should be doing everything it can to get control of the cost of living crisis and ensure that every household has the support they need. China’s state institutions are aggressively targeting the UK, putting the country on course for a nightmare scenario that represents not just a commercial challenge but an existential threat to liberal democratic systems, parliament’s influential all-party intelligence and security committee has found. The inquiry – launched in 2019 and subject to various delays was completed in May – is scathing about the failure of the UK to wake up to the scale of the systemic challenge posed by the Chinese government’s “whole of state” assault on the British economy, politics, civil infrastructure and academia. Saying that until recently the UK government was willing to accept Chinese money with few questions asked, it claimed “as a consequence the UK is now playing catch-up and the whole of government has its work cut out to understand and counter the threat from China”. The failure to respond to the economic threat posed by China, and to put in place a way of protecting UK assets “is a serious failure and one that the UK may feel the consequences of for years to come”, the parliamentarians found. The committee said: “There is no evidence that Whitehall policy departments have the necessary resources, expertise or knowledge of the threat to counter China’s approach.” The government’s focus, the report said, was still dominated by short-term or acute threats. “It has consistently failed to think long term unlike China, which historically has been able to take advantage of this.” In a scathing assessment of British academia’s willingness to accept Chinese research grants, the report said, that “while some have expressed concern others seem willing to turn a blind eye, happy simply to take the money”. Catastrophic winter pressure on the NHS prompted junior doctors to ballot for strike action, the co-chair of the British Medical Association junior doctors committee said as members began a five-day walkout. Rob Laurenson told Radio 4’s Today programme the doctors had chosen to ballot after last winter “because year on year we’ve been saying that winters are catastrophic and that there are dangers”. Junior doctors began a five-day strike in England on Thursday, in what is being called the longest walkout of its kind in NHS history. It comes amid continuing protests over pay in the health service. Laurenson added: “And now, what we’ve realised is that people are compartmentalising this sense of crisis in the NHS to winters alone. It is true that there will at least be one hospital in the country that is severely understaffed any single day of the year, and its the government’s responsibility to be able to facilitate the environment for healthcare to be delivered at high standards to the people of this country.” The government has been challenged in the Commons over plans to close railway ticket offices, including by the speaker, who told the rail minister that he was being misinformed by train operators. Labour described the consultation over the proposals to close most ticket offices in England as a “sham” and Conservative MPs also raised concerns, as unions staged demonstrations around the country. The rail minister, Huw Merriman, sought to reassure MPs over what he said were industry-led proposals to cut costs, with revenue falling after the pandemic. Merriman said he believed that staff were better deployed on station concourses rather than “behind a glass screen”, adding: “I give the commitment again from the train operators that no currently staffed station will become unstaffed as a result of these changes.” The comment prompted an unusual intervention from the Commons speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who highlighted issues in his Chorley constituency. Sir Lindsay Hoyle told Merriman that at Chorley “the proposal is only to have someone available nine until four, which is half the time the ticket office was [open] … What you are being told isn’t the case.” The Department for Education is to raid its existing budgets for £1.4bn to help fund the 6.5% pay rise offered to teachers in England, as part of the deal announced between the government and the teaching and school leader unions. How pay rises would be funded was a major sticking point, with the unions insisting that pay increases come with extra resources from the government rather than being met from school budgets, as has happened in the past. Today’s joint announcement from No 10, the DfE and the unions stated: “Importantly, the government’s offer is properly funded for schools. The government has committed that all schools will receive additional funding above what was proposed in March, building on the additional £2bn given to schools in the autumn statement.” The government had argued that its previous offer – amounting to an average rise of 4.3% – could be afforded out of the £2bn increase last year, a position supported by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. But the “additional funding” being promised to pay for the higher increase announced today will come from the DfE, with an extra £500m in the 2023-24 financial year and £900m in 2024-25. The DfE said it will “reprioritise” its existing budgets “while protecting core budgets”. The DfE said it would also provide a hardship fund of up to £40m “to support those schools facing the greatest financial challenges”. The president of the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association Dr Naru Narayanan has said it is unlikely the prime minister’s announcement will bring an end to industrial action: Instead of serious negotiation on doctors’ pay we’ve had a grandstanding PR stunt which remains scant on detail. The government has known the pay review body recommendations since May, but is still sitting on its detailed findings. This underlines why we are calling for root-and-branch reform of the system. What we do know is that this is in an imposed outcome with funding apparently coming from NHS cost-cutting. Slicing into health budgets is no way to resolve industrial action centred on staffing and retention, and overall a concern for patient care. Imposing it in this like-it-or-lump-it way is also a total misreading of the mood on the ground. The petulant refusal to negotiate we’ve heard from the prime minister today won’t help at all and betrays a level of immaturity at the heart of government. There is a way to resolve industrial action by doctors, but that’s going to require serious discussion and acknowledgement of the central issue, which is over a decade of real-terms pay cuts. Without this it’s highly doubtful we’ll see an end to strikes. Mike Clancy, the general secretary of the Prospect union, which represents staff at organisations such as the Met Office, Health and Safety Executive and Natural England, has said: For a prime minister and chancellor who came into office promising economic stability, the chaotic handling of this process will inspire little confidence in workers worried about their futures during the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation. The fact that they are taking a knife to public services to pay for these pay rises signals that they have learned nothing from the austerity years. More than a decade of underfunding left us unprepared for the pandemic with public services across the board at breaking point. In particular, freezing civil service recruitment in the Ministry of Defence is a disastrous error that risks putting our nation’s security at risk. The department already has thousands of vacancies, and many of these civil servants work directly supporting the effort to win the war in Ukraine. It’s time the government recognised the value of its public services and allocated the money required to maintain them properly. Michael Gove, the secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities, is giving testimony to the Covid inquiry. During the pandemic, Gove served as chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster and Cabinet Office minister. You can follow his testimony here: It is perhaps notable that Sunak tries to head off criticism that it has taken a great deal of time – and not a small amount of strife, including the cancelled appointments and lengthening NHS waiting lists he explicitly cites – for his government to come up with this offer. The prime minister says he has agreed to honour the independent bodies’ recommendations. But that came after nearly three weeks of ministers talking up the idea that he might not. Moreover, public sector pay negotiations in general have been dragging on for many months, with several rounds of strikes causing significant disruption. Critics will ask why, if the prime minister think this is such a reasonable offer, it could not have been made earlier. It is also worth noting that the offer still constitutes real-terms pay cuts for millions of workers, coming on top of what unions say have been many years of the same. They are also nowhere near, in percentage-point terms, the 12.4% nominal increases junior doctors have been offered in Scotland. And that is not to mention the 26% the BMA has said would be needed to return the realterms pay of junior doctors’ in England to pre-Tory government levels. Downing Street has released a full transcript of Rishi Sunak’s speech announcing the new pay offer. When making decisions on pay, as your prime minister, I have a responsibility to be fair. Fair to public sector workers who do so much in the service of our country, but also fair to taxpayers who ultimately fund our public services. And the best way we’ve found of making fair decisions about public sector pay are the independent pay review bodies. They were called for by the unions themselves. And, for over four decades, they have been the independent arbiters of what is fair and responsible. Those bodies have considered a range of evidence about where to set this year’s pay. And their recommendations to government are for public sector pay rises to go up by a significant amount. Now, clearly, this will cost all of you as taxpayers more than we had budgeted for. That’s why the decision has been difficult and why it has taken time to decide the right course of action. I can confirm that, today, we’re accepting the headline recommendations of the pay review bodies in full. But we will not fund them by borrowing more or increasing your taxes. It would not be right to increase taxes on everyone to pay some people more; particularly when household budgets are so tight. Neither would it be right to pay for them by higher borrowing, because higher borrowing simply makes inflation worse. Instead, because we only have a fixed pot of money to spend from that means government departments have had to find savings and efficiencies elsewhere in order to prioritise paying public sector workers more. Now there is a clear message here. There are always choices, budgets are not infinite. When some ask for higher pay, that will always create pressures elsewhere costs which must ultimately be borne by the taxpayer – or spending less on our other priorities. So that’s our decision. And having honoured the independent pay review process, I urge all union leaders to accept these pay offers and call off their strikes. Already, earlier this year, the NHS staff council representing over half a dozen unions, and over a million NHS workers made a significant decision and voted to accept our pay offer and suspend strikes. I’m grateful to them and their members. And, today, in response to the news of our decision, I’m pleased to say that we’ve had another major breakthrough. All teaching unions have just announced that they’re suspending all planned strikes immediately. Teachers will return to the classroom. Disruption to our children’s education will end. And the unions have themselves confirmed that this pay offer is properly funded. And so, they’re recommending to their members an end to the entire dispute. So it is now clear: Momentum across our public services is shifting. The vast majority, who just want to get on with their life’s calling of serving others, are now returning to work. And, in that spirit, I want to address those yet to do so. Now that we’ve honoured the independent pay recommendations, I implore you: Do the right thing, and know when to say yes. In particular, for doctors and consultants, I would say this: We have a national mission for all of us to make the NHS strong again. The government has not only made today’s decision on pay, we’ve backed the NHS with record funding, delivered the first ever fully funded longterm workforce plan and met the BMA’s number one ask of government, with a pensions tax cut worth £1bn. So, we should all ask ourselves, whether union leaders – or, indeed, political leaders – how can it be right to continue disruptive industrial action? Not least because these strikes lead to tens of thousands of appointments being cancelled every single day, and waiting lists going up, not down. So, today’s offer is final. There will be no more talks on pay. We will not negotiate again on this year’s settlements. And no amount of strikes will change our decision. Instead, the settlement we’ve reached today gives us a fair way to end the strikes. A fair deal for workers. And a fair deal for the British taxpayer. Thank you. Rishi Sunak said “it’s not about cuts” but about departments reprioritising resources. The prime minister said: We are reprioritising. So we are asking departments to reprioritise to support public sector workers and that will mean in other areas – it’s not about cuts, it’s just about focusing on public sector workers’ pay rather than other things. And I’m really pleased that the teaching unions specifically have said that this pay offer is properly funded. He said “no cuts will need to be made” in schools. The government will help fund public sector pay increases by “significantly” raising fees for migrants’ visa applications and NHS access, Rishi Sunak said. The prime minister told a Downing Street press conference: “What we have done are two things to find this money. “The first is we’re going to increase the charges that we have for migrants who are coming to this country when they apply for visas. “And indeed, something called the immigration health surcharge, which is the levy that they pay to access the NHS. “So all of those fees are going to go up and that will raise over a billion pounds.” Rishi Sunak offered a warning to trade unions and workers still involved in strikes and industrial action. He told a Downing Street press conference that the new pay offer is “final”. “Now there’s a clear message here. There are always choices. Budgets are not infinite. When some ask for higher pay, that will always create pressures elsewhere,” he said. “It is now clear momentum across our public services is shifting. The vast majority who just want to get on with their life’s calling of serving others are now returning to work. “Today’s offer is final. There will be no more talks on pay. We will not negotiate again on this year’s settlements and no amount of strikes will change our decision.” He said the accepted recommendations were a “fair deal for the British taxpayer”. Rishi Sunak has confirmed the public sector pay rises will not be funded by more government borrowing. He told a press conference in Downing Street: Those [pay review] bodies have considered a range of evidence about where to set this year’s pay. And their recommendations to government are for public sector pay rises to go up by a significant amount. Now clearly, this will cost all of you as taxpayers more than we had budgeted for. That’s why the decision has been difficult, and why it has taken time to decide the right course of action. I can confirm today that we are accepting the headline recommendations of the pay review bodies in full, but we will not fund them by borrowing more or increasing your taxes. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and the education secretary, Gillian Keegan, have issued a joint statement on pay alongside the general secretaries of the four education unions – Mary Bousted, Kevin Courtney, Geoff Barton, Paul Whiteman and Patrick Roach – as well as the general secretary-elect of the NEU, Daniel Kebede. “This is the largest ever recommendation from the school teachers’ review body (STRB),” it said. “A 6.5% increase for teachers and school leaders recognises the vital role that teachers play in our country and ensures that teaching will continue to be an attractive profession. The government has accepted the STRB’s recommendation and has agreed to bring forward wider reforms to reduce teacher and leader workload in partnership with all four unions. “Importantly, the government’s offer is properly funded for schools. The government has committed that all schools will receive additional funding above what was proposed in March, building on the additional £2bn given to schools in the autumn statement. “The government will also provide a hardship fund of up to £40m to support those schools facing the greatest financial challenges. “ASCL, NAHT, NASUWT and NEU will now put this deal to members, with a recommendation to accept the STRB recommendation. This deal will allow teachers and school leaders to call off strike action and resume normal relations with government.” The prime minister is holding a press conference following the news that he has agreed to give millions of public sector workers a pay rise of at least 6%. You can follow the stream below. We will bring you the latest from it shortly. Millions of public sector workers will be given a pay rise of at least 6%, but government departments have been told to fund the rise from within existing budgets. Police officers, junior doctors and teachers in England are among those who would benefit after the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, accepted all the recommendations of the independent pay review bodies. Senior government figures are understood to have been concerned about the effects of the pay boost on stubbornly high inflation. Earlier this week, the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, ruled out providing any extra money funded through borrowing. The move will leave departments facing difficult decisions about how to reallocate spending, with potential knock-on effects for frontline services cuts. The Treasury had budgeted for pay rises of about 3.5%, meaning between £3bn and £5bn will need to be found across Whitehall to make up the shortfall. Rishi Sunak’s report back from the Nato summit in the Commons earlier passed by with barely a mention of the defence secretary’s comments that Ukraine should show “a bit of gratitude” for the military aid it has received from the west. The PM appeared keen to draw a line under the row and when Ben Wallace was praised by the Conservative backbencher Mark Francois for his support to Ukraine, he was not name-checked by Sunak in his reply. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, did, however, ask the prime minister “to correct the record” after an overnight tweet from Sunak which said: “Labour didn’t want me to attend Nato this week.” The opposition leader told MPs that “on the contrary, we were delighted that he was there, because in an ever more dangerous world, we must be united” and emphasised his party’s commitment to Nato dating back to its foundation under the postwar Attlee government. Last week the veteran Labour backbencher Chris Bryant had criticised Sunak for his lack of attendance at prime minister’s questions, to which Sunak had responded by saying the clash with the Nato summit was unavoidable. “It’s a bit rich for you to attack me for missing prime minister’s question time,” Sunak said during tense exchanges in which the speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, increasingly interrupted to control the noise in the chamber. The Times’s political editor, Steven Swinford, is reporting that Rishi Sunak has accepted the recommendations of “all public sector pay review bodies”. It means that millions of public sector workers, including teachers, doctors and police officers, could get pay rises of 6% or more – but it will be funded from existing budgets. He outlines the projected increases in the tweet below. Labour said the Office for Budget Responsibility’s fiscal risks report demonstrated the government would “never match the ambition” of the UK public. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said: This report shows just how far we are falling behind our peers, how exposed our economy is, and again highlights that the government is failing to take action in areas like energy security to help get bills down. It tells you all you need to know that the cost of government borrowing has risen faster in the UK than elsewhere in the G7 and faster than at any time in the last 40 years. There are serious decisions to be made by this Tory government to restore some security in our economy, to get a grip on inflation, and to stop people’s bills rising. Instead, this new evidence and falling growth figures today show they will never match the ambition of the British people. It’s time for them to step aside and let Labour restore our national economic and financial security, driven by our mission to secure the highest sustained growth in the G7. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said the government would take “difficult but responsible” decisions on public sector pay, ahead of the announcement of settlements for millions of workers. He told MPs that “it is important to deliver on the prime minister’s priority to get debt falling and to control borrowing to avoid adding inflationary pressures and risk prolonging higher inflation”, PA reported. “That means taking difficult but responsible decisions on the public finances, including public sector pay, because more borrowing is itself inflationary,” Hunt said. His comments came in a written statement responding to the Office for Budget Responsibility’s fiscal risks and sustainability report. The budget watchdog’s report warned that the public finances are in a “very risky” period after a series of shocks left them in a “vulnerable position” on tackling challenges such as an ageing population. The Home Office will offer “no more concessions”, a government source has told the Guardian, after peers made numerous changes to plans designed to tackle the small boats issue. The House of Lords voted to reinstate provisions to the illegal migration bill that were removed by MPs earlier in the week. In a series of votes that went on until the early hours of Thursday, peers inflicted nine defeats on the government – triggering “ping pong”, meaning the draft legislation will go back to the Commons next week. Ministers hope the bill will be passed before the summer recess, which starts next Friday. BBC chief Tim Davie will be questioned in parliament about the corporation’s leadership following the Huw Edwards scandal. The BBC director general, acting chairwoman Dame Elan Closs Stephens and policy director Clare Sumner have been called to appear before the Lords Communications Committee on Tuesday. The peers will raise a range of issues, including “in light of recent events, what concerns have been raised about the adequacy of the BBC’s governance arrangements and how it is addressing these”. Labour would make it “impossible” for the prime minister not to take action where appropriate in cases of suspected misconduct by bringing the ministerial standards process further into the public domain, Angela Rayner said. The party’s deputy leader said it is currently “at the prime minister’s whim whether they open an investigation” into accusations, PA Media reported. Labour would create an independent ethics and integrity commission with stronger powers than the current system and force it to report to parliament annually, Rayner said. “The prime minister would find it impossible then to not carry out those functions and do what is required, because that transparency is there,” she said. Junior doctors and members of the British Medical Association (BMA) on the picket line outside Leeds General Infirmary at the start a five-day strike amid the continuing dispute over pay, the longest walkout of its kind in the history of the NHS. Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner claimed Boris Johnson is not “just one bad apple” as she made the case for an overhaul of the public standards system. Speaking to the Institute for Government, she said: Take Boris Johnson as just a random example – a very effective confidence trickster. He certainly sounded like the typical good chap but I don’t think there are many serious people who would call him that now. From unlawfully proroguing parliament to breeding a culture of rule-breaking at the heart of Downing Street during a global pandemic, then lying about it. She said “this isn’t all about him” and that Conservative MPs, including the current prime minster Rishi Sunak, “enabled him and propped him up”. Rayner added: I’m afraid Boris Johnson wasn’t just one bad apple. Over the last decade, standards in public life have been relentlessly eroded by Tory sleaze and scandal, from serious breaches of the ministerial code to the revolving door between ministerial office and lobbying. The number of people in England waiting to start routine hospital treatment has hit a new record. An estimated 7.47 million people were waiting to start treatment at the end of May, up from 7.42 million in March, NHS England said. It is the highest number since records began in August 2007. Prime minister Rishi Sunak has made cutting waiting lists one of his priorities for 2023, pledging in January that “lists will fall and people will get the care they need more quickly”. A junior doctor on the picket line outside the University College Hospital in London said she is “worried” for the NHS’s future. Rebecca Lissmann, 29, told the PA news agency: I feel worried because people sometimes compare medicine to the aviation industry but if they’re short-staffed a flight gets cancelled, if we’re short-staffed an operation might be cancelled. I was on a long weekend on call the other week and I was essentially doing the job of two people. If something went wrong these patients are my responsibility. We want to deliver care that we’re proud of and what we would want our family to receive but that’s not possible at the moment. I look at my rota and there’s gaps where they need people to fill shifts; these shifts are getting advertised in WhatsApp groups. Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt are finalising decisions on pay for millions of public sector workers against a backdrop of a doctors’ strike, a weak economy and persistent high inflation. The prime minister and chancellor are meeting on Thursday to decide whether to accept the recommendations of pay bodies which are thought to be suggesting rises of around 6-6.5% for a variety of professions from medics to teachers, PA Media reported. A failure to accept the reports would provoke further rows with the unions, a problem underlined as junior doctors embarked on their longest walkout yet in England on Thursday. The Treasury has ruled out increasing borrowing to pay for wage rises, meaning any extra cash for workers may have to come from raiding existing departmental budges, potentially meaning cuts to services. The current level of CPI inflation is running at 8.7% and Sunak – who has promised to cut it to about 5.3% by the end of the year – wants to avoid pay increases which could fuel a wage-price spiral. The wider economic challenge facing the Chancellor and prime minister was illustrated by official figures showing the UK economy contracted in May. Written statements listed on Thursday’s order paper show ministers are due to give updates on the NHS, police, teachers, the armed forces, civil service and the justice system. Disruption to thousands of planned appointments is expected as junior doctors in England on Thursday started their longest walkout yet in protest over pay. The strike started at 7am and ends at the same time on Tuesday. A junior doctor on the picket lane outside University College Hospital in central London said many medics are considering moving abroad to work. Arjan Sing, 27, who works in the capital, told the PA news agency: Medicine is one of those careers you have to start planning for from about the age of 14 so people spend their lives planning their career. Those people are now thinking of leaving and they’re now making concrete plans to leave. There are all these countries that care about their doctors and our government is not respecting us. People have seen this coming and doctors have realised they work in a global market, they’re not restricted to this country. NHS Providers has urged both sides to resume talks in a bid to head off more industrial action. Deputy chief executive Saffron Cordery said: The impact of these disputes is fraying the fabric of the NHS, held together by a unique sense of commitment and shared endeavour across the workforce that has served it so well over so many years. We lose that at our peril. The disruption for many thousands of patients and the potential harm of delaying their treatment is a huge and growing risk for the NHS to manage. Trusts will hardly have time to draw breath after a five-day walkout by junior doctors before consultants strike for two days, followed by a two-day strike by radiographers. The domino effect of repeated waves of industrial action is eroding the fundamental relationship between trust leaders and their staff. Trust leaders understand the strength of feeling among striking staff, who they value and work with for patients every day, and why they are taking action. Trusts will continue to do everything they can to limit disruption and keep patients safe but that’s getting harder and more expensive with every strike as the cost of hiring cover grows, and with staff dissatisfaction increasing as disputes remain unresolved. Eight consecutive months of industrial action across the NHS are taking their toll not just on patients, with more than 651,000 routine procedures and appointments forced to be rescheduled, but on already overstretched services - hampering efforts to cut waiting lists. Rishi Sunak’s pledge to cut NHS waiting times will be impossible to meet if strikes are still disrupting care beyond the summer, health service chiefs have privately warned ministers. The prime minister promised in January that “NHS waiting lists will fall” when he outlined five pledges, reflecting “the people’s priorities”, by which voters should judge his performance, he said. However, NHS England has told ministers that hospitals will not be able to ensure that Sunak fulfils his pledge because of the disruption caused by junior doctors’ ongoing strikes. Services, including surgery and outpatient appointments, will be hit again from Thursday when tens of thousands of junior doctors in England take part in a five-day walkout – the longest stoppage in NHS history. It will be their fourth bout of industrial action since March. Good morning. Junior doctors are beginning a five-day strike in England today. It is being described as the longest walkout of its kind in the NHS’s history amid ongoing protests over pay in the health service. The strikes are being held amid speculation the government will say if it is going to accept recommendations from pay review bodies affecting public sector workers including teachers, civil servants and NHS workers. There is speculation that the bodies have recommended rises of between 6% and 6.5%. BMA leaders urged the Government to return to the negotiating table in a bid to resolve the long-running row, which has already led to a series of strikes and thousands of cancelled operations and consultations. BMA leaders Dr Robert Laurenson and Dr Vivek Trivedi said: Today marks the start of the longest single walkout by doctors in the NHS’s history, but this is still not a record that needs to go into the history books. We can call this strike off today if the UK Government will simply follow the example of the government in Scotland and drop their nonsensical precondition of not talking whilst strikes are announced and produce an offer which is credible to the doctors they are speaking with. The pay offer on the table to junior doctors in Scotland and how it was reached throws into sharp relief the obstinate approach being taken by the Prime Minister and the Health Secretary, Steve Barclay. The Health Secretary has said there can be no talks while strikes are planned - Scotland has proved him wrong. He said above 5% wasn’t realistic - Scotland proved him wrong. He refused to even acknowledge the concept of pay restoration - Scotland proved this is not only possible but essential. The BMA leaders said talks have to be resumed, adding: The government’s refusal to talk with junior doctors in England who have strikes planned is out of keeping with all norms of industrial action. Doctors have a right to expect that as in Scotland, and as in many other recent industrial disputes, talks will continue right up to the last minute to try and reach a deal without the need to strike. The complete inflexibility we see from the UK government today is baffling, frustrating and ultimately destructive for everyone who wants waiting lists to go down and NHS staffing numbers to go up. The government has missed chance after chance to provide a credible offer and potentially bring to an end the industrial action by junior doctors in England and whilst there are differences between junior doctors and governments in England and Scotland, the UK government has far more financial freedom to give doctors what they deserve. We’ll bring you the latest updates on this and other political stories throughout the day.\n",
      "politics\/2023\/jul\/13\/its-dr-sunak-and-mr-hyde-the-existence-of-two-rishs-would-explain-a-lot It was a brisk and businesslike Rishi Sunak who raced into the Downing Street media room at lunchtime. The desperation of someone keen to project an air of getting things done. Sooner or later. Usually later. At least, we had to assume it was the prime minister. Though it could have been a doppelganger. It’s a while since Sunak had appeared in person before a UK audience. Still, best to take these things on trust. Good news, said Rish!. Of course it was. He wouldn’t have shown his face if he didn’t think he had a positive story to tell. Then it would have been just slipped out in a written ministerial statement. The government had agreed to accept the recommendations of the independent pay review boards and give public sector workers a rise of between 6 and 7%. Still in effect a pay cut, given inflation, on top of real-terms cuts over the past 13 years. But he didn’t think to mention that. No need to spoil the Mr Nice Guy narrative. “We are accepting the recommendations in full,” Sunak said magnanimously. Er … let’s think this one through. The whole point of an independent pay review board is that it’s not independent. It’s totally rigged. Packed with government stooges who have been briefed to see if they can get away with offering workers the bare minimum. In which case, if even they think teachers and NHS staff are worth 6.5% then the chances are it’s at the bottom end of what they should be getting. Generous, it isn’t. Hold that thought. Because most of us – those of us who are still vaguely sentient at least – could have sworn we remembered Sunak telling us only a few weeks ago that a 6.5% pay rise was inflationary and unaffordable. Or maybe that was a different Sunak who was saying that. The one who prefers to stay hidden indoors. Come to think of it, the existence of two Sunaks – Dr Sunak and Mr Hyde – is maybe the best explanation of the current car wreck of a government. Suddenly things make sense. If not in a good way. Anyway, here we had one of the two Sunaks – let’s hope there doesn’t turn out to a third Sunak somewhere: that really would be confusing. Not so say terrifying – glibly announcing the very opposite of what he had said previously. And we were all meant to have a memory wipe. The past nine months had never happened. Here was the new reality. The independent pay review boards had made their recommendations and he had accepted them. Just like that. He hadn’t said they were unaffordable and put the country through months of unnecessary industrial action only to change his mind at the last minute. Because one of the Sunaks would never have dreamed of doing that. One of them was a man who had told us we could trust him to tell the truth. A man of his word. Except he was now turning out to be a man of many words. Most of them contradictory. The new honesty, integrity and professionalism. “It would be wrong to fund the pay rises by increasing taxes or borrowing,” continued Rish!. So instead he would be paying for them by increased departmental efficiencies and savings. Oh, goody. AKA the magic money tree, cuts to public services and redundancies. Most public sector services are already underfunded and understaffed. But hey, we’re British and we can take it. There is no greater glory than to be asked to die on an NHS waiting list. But look! Sunak had been far too generous as it was in giving people not enough money to live on. Now he wanted to get tough. He had gone the extra mile by offering the bare minimum. And he was pleased the teaching unions had come onside. They weren’t that bothered if there were cuts or not. Now he was asking everyone else who was on strike to do likewise. He wasn’t going to negotiate again. This was his final offer. Except he had said his previous offer of 3.5% was his final offer. Or was that Mr Hyde’s final offer? Either way, the NHS unions didn’t seem particularly impressed. Most of the questions from journalists homed in on how the government was going to pay for the wage rises. Easy, said one of the Sunaks. We were going to charge migrants more for visas and increase the immigration health surcharge. That would raise £1bn. More or less. Less, probably. Fine … so where was the other £2bn-£4bn going to come from? Oh that? Well, you know. Something would probably turn up. Stop talking the country down. This was meant to be a good news day. He didn’t say whether frontline services would be protected. Probably not then. Still, we were a bit nearer to which Sunak was in the room by the end. Asked if he could put a figure to his inflation target, he suddenly became all coy. When he had said he would halve inflation, he hadn’t meant it to be taken literally. Rather, it was just meant as mood music. People would know the target had been hit when they could be talked into feeling better about themselves. I’ve got news for him. People won’t feel better when inflation hits 5.35%. They will just be getting more broke slightly less slowly. This was the Sunak who couldn’t tell the truth. Earlier in the morning, one of the Sunaks had made a rare appearance in the Commons. The speaker even said how nice it was to see him after so long. Rish! didn’t look amused as he prepared to give his Nato statement. Not the most testing of hours as everyone is agreed on its importance and the need to offer ongoing support to Ukraine. Though this didn’t stop this Sunak from getting quite snitty. He needs the country to show its gratitude to him for all the tremendous work he has been doing on its behalf. “Labour didn’t want me to go to Vilnius,” he snarked. Keir Starmer looked bemused. He had never said that. It had been his excuse for missing prime minister’s questions the week before that everyone had taken exception to. Hmm, Sunak snorted. At least Ukraine appreciates me. Whichever Sunak it was, it was the thin-skinned one. Depraved New World by John Crace (Guardian Faber, £16.99) is available to pre-order.

      "politics\/2023\/jul\/12\/home-office-had-murals-for-children-removed-at-second-asylum-centre The Home Office ordered the removal of child-friendly murals from the controversial Manston detention camp near Ramsgate, as well as a separate reception centre, the Guardian has learned. The i newspaper revealed last week that the immigration minister, Robert Jenrick, had ordered the removal of colourful murals of Disney cartoon characters including Mickey Mouse and Baloo the bear painted on the walls at the Kent Intake Unit (KIU) at Dover. The KIU, 20 miles from the Manston camp, is where children, mainly those who are unaccompanied, are processed after arriving on small boats. Now it has emerged that the order to paint over murals also extended to Manston, where at its busiest time, towards the end of last year, about 4,000 people were held – including many children ranging from babies to teenagers. It is understood that the murals at both sites were painted over last Tuesday by the Ministry of Justice’s estates team. The child-friendly images at Manston were praised in an inspection report published last month by His Majesty’s Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP), on conditions at Manston, KIU and another initial reception centre on the Kent coast, Western Jet Foil. Referencing the decorations, the HMIP report states: “The family marquee was decorated in bright, cheerful colours.” That praise was set against multiple concerns raised in the report about the welfare of children. The report found that children were detained for “far too long” at all of the reception sites, with 232 children held for more than 96 hours, although the time limit is currently 24 hours. The longest a child was held was 19 days. In one case, a 17-year-old girl who had a 10-month-old baby she said was conceived through rape was held at KIU for almost 24 hours. It was initially reported that Jenrick had said the murals had to be removed because they were “too welcoming” but on Tuesday he told MPs they were not “age appropriate” for teenage migrants. However, the Home Office has admitted that unaccompanied children as young as nine have arrived in the UK on small boats, and there is a family section at Manston that includes facilities for parents with babies and toddlers. At prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, the SNP MP Peter Wishart called on the deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden, who was standing in for Rishi Sunak, to condemn the Home Office’s decision to paint over the KIU mural. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything quite so grotesque as the painting over of Mickey Mouse on a children’s mural, as was done by the Home Office in a detention centre in Kent,” Wishart said. “No minister so far has raised the necessary compassion or concern to speak out about this. So can I ask the deputy prime minister to look into the deeper recesses of his soul and just simply condemn it?” Dowden replied: “I’ll tell him what real compassion looks like and that means stopping the vile people-smuggling trade across the Channel condemning women and children to death.” The murals row has come at a time when refugee and children’s charities have raised profound concerns about what they describe as “non-concessions” in the illegal migration bill that will allow unaccompanied children to be in detention centres when they arrive with no time limit Andy Baxter, assistant general secretary of the Prison Officers Association trade union, said: “The instruction from the minister conflicts with both the immigration inspectorate and HMIP’s ambitions to make vulnerable children feel safe.” He added that his members believed the instruction conflicted with the policy of promoting the welfare of children in their care. A Home Office spokesperson said: “Manston is a short-term holding facility where we conduct comprehensive security and health checks as part of the arrivals process. All buildings are regularly reviewed and assessed for health and safety compliance. “Our priority is to stop the boats and disrupt the people smugglers. The government has gone further by introducing legislation which will ensure that those people arriving in the UK illegally are detained and promptly removed to their country of origin or a safe third country.”\n",
      "politics\/live\/2023\/jul\/12\/rishi-sunak-nato-conservatives-tory-mps-pmqs-oliver-dowden-angela-rayner-uk-politics-live Here’s a summary of today’s events: During PMQs, Angela Rayner pointed out the last time the deputies stood in at PMQs two weeks running was in 1996. She says she’s proud to be in the same place John Prescott once stood, before pointing at Oliver Dowden, standing in for Sunak: “He’s no Heseltine.” Inspired by John Prescott’s question back in 1996, she pointed out that “tens of 1000s of families are facing repossession and homelessness” due to the “Tory mortgage bombshell”. The UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, gave a standalone press conference in Vilnius. From a UK perspective Sunak said “we are the leading European contributor to Nato” and said that British people should know how appreciated that is within the alliance, as one of the only nations that contributes to every Nato mission. The prime minister has shut down comments by the defence secretary after Ben Wallace suggested Ukraine should show “gratitude” for the military support it has been given. Rishi Sunak said the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy had “repeatedly expressed gratitude” for what the UK had done for Kyiv since Russia’s invasion broke out more than 500 days ago. Nadine Dorries has been reported to the chief whip and Commons speaker after allegedly sending “forceful” emails to the government about not being given a peerage. In a highly unusual move, the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, revealed he had “flagged” the issue to the parliamentary authorities, and also asked for advice about any potential breach of the law. Michael Gove’s department is handing back £1.9bn to the Treasury originally meant to tackle England’s housing crisis after struggling to find projects to spend it on. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) has surrendered hundreds of millions of pounds budgeted for 2022-23, including £255m meant to fund new affordable housing and £245m meant to improve building safety. Jeremy Hunt has told ministers there will be no extra money to give millions of public sector workers an average 6% pay rise, potentially leaving departments facing a difficult choice between raising salaries or cutting frontline services. Rishi Sunak is set to host all Tory MPs for morale-boosting hog roast at Downing Street tonight. He’s due to fly back to the UK from the Nato summit this evening in time to welcome his guests and try to instil some positivity over his party’s struggle to recover in the polls and the prospect of them potentially losing in all three by-elections taking place next week on 20 July. The Civil service chief, Simon Case, said the last five years had seen a deterioration in relations between officials and politicians, although he added the situation had improved since Rishi Sunak became prime minister. That’s it for me for today. Thanks so much for joining me. Almost 1 million UK homeowners will be forced to shell out at least £500 more a month to cover mortgage payments by the end of 2026, as borrowers suffer the consequences of rising interest rates, the Bank of England has warned. Forecasts released on Wednesday showed that of the 4 million homeowners expected to roll on to new mortgage contracts over the next three years, the majority will be paying up to £220 more a month to cover the mortgage by the end of this year because of the difficulty of finding contracts with comparable rates. The payments of more than 1 million borrowers are likely to rise by more than twice that amount by the end of 2026. Markets are increasingly betting that policymakers at the Bank raise interest rates beyond the current level of 5% to a peak of 6.25% in early 2024 in order to combat stubbornly high inflation. The average two-year fixed mortgage rate rose to 6.7% on Wednesday – the highest level since the middle of the financial crisis in August 2008, according to data from Moneyfacts. However, the Bank governor, Andrew Bailey, said higher payments were part of the wider economic trade-off of trying to tame price growth. He said: It is going to have an impact, clearly. That is part of the transmission of monetary policy, no question about that. And I’m going to come back to the point we’ve made a number of times … we are trying to balance having the transmission function of monetary policy with two things … one is the resilience of the banking system, and two, its ability to support customers and manage the consequences of this. But there still will be consequences of increased interest rates.

Rishi Sunak said the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, had “repeatedly expressed gratitude” for what the UK had done for Kyiv since Russia’s invasion broke out more than 500 days ago. Wallace, in comments to reporters at the Nato summit in Vilnius, suggested Zelenskiy needed to be mindful about keeping “doubting politicians” in the US on-side, particularly with a presidential election coming up next year. The former Scots Guard said some allies providing defensive aid to Kyiv “want to see gratitude”. But Sunak, in a push back against his cabinet minister, said the Ukrainian people were “incredibly grateful for the support we have shown”. You can follow more on the Ukraine-Russia war here: Members of the NASUWT teachers’ union have voted in favour of industrial action over pay and workload, raising the prospect of mass strikes and widespread disruption across schools in England this autumn. After months of stalemate with no progress over teachers’ pay, NASUWT members voted decisively for industrial action, with 88.5% of eligible members voting to support strike action and 94.3% supporting action short of strike. The union will now draw up a programme of industrial action short of strike action starting in September, which will mean teachers working to rule. The NASUWT will also discuss the possibility of coordinated strike action with other education unions during the autumn term. Negotiations between the Department for Education and the unions ended in March, with the NASUWT, the National Education Union, the National Association of Head Teachers and the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) all decisively rejecting the government’s offer of a 4.3% pay rise and £1,000 one-off payment. Since then the government has refused to reopen talks, with the education secretary, Gillian Keegan, saying ministers would wait for the School Teachers’ Review Body (STRB) recommendations before making a further pay offer for the 2023-24 school year. Read the full story here: Boris Johnson’s vacated Uxbridge and South Ruislip seat is one of three up for grabs next week, but the contest for the west London constituency is leading to particularly frayed nerves among both the Conservatives and Labour. Of the three byelections for Tory-held seats on 20 July, Labour’s best chance of winning appears to be in the “metroland” constituency, which was sprinkled with Johnson’s political stardust for more than eight years, before his rapid fall from grace. Recent polling has put the party’s Danny Beales eight points ahead of his Tory rival. But a rearguard action by the Conservatives is seeking to frame the contest as a mini-referendum on opposition to the London mayor Sadiq Khan’s expansion of the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) to rest of the city. One Labour source said: I go through days where I think we are doomed, and then days where I think we are actually going to do this. But it’s going to be close and I don’t think it is going to be a huge victory for either party. Ultimately, the source believes the Tories are overplaying the Ulez card and that concern about it will be trumped by those about the cost of living crisis and interest rate rises, particularly among younger families who have changed the seat’s demographics. Home to significant numbers of retirees – and with pockets of deprivation and prosperity – ethnically diverse, leave-voting constituency would be a particular fillip for Keir Starmer’s project. Read the full story here: Nadine Dorries has been reported to the chief whip and Commons speaker after allegedly sending “forceful” emails to the government about not being given a peerage. In a highly unusual move, the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, revealed he had “flagged” the issue to the parliamentary authorities, and also asked for advice about any potential breach of the law. The revelation threatens to reignite questions over Boris Johnson’s honours list, which was published last month but did not include at least one other MP who had expected to be given a peerage – leading that MP, Nigel Adams, to resign in protest. Dorries tweeted on 9 June that she was standing down “with immediate effect”, but more than a month later has not formally done so. She said recently she was waiting for answers from ministers about why she was denied a peerage. The Tory MP William Wragg described her as the “lingering” MP for Mid Bedfordshire, during an evidence session of the public administration and constitutional affairs committee on Wednesday. Dorries, according to Wragg, used “rather forceful communications … threatening to use her position as an MP to get to the bottom of why she hasn’t been given a peerage”. Case said he was “aware of those communications” and had “flagged them” to the chief whip, Simon Hart, and the Commons speaker, Lindsay Hoyle.

The prime minister told a press conference in Lithuania: I am absolutely laser focused on delivering for the British people. Their priorities are my priorities. Halving inflation because that’s the best way that we can ease the burden on them and the cost of living, cutting waiting lists because it’s wrong that people have to wait as long as they are currently, and about stopping the boats because that’s about simple fairness, as well as everything else. And just most recently, you could see us delivering on that just yesterday in parliament, passing some of the toughest legislation that any government has ever passed when it comes to tackling that priority. He added: I am ambitious for the country and I’m ambitious for what I want to achieve for people. So it’s right that I set ambitious priorities and targets and it’s right that we strain every sinew to meet them and that’s what I’m doing. At the press conference, Rishi Sunak was asked whether he would consider temporarily raising taxes to curb inflation. Some backbench MPs have also called for the government to cut inflation, even as ministers have stressed the need for a responsible fiscal policy to cut inflation. He said: It’s important that government has a responsible approach to fiscal policy in order to complement what the Bank of England is doing on monetary policy, so that we can halve inflation on its way back down to its long-term target. Now, all the decisions that we make are going to be guided by that. Rishi Sunak was asked about public sector pay during his press conference. He said his decision will be guided by two principles. The first is fairness. Fairness for our public sector workers, because we want to make sure that they’re rewarded fairly for their hard work, but also fairness the taxpayers who have to foot the bill for pay rises, and the other thing will be guided by is responsibility. Everyone knows the economic context that we’re in and we need to make sure that government decisions, particularly when it comes to not borrowing more, are made responsibly so that we don’t fuel inflation and make it worse or last for longer. The UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, is giving a standalone press conference in Vilnius. From a UK perspective Sunak said “we are the leading European contributor to Nato” and said that British people should know how appreciated that is within the alliance, as one of the only nations that contributes to every Nato mission. He lauded the G7 framework for security for Ukraine but said the UK had moved first on several elements in providing for Ukraine, and said that the UK starts training Ukrainian pilots next month. He harks back to the UK being one of the founding members of Nato. He said: Nato is more important than ever. It has proved to be one the most important alliance in history and the UK is at its heart. He is taking questions from journalists who are asking about domestic policy as well as questions about Nato. You can follow our Ukraine liveblog for more on the latter: Almost 1,200 Scottish homes are being brought back into use to house Ukrainian refugees with the help of a Scottish government fund. PA reports: A total of 14 projects have been provided with £23m to bring 1,168 homes back into use, offering accommodation to those fleeing to Scotland due to the Russian invasion. The money came from a £50m fund that the Scottish government set up last year, with almost 1,000 Ukrainian nationals already being put up in 450 refurbished homes, according to government figures. The figures come as the contract for a cruise ship in Edinburgh which temporarily housed Ukrainian refugees ended. Shirley-Anne Somerville, the social justice secretary, said: “We stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine and are determined to do all we can to help those who wish to build their life here in Scotland. “Our innovative £50m programme provides a vital lifeline for those fleeing the war by providing long-term and secure accommodation through reclaimed empty homes. “I am proud that Scotland has been able to play its part and pleased to see us reach and surpass the crucial milestone of 1,000 homes for displaced Ukrainians. “We have been able to house hundreds of families and individuals in safe accommodation so far and we will continue to work closely with councils and housing associations as we build on this excellent progress.” According to the most recent figures, almost 25,000 Ukrainians came to the UK with a sponsor located in Scotland, 20,022 under the Scottish government’s super sponsor scheme. G7 countries have agreed to stand by Ukraine for “as long as it takes” as they set out the details of what a package of new security measures will entail, with the UK pledging to get more Ukrainian pilots trained in Britain. PA reports: The leaders of the wealthiest economies, which includes the UK, US, Japan, Canada, France, Germany and Italy, jointly penned a security accord at the Nato summit in Vilnius on Wednesday. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has said it marks a “new high point” in international support for Ukraine. He thinks it will send a message to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and has the potential to bring an end to the conflict in eastern Europe. The pact contains promises to act multilaterally and on a country-to-country basis to offer Ukraine long-term security guarantees. The UK’s side of the bargain will see more Ukrainian pilots trained in Britain. No 10 said the precise offer for each country will be set out in their bilateral agreements. In a joint declaration signed by G7 leaders, they said: “We will stand with Ukraine as it defends itself against Russian aggression, for as long as it takes. “We stand united in our enduring support for Ukraine, rooted in our shared democratic values and interests, above all, respect for the UN charter and the principles of territorial integrity and sovereignty.” The group said the mission was to “ensure a sustainable force capable of defending Ukraine now and deterring Russian aggression in the future”. The pact promises security assistance and modern military equipment, prioritising air defence, artillery and long-range fires, armoured vehicles and other key capabilities, such as air combat. Ukraine’s military equipment will increasingly be brought into “interoperability with Euro-Atlantic partners”. Plans are also in place to boost Kyiv’s defence industry, commit to more training exercises and provide support for cyber defence and resilience initiatives. G7 countries are also pledging to help Ukraine meet the reforms asked of it to become a Nato member. They added that the west “remains committed to supporting Ukraine by holding Russia accountable” through sanctions and by punishing “war crimes and other atrocities”. An MP has called upon the deputy prime minister to delve into the depths of his soul and condemn the Home Office’s decision to paint over an asylum centre children’s mural. PA reports that the SNP’s Pete Wishart criticised the lack of compassion and concern demonstrated by ministers in response to what he described as a “grotesque” ask. The decision to paint over murals of cartoon characters, including Mickey Mouse and Baloo from The Jungle Book, at an asylum seeker reception centre in Kent was made by immigration minister Robert Jenrick, who reportedly felt they were too “welcoming”. Speaking in the Commons on Tuesday, though, Jenrick said the murals were painted over because they were not “age appropriate” for the majority of the young people staying there. When challenged by Wishart at prime minister’s questions, Oliver Dowden emphasised the government’s determination to combat the “vile” people smuggling trade and condemned those involved in exploiting vulnerable women and children. Perth and North Perthshire MP Mr Wishart told the Commons: “I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything quite so grotesque as the painting-over of Mickey Mouse on a children’s mural, as was done by the Home Office in a detention centre in Kent. No minister so far has raised the necessary compassion or concern to speak out about this. “So can I ask the Deputy prime minister to look into the deeper recesses of his soul and just simply condemn it?” Dowden replied: “I’ll tell him what real compassion looks like and that means stopping the vile people smuggling trade across the Channel condemning women and children to death. “This government is taking action to deal with it, with our stop the boats bill, and that party shamefully 18 times last night voted against it.” At PMQs, Angela Rayner repeated John Prescott’s question from 1996 – “Why is it that in Tory Britain tens of thousands of families are facing repossession, negative equity and homelessness?” – and asked why she should need to ask the same question 27 years later, as she challenged Oliver Dowden on child poverty and the “Tory mortgage bombshell”. Dowden and Rayner were standing in for the prime minister and the Labour leader as Rishi Sunak attended a Nato summit in Vilnius. The joint chief executive of Thames Water has refused to apologise for allowing water companies to increase their debt during her time as chief of Ofwat, the water regulator. Cathryn Ross’s comments came during a parliamentary committee session with Thames Water bosses as concerns mount over the financial viability of the company. Thames Water has secured £750m of emergency funding from its shareholders but the debt-ridden company warned it would need further funding in the years ahead. The independent MP Angus MacNeil will not return to the SNP group after his suspension expires, he has announced. The Western Isles MP has criticised the party’s independence strategy, saying he will not return to the Westminster group until at least after the SNP conference in October if they provide “clarity on independence”, PA News reports. In a letter he published on Twitter, MacNeil said: I will only seek the SNP whip again if it is clear that the SNP are pursuing independence. At the moment, the SNP has become a brand name missing the key ingredient. The urgency for independence is absent. He added: The Scottish government went to the supreme court a year ago utterly clueless about how to pursue independence, left the supreme court utterly clueless about how to pursue independence. The SNP still have no clear understanding that it has to use elections to negotiate Scottish independence from Westminster by getting the backing of the majority of the electorate. The SNP members must have a say at conference on the policy direction, which is hasn’t until now. The appointments of the current and previous chairs of the water regulator Ofwat should be investigated, campaigners have said, as the Liberal Democrats called for the watchdog to be abolished. Jonson Cox, a former chair of the regulator, had multimillion-pound links with the privatised water industry before taking up the role. The current chair, Iain Coucher, remains a senior adviser to a global private equity firm that has interests in the water industry in the US. Cox and Coucher declared all their interests when they were appointed by the government. Campaigners say their respective appointments represent a failure of the system and have written to Thérèse Coffey, the environment secretary, calling for an independent investigation. Ofwat is under increasing pressure because of the scale of debts England’s water companies have been allowed to build up – £60bn – while paying out more than £72bn in dividends since privatisation. Ultimately the environment secretary is responsible for the appointment of the chair of the regulator. Ash Smith, an activist from the group Windrush Against Sewage Pollution, said in the letter to Coffey: The failure of the regulators is now obvious, so the reasons why supposedly highly regulated water companies have done so well by exploiting captive bill-payers should, we think, be an important subject for the secretary of state ultimately responsible for the sewage scandal. ‘Regulatory capture’ or worse are obvious features that surely require investigation. I urge you to order an independent investigation, but this time to extend across the board of water industry regulation; to include the influence of conflicting interests and the revolving door of employment between the regulated and the regulator. Tim Farron, the environment spokesperson for the Lib Dems, supported calls for an inquiry into the regulator and the industry as a whole on Wednesday. The party is calling for Ofwat to be abolished and replaced with a more powerful new regulator.

The prime minister’s official spokesperson said: “We are still working through that process.” He said the government, with the target of cutting inflation, would “need to consider those recommendations carefully”. He told reporters: We are looking at all of those recommendations in the round and are working through the process. We haven’t made a final decision on accepting them. The spokesperson indicated that there would be concerns about borrowing to fund pay rises. Clearly, borrowing to fund double-digit pay rises ... we think would be inflationary, so we need to consider in the round. Here’s some reaction to today’s PMQs: Rachel Wearmouth, deputy political editor of the New Statesman says Rayner demolished Dowden. The Mirror’s Whitehall correspondent Mikey Smith says Dowden was like a substitute teacher unable to control the class. Columnist for the Evening Standard and the iPaper Ayesha Hazarika said Dowden’s attempt at a joke was painful. Noa Hoffman, political reporter of the Sun says the whole thing was painful. John Rentoul, chief political commentator, the Independent, said Dowden’s cliches were dreadful. Cat Smith of Labour asks Dowden about plans to close ticket offices, which she says is “yet another cost-of-living bombshell” hitting constituents. Dowden says it is important railways continue to “reform” after the “record amount of money we gave them during Covid”. He adds that if Smith is concerned about people’s ability to take trains she should condemn “totally unjustified” strikes. Mhairi Black, the SNP’s deputy Westminster leader, asked about the rise in mortgage rates, which she says are have surpassed the levels seen after the “disastrous mini-budget” by Kwasi Kwarteng. She asks: How high do they need to go until he and his government takes it seriously? In response, Dowden says “the driver of higher mortgage rates is higher inflation”. He adds that this is driven by the war in Ukraine and disruption in the supply chain due to Covid, adding that Sunak plans to halve inflation. Black responds that it has been forecast that mortgages could rise by another £500 for a million households. She says: The prime minister says people need to hold their nerve. She added that people need help “right now”. Pete Wishart brings up the order from the immigration minister, Robert Jenrick to repaint murals of cartoon characters including Mickey Mouse painted on the walls of an asylum seeker reception centre He said: I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything quite so grotesque as the painting over of Micky Mouse on a children’s mural as was done by the Home Office at a detention centre. No Tory Minister has roused the necessary compassion or concern to speak out about this. So can I ask the Deputy PM too look into the deeper recesses of his soul and just simply condem it? Oliver Dowden responds by deflecting: I’ll tell [Pete Wishart] what real compassion looks like. Stopping the vile people smuggling trade across the channel, condemning women and children to death. The SNP shamefully 18 times last night voted against our Stop the Boats Bill. Oliver Dowden: It is this party, not the party opposite, which extended free school meals to all five, six and seven-year-olds, something the party opposite failed to do, and it sits alongside many measures we’re taking to help people with the cost of living. Dowden went on to highlight further government support, adding: It may come as a surprise to (Ms Rayner) but balancing the books means more than working out how many millions to take from her union paymasters. Oliver Dowden says Labour says it is the party of working people, but under their plans, people can’t even get to work, with Just Stop Oil protesters “blocking our roads”, “their union paymasters stopping our trains” and the “hated ULEZ stopping cars across our capital”. He says Conservatives get Britain moving while Labour is just “standing in everyone’s way”. Angela Rayner: The truth is, rising bills and soaring mortgages and plummeting real wages are pushing more and more families to the brink. Those already struggling are being hit hardest by the Tory mortgage bombshell and rising food costs. Dowden said the government has lifted 400,000 children out of child poverty. He also pointed to measures to cut taxes by “doubling the personal allowance”. He said: That is the surest way to ensure we lift people out of poverty. In response, Rayner doubled down on her comparison to Boris Johnson: It’s like the ghost of prime minister past is still here. She told Dowden to be careful about the stats he uses. She said her counterpart can’t solve child poverty if he doesn’t acknowledge the problem. She then asked: How many kids don’t have a permanent address today, compared to when Labour left office in 2010? Dowden fumbled as he didn’t seem to have an answer. Angela Rayner accused Oliver Dowden of taking tips from Boris Johnson as the pair clashed over child poverty and homelessness in the UK. She said: I think he’s taking tips from the former prime minister on telling the facts. The last Labour government worked hard to dramatically reduce the number of children in temporary accommodation. But under the Tories, the number of homeless children has risen by 75%. I’m proud of our record on tackling child poverty. Rayner then asked if Dowden is ashamed of the Tory record. Lots of laughs in the Commons has Oliver Dowden makes a poorly executed dig about Keir Starmer and tree huggers (for reference, Starmer apparently hates them). He says: They seem very keen on hugging that magic money tree. Angela Rayner points out the last time the deputies stood in at PMQs two weeks running was in 1996. She says she’s proud to be in the same place John Prescott once stood, before pointing at Oliver Dowden: “He’s no Heseltine.” Inspired by John Prescott’s question back in 1996, she points out that “tens of 1000s of families are facing repossession and homelessness” due to the ‘Tory mortgage bombshell”. Oliver Dowden says he won’t take a lecture on housing policy from the Labour party and points out that his parents would not have been able to buy their own home if it were not for Margaret Thatcher. Oliver Dowden has kicked off PMQs by pointing out that he is covering for Rishi Sunak, who is at the Nato summit. He begins by pledging that the Tories will “continue to invest” in renewable energy, before stressing the UK must also invest in “energy independence”. He says: “That means investing in the North Sea,” warning that if we don’t there will be higher carbon emissions “as we import from elsewhere”. Dowden is then asked about Labour plans to “tax education of choice”. He says schools are concerned “this will apply to them as well”. The deputy prime minister said these Labour plans could cost £300m. Ofwat chief executive David Black told MPs taxpayers would face some extra costs if Thames Water was placed into a so-called special administration regime (SAR), but that these would be far lower than seen after the collapse of Bulb. He said water companies have very large assets, which would help limit the cost to taxpayers. Black said: We do accept that there is a risk to taxpayers and that’s one of the reasons why we’ve been working to drive increased financial resilience into companies. He said the regulator was still on standby to place Thames Water into an SAR, but that it was not an immediate risk, given the recent pledge by investors to pump more cash into the firm. Black said: It’s prudent planning to be ready for SAR. We need to be ready to deploy that. It’s great that the company has secured the commitment from shareholders but the money has not yet arrived. At that point, we will feel more confident. Oliver Dowden, the deputy prime minister, will be taking PMQs shortly. He is facing Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader. Dowden is at the dispatch box. Rishi Sunak, who currently has the worst attendance rate at PMQs for a PM since 1979, is at the Nato summit in in Vilnius. Here’s what to expect from the House of Commons order paper: At 12 noon Oral Questions to the Prime Minister Q1: Steven Bonnar (Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill) Whether he has made an assessment of the impact of a potential reduction in oil production by Saudi Arabia and Russia on domestic energy prices. Q2 Craig Mackinlay (South Thanet) If he will list his official engagements for Wednesday 12 July. Q3 Pete Wishart (Perth and North Perthshire) Q4 Cat Smith (Lancaster and Fleetwood) Q5 Mr John Baron (Basildon and Billericay) Q6 Jane Stevenson (Wolverhampton North East) Q7 Kenny MacAskill (East Lothian) Q8 Hywel Williams (Arfon) Q9 John Spellar (Warley) Q10 Anne McLaughlin (Glasgow North East) Q11 Dan Carden (Liverpool, Walton) Q12 Kit Malthouse (North West Hampshire) Q13 Bim Afolami (Hitchin and Harpenden) Q14 Wera Hobhouse (Bath) Q15 Vicky Ford (Chelmsford) Simon Case told MPs that some people had sought to “weaponise” the Sue Gray row amid broader attacks on the civil service. The cabinet secretary criticised the use of the term “the blob”, a phrase deployed often by some Tory MPs to attack the civil service and officials. Taking questions from the Tory MP David Jones about whether the Partygate investigator’s move to join Sir Keir Starmer’s team had stoked concerns, Case said: Actually, it has been particularly important that we assure ourselves and ministers that ministers are comfortable and happy that the impartiality of the civil service has been upheld. They are satisfied it has. Undoubtedly, there are people who have sought to weaponise this case. On the use of the term “the blob” more generally, Case said: There has always been language that has been around for people to express their frustrations – [at] the establishment, the system. I think this is a bit different. I fear it is being used in a very modern, dehumanising way. There are legitimate frustrations within the system. He told Jones, as a former minister, “you would have raised them privately through the proper channels”. The Treasury’s tax and spending watchdog is preparing to sound the alarm over the impact of rising interest rates on the public finances, delivering a serious blow to the government’s scope for pre-election tax cuts. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility will warn that stubbornly high inflation and soaring borrowing costs are adding to the challenges facing Rishi Sunak, making it less likely that he will meet one of his five key pledges: tackling Britain’s public debt. It is understood the OBR will produce a range of scenarios in its annual “fiscal risks and sustainability report” on Thursday, setting out the impact of higher interest rates for the public purse, in a warning that sustained pressure could force it to tear up its official forecasts. The watchdog said it would “assess the fiscal implications of recent rises in global interest rates, consider the vulnerability of the UK’s current debt position, and explore the challenges in getting debt to fall in the coming years”. Read the full story by my colleague Richard Partington here: Civil service chief Simon Case said the last five years had seen a deterioration in relations between officials and politicians, although he added the situation had improved since Rishi Sunak became prime minister, PA News reports. The cabinet secretary told MPs: The last five years or so have seen, I think, an increased number of attacks on civil servants individually and collectively by significant political figures which has undoubtedly undermined the good functioning of government. I’m very happy to say that under this prime minister things have changed very significantly. He said the tone of ministers talking about civil servants in public had “changed quite significantly”. Asked about attacks on the establishment “blob” by current and recent ministers, Case said the prime minister had rejected that term. Case added: Obviously I don’t agree with a characterisation which is insulting, dehumanising, totally unacceptable. It would surprise me if current ministers were using this language, not least because if they were it would indicate something akin to self-defeating cowardice. Tory MP William Wragg asked Simon Case if he was aware of “any rather forceful communications” sent by Nadine Dorries “to senior civil servants” about potentially using “the platform of the Commons and indeed her own television programme to get to the bottom of why she hadn’t been given a peerage?” The cabinet secretary said: Yes, was aware of those communications and have flagged them to both the chief whip and Speaker of the House. Asked during the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee session if he had taken legal advice on whether the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925 could “come into play”, the top civil servant said he was “seeking further advice on that question. So taken initial advice, but asked for more.” Cabinet Secretary Simon Case has rejected Boris Johnson’s criticism of partygate investigator and former civil servant Sue Gray. Appearing before the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee, he was pressed by MPs on the circumstances surrounding Gray’s decision to take up a job with Sir Keir Starmer. Asked about Johnson’s remarks, Case said he did not speak for the former prime minister. He said: We found no evidence that Sue’s report was affected by party political considerations. And actually I am not sure the timeline, as we now understand it from the material in the Acoba (Advisory Committee on Business Appointments) judgment, quite works. Sue’s report was produced early in 2022, her first contact as we understand it from the material she provided to Acoba was in October 2022. So there seems to be a timeline, a gap, as well. A senior civil servant has offered a “sincere apology” to a chemical weapons expert who was blacklisted from speaking at a conference after finding tweets that were critical of the government. Earlier this year, my colleague Dan Sabbagh reported that Dan Kaszeta had been disinvited by The Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), commonly known as Porton Down, from giving a keynote speech at a UK-run expert conference after civil servants discovered social media posts he wrote criticising Conservative ministers and government migration policy. Kaszeta was one of at least eight speakers banned from government events by an opaque vetting scheme introduced by Jacob Rees-Mogg in 2022, a policy that the banned expert described as an attack on free speech. In January, government officials asked Kaszeta, who has more than 25 years’ experience in the field, to address the Chemical Weapons Demilitarisation Conference in London. He said the officials offered to waive a registration fee so he would speak. But in early April, that offer was withdrawn when a civil servant wrote to him to explain that new government rules required that “the social media accounts of potential speakers must be vetted” before they could speak at official events. “The check on your social media has identified materials that criticised government officials and policy,” the email continued, without indicating which postings were deemed unacceptable, or offering Kaszeta a right of appeal. In a letter, seen by The Guardian, Paul Hollinshead, the chief executive of Porton Down, has admitted that its decision was based on an analysis of Kaszeta’s Twitter activity and was improper. Hollinshead wrote: I am writing to offer my sincere apologies for Dstl’s error in rescinding your invitation to the Chemical Weapons Demilitarisation Conference in May this year. This decision was incorrectly taken following informal checks of your social media posts and due to a misapplication of Cabinet Office guidance which was referred to in media reports and which only applies to Cabinet office staff events. This was not in accordance Dstl’s process for organising events. Kaszeta, writing today in The Times, said that being banned was “bad for my career” and bad for democracy. He said that the apology was a vindication for him but did not go far enough. He said: Apologies to other victims of blacklisting would be even better . . . secret blacklists are indefensible in a modern democracy. The fact that a policy was applied to me in error does not address the issue that they exist. Jeremy Hunt has told ministers there will be no extra money to give millions of public sector workers an average 6% pay rise, potentially leaving departments facing a difficult choice between raising salaries or cutting frontline services. The Guardian understands the chancellor has ruled out providing a further cash injection beyond what is already budgeted if Rishi Sunak decides to implement the recommendations of independent pay review bodies, which are expected as soon as Thursday. Government sources said the decision over whether to back the proposal for no more funding would only be made once the prime minister was back from the Nato summit in Vilnius on Wednesday night and had gone over the figures. “There’s definitely still contention in this,” one said. Cabinet ministers have been urging Sunak to agree to adopt the recommendations against a backdrop of the rising cost of living and amid concerns that public sector strikes could continue in the run-up to the next general election. Senior Conservatives are concerned they will have to cut frontline services across education, health and policing if they are expected to fund the estimated £5bn difference between budgeted increases of 3.5% and the pay review body recommendations. Read more on this story here: Nadine Dorries has written a book titled The Plot: The Political Assassination of Boris Johnson, due to be published days before the Tory Party conference in September. The former prime minister’s staunch ally claims to have uncovered a “fault line” within the Conservative Party through conversations with cabinet ministers, civil servants and party officials which form the basis of her account, PA News reports. The book, for which Dorries received £20,500 as a partial advance from HarperCollins, is billed as the story of “treachery and deceit at the heart of the Westminster machine”. It is set to hit the stands on September 28 – just three days before Conservatives convene for the annual party conference on October 1. The former culture secretary said: I had wanted to discover the forces behind the downfall of the prime minister. Instead, I found a fault line within the Conservative party stretching back decades, and a history of deception fuelled by the darkest political arts. If you thought that power flowed from the people into Parliament, be prepared to think again. Dorries was among eight Conservative parliamentarians recently rebuked for her conduct in relation to the Privileges Committee investigation of Johnson. Rishi Sunak and Volodymyr Zelensky met earlier for a bilateral on the fringes of the Nato summit in Vilnius. The prime minister suggested the pair meet without aides present, with the Ukrainian president agreeing that there should be “only two” of them in the room. Sunak told his counterpart: It is good to see you here at Nato where you belong. Zelensky thanked Sunak for helping secure additional security guarantees for Kyiv, with a G7 deal due to be signed on Wednesday in the Lithuanian capital. He also tweeted that negotiations with the UK “always enhance global security”. Zelensky said he wanted to use his meeting with Sunak to talk about security guarantees for Kyiv. The prime minister told him there had been “real progress” on that matter. He said: What your soldiers are doing on the front line, it is inspiring to everyone. We’re proud to have played a part in training some of them. They have served with enormous bravery and courage. Zelensky said the training missions in the UK had been “very important”, with Sunak adding it was clear the exercises had “been put to good use”. You can follow our dedicated liveblog on the Russia-Ukraine war here: Michael Gove’s department is handing back £1.9bn to the Treasury originally meant to tackle England’s housing crisis after struggling to find projects to spend it on. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) has surrendered hundreds of millions of pounds budgeted for 2022-23, including £255m meant to fund new affordable housing and £245m meant to improve building safety. Officials said the department was unable to spend the money, which accounts for about a third of its entire housing budget, thanks to rising interest rates and uncertainty in the housing market after the Covid-19 pandemic. But experts warn the lack of investment is likely to exacerbate the housing crisis in England, where homebuilding is forecast to drop to its lowest level since the second world war. Jack Shaw, a local government expert who uncovered the figures through a freedom of information request, said: The government is experiencing significant challenges investing in housing because of a perfect storm in market conditions. But the decision to delay housing investment or withdraw it altogether as a result of lower than anticipated spending will mean fewer homes are built. Read the full story by my colleague Kiran Stacey here: Thames Water bosses are being questioned by MPs on the at the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee over the company’s financial viability. The interim joint chief executive of Thames Water said leadership at the troubled supplier is “very focused on turning this business around”. Alastair Cochran told MPs: I was brought in with a whole new executive team to turn around this business. This business matters - it serves 15 million customers. Our job collectively is turn this business around. We know performance both operationally and financially hasn’t been where it needs to be. We’ve been very transparent about that. We are very focused on turning this business around, making it sure it is financially resilient and delivers a better service for customers, and improves both its operational and environmental performance. The chairman of the water supplier has told MPs that the departure of its former boss Sarah Bentley last month was surprising. Sir Adrian Montague said: I think Sarah’s resignation was a surprise. I think she had got to the point perhaps of feeling that the burdens of office were considerable and it was an entirely personal decision, with which I think we had no involvement. My colleague Alex Lawson wrote this piece yesterday which explains what has been going on: Rishi Sunak is set to host all Tory MPs for morale-boosting hog roast at Downing Street tonight, as he misses his second PMQs in a row. The prime minister is still in Lithuania, where he is attending a two-day Nato summit and meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, president of Ukraine. He’s due to fly back to the UK this evening in time to welcome his guests and try to instil some positivity over his party’s struggle to recover in the polls and the prospect of them potentially losing in all three by-elections taking place next week on 20 July. All MPs, regardless of allegiances are reportedly invited including Nadine Dorries who is set to trigger the fourth by-election battle of the summer.

      "politics\/2023\/jul\/08\/tory-brexiter-george-eustice-visas-young-eu-workers-labour-shortage A leading Tory Brexiter on Sunday calls on ministers to reopen the UK’s borders to tens of thousands of young workers from EU nations in order to tackle acute post-Brexit labour shortages that he says are driving up inflation. In an extraordinary admission of the failures of immigration policy since the UK left the EU, former Tory environment secretary George Eustice said Rishi Sunak’s government should begin bilateral negotiations with EU nations immediately, with a view to offering young Europeans under 35 the right to two- year visas to work in this country. Eustice, who was secretary of state for the environment, food and rural affairs under Boris Johnson, said the deals should be reciprocal so that young UK citizens under 35 would be able to live and work for two years in the same EU member states with which deals were struck. This, he said, would be part of a much-needed “post-Brexit reconciliation” with our European neighbours. Speaking exclusively to the Observer, Eustice, who is leaving parliament at the next election, was highly critical of the Home Office, saying its skills-based immigration rules were failing the country on many levels. Referring to the list of professions allowed to work here, he said: “The flaws in our current so-called skills-based immigration system are becoming clearer by the day because we have got a policy that does not correspond to the needs of our economy. “We are allowing in people who are deemed skilled such as lawyers, insolvency practitioners, museum officers, even disc jockeys, when we have no shortages whatsoever in those sectors. But we are not allowing people to come here to work in sectors like the food industry, even though there are acute labour shortages in these sectors, and that is contributing to inflation. “So that is the big problem. My proposal is that we commence bilateral negotiations with EU member states, starting with countries like Bulgaria, Romania and the Baltic states, and widen it to the whole of the EU eventually, to establish a reciprocal youth-mobility visa scheme.” Asked if labour shortages and resulting inflationary pressures had been caused by Brexit, Eustice said: “I think we have to stop seeing everything through the prism of Brexit. This isn’t because of Brexit. But it is because of the failure of our post-Brexit immigration policy.” His comments, which expose the deep splits within the Tory party over immigration, also show how determined some ardent Brexiters are becoming to shift Tory policy in order to try to limit the damage that leaving the EU is causing to the economy and labour market. He blamed Theresa May when she was prime minister for failing to adopt bilateral visa schemes with EU countries after Brexit, which he said he had always supported. “This idea of having no temporary visa schemes was not from the Vote Leave campaign,” Eustice said. “It came predominantly from Theresa May. It was a remainer’s interpretation of what Brexit was about. That was not what Brexit was about. People wanted controlled immigration and not to pull up the drawbridge and allow no one in at all.” In May the home secretary, Suella Braverman, told a National Conservatism conference that there was “no good reason why we can’t train up enough HGV drivers, butchers or fruit pickers” in this country to fill any labour shortages. Eustice said the Home Office misunderstood the situation with seasonal workers, who did not count towards immigration figures as they were only here for six months. It was important that the Tory party separated the debates about legal and illegal immigration and stopped resorting to “profoundly unhelpful” rhetoric. Eustice, who comes from a farming family in the West Country, added that Home Office policy was pushing up immigration numbers rather than controlling them, because those allowed in under the skills-based system were told they had to settle permanently, and as a result brought partners and children with them. By contrast, his visa scheme would be for individuals alone and would last for only two years, after which people would have to return home. When the UK was a member of the EU, all UK citizens were able to travel and work freely in the EU under freedom of movement rules. But those automatic rights were extinguished with Brexit. UK citizens now trying to work in the EU face a range of bureaucratic requirements and different rules, with some countries demanding visas and others specific job offers. Eustice, who started his political career as a member of Ukip, said his scheme, which he is planning to submit to government advisers, would mean many tens of thousands of young EU workers coming to this country to fill vacancies. Labour shortages have affected mainly the food, restaurants, pubs and hospitality sectors, and are driving up wages and prices in the shops, accentuating the cost of living crisis. Eustice said he was not calling for a return for the UK to EU freedom of movement but for a solution to benefit Britain and its neighbours. “It is really important as part of that reconciliation that we rekindle that post Brexit friendship with our European neighbours.” Last week, in a sign of growing Tory turmoil over immigration, a new group of Conservative MPs called on the government to cut a special visa scheme for care workers as part of a plan to reduce immigration by about 400,000 by the next general election. The proposals, backed by 20 MPs, including allies of Braverman, were firmly rejected by Downing Street. Most EU governments would actively welcome more cross-Channel mobility for young people, from school groups and university students to interns and first-jobbers. Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said on a visit to London in January that Berlin wanted “practical EU achievements” such as youth exchange programmes and mobility reflected in Germany’s new relationship with the UK. “This is about looking to the future after Brexit,” Baerbock said. Germany and the UK “need to build new bridges in youth exchange, worker mobility, university students and research – in short, in all the areas where people come together.” Paris has been somewhat less forthcoming – notably on possible bilateral arrangements – but France’s consul general in London, Samer Melki, said last week he was “preoccupied” by the new relationship between the two nations. Non-tourist travel has become “much harder, especially for young people”, he said. “It is really very difficult now to come to the UK to do a work experience placement, to be an au pair or just to do casual work for a while.” If young French and British people “cannot meet each other any more, cannot learn more about each other even during school visits, which have become much more difficult, it risks putting the two societies on diverging tracks”. France’s Europe ministry said last month that talks on “bilateral mobility issues” had resumed after Sunak’s visit to Paris, but warned “balances must be maintained” and the Brexit TCA (trade and cooperation agreement) terms must be “properly implemented”. A Home Office spokesperson said: “We already have successful youth mobility schemes with 10 countries, including Australia and New Zealand, and remain open to agreeing them with our international partners, including EU members.” “We work … closely with the Migration Advisory Committee to ensure our points-based system delivers for the UK and works in the best interests of the economy, including reviewing the shortage occupation list to ensure it reflects the current labour market.”\n",
      "politics\/2023\/jul\/07\/tory-mps-snipe-at-rishi-sunak-five-pledges-amid-polling-concerns Progress on meeting Rishi Sunak’s “five pledges” has privately come under fire from Conservative MPs this week, six months on from his urge to be judged on delivering what he called the “people’s priorities”. Jitters have extended all the way into Downing Street, with the prime minister’s senior aides traipsing across Whitehall to raise concerns about how the pledges are landing with the public. Slides from a presentation given by No 10 media advisers to press officers working in government departments, seen by the Guardian, admit: “We still have a problem with cut-through.” Citing internal polling, the presentation said 67% of people were unclear what the UK government’s priorities were, despite No 10’s efforts to hammer them home across speeches and set-piece announcements. A data tracker was said to have found that a lower proportion of the public had reported hearing “government talk” about “all key narrative themes”, compared with the previous month. Continuing to be blighted by what one senior Tory MP called the “landmines” of Boris Johnson’s administration, the government has found itself blown off course. In a sign that Downing Street is wary of its winning 2019 voter coalition falling apart at the next election, press officers across the government were instructed at the meetings this week to focus on key audiences to reach. An “audience segmentation” included in the presentation said cost of living and economy messages should be targeted at lower-income working families, and those who are out of work and struggling to make ends meet. Migration messaging should be focused on working-age people outside London and those disengaged with the government, with key health audiences identified as frequent GP visitors, elective surgery patients and those with a chronic disease, the presentation suggested. A No 10 source said the work was about “ensuring the public are aware that the government is focused on delivering their priorities”. They added a new approach was being taken to focus “on key audiences who are particularly impacted by policies or who are shown to be less engaged with policies that could impact them”. Despite its best efforts, however, the government appears stuck in limbo in the run-up to recess and three looming byelections (with a further two possibly on the horizon). A lack of legislation means the Commons is missing its buzz, a deliberate tactic to let MPs spend much-needed time shoring up support in their constituencies. However, Tory frontbenchers complain the air is one of malaise. One bemoaned becoming what they described as a “zombie government”, not helped by Sunak being absent for several set-piece sessions of prime minister’s questions. It is natural for Commons business to slow down towards summer, particularly when the end of the parliamentary session approaches. Preparations turn instead to the final year’s legislative programme before the general election. But Tory MPs complain that the country is not short of problems, and Keir Starmer’s Labour is snapping at their heels. Despite Sunak’s pledges on the economy, NHS and immigration, borrowing costs are soaring while inflation remains stubbornly high, the Rwanda plan is still stalled and waiting lists may climb higher still. Recent polling showed “the gap between the parties widening in the past few weeks – undoing a lot of the Conservative polling gains since early in the year”, noted Prof Will Jennings, an elections expert at the University of Southampton. Most government insiders think a reshuffle, about which there has been much speculation, is likely to be held back until after the three byelection results that will be delivered in the early hours of Friday 21 July. But some MPs dispatched to the campaign trail feel their efforts will be in vain. Somerton and Frome is said to have been treated as a “write-off” given that the investigation into its recently departed MP, David Warburton, has lasted 12 months. “The Lib Dems have had a whole year to prepare and it ticks basically every box for them,” said one government insider, even though the Tories currently have a 19,000 majority there. Selby and Ainsty is proving tough as well. “Apathy is killing us,” said a Conservative MP sent up to canvass there recently. Another who has visited the constituency, which Boris Johnson’s ally Nigel Adams won with a 20,000 majority at the last election, added: “The Labour vote is stronger than expected.” In Uxbridge and South Ruislip, the Tories are more confident about stemming poor turnout by turning the contest into a “referendum on Ulez”, the plan to expand London’s clean air zone by the Labour mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. However, the much slimmer Tory majority in Johnson’s old seat of about 7,000 puts it at greater risk of flipping. Back in Westminster, the summer party season is already in full flow, giving Tory MPs the chance to drown their sorrows. At an event hosted by the Spectator, Sunak was upbeat, but once the prime minister and his senior team had left, MPs and aides openly discussed how they expected to lose the next election. One cabinet minister acknowledged it was “entirely plausible” they would be trounced at the polls, while a former cabinet minister dramatically drew a finger across their throat and said: “Let’s not kid ourselves. It’s game over for us.” Shadow cabinet ministers such as Wes Streeting and Jonathan Ashworth were among an unusual number of Labour figures who joined the throng, with Tory advisers openly sharing tips for government with their counterparts in opposition. One suggested that Labour should desist from criticising any decisions that may have been made by the civil service. “You’ll need them onside when you take over,” they suggested. Despite the sense of dread creeping into growing quarters of the Conservative party, some remain optimistic. They believe Sunak will hit his target of halving inflation by the end of the year, and are counting on Labour to make its own missteps. “We just need the polling gap to close by 1% each month, then you’ll have the left turning on Starmer and it’ll be them losing their heads,” predicted one government insider.\n",

(See 3.46pm.) The Scottish government is challenging Westminster to decriminalise all drugs for personal use, in a fresh attempt to tackle Scotland’s chronically high drug death rates. Murals of cartoon characters, including Mickey Mouse and Baloo from The Jungle Book, painted on the walls of an asylum seeker reception centre to welcome children, have been removed on the orders of the immigration minister, Robert Jenrick. Keir Starmer has said he and the former senior civil servant Sue Gray knew and followed the rules over her appointment as his chief of staff, but admitted to frustrations at not being able to defend the hiring while it was scrutinised by the Whitehall watchdog. Starmer has been accused of “wavering on climate commitments” after the Labour party refused to commit to the £11.6bn climate funding pledge made to the world’s poorest nations. A rightwing lobby group that does not declare its donors is spearheading a campaign to undermine the spread of the four-day week in the UK. Dame Priti Patel, the former home secretary, is leading an attempt to water down the motion being debated on Monday criticising the MPs who spoke out against the privileges committee’s investigation into Boris Johnson. Patel is one of seven Tory MPs accused in a recent privileges committee report of trying to undermine its inquiry into Johnson by publicly denouncing it as biased. On Monday MPs will debate the recent report, and the motion proposed by the committee. Without naming Patel or the other six Tories, it says that when the privileges committee is carrying out an inquiry, MPs “should not impugn the integrity of that committee or its members or attempt to lobby or intimidate those members or to encourage others to do so, since such behaviour undermines the proceedings of the house and is itself capable of being a contempt”. Patel has tabled an amendment that would remove the reference to impugning the integrity of the committee, or intimidating its members. Instead, her motion just says that, when the committee is carrying out an inquiry, MPs “should not attempt personally to lobby or intimidate those members or to encourage others to do so, since such behaviour undermines the proceedings of the house and is itself capable of being a contempt”. No one has accused the seven Tories of trying to personally lobby members of the committee; the accusation is that they maligned them on Twitter, or on the media. If Patel’s amendment were to pass, it would mean she and her six colleagues would avoid the embarrassment to the Commons voting to implicitly condemn their conduct. Brendan Clarke-Smith and Dame Andrea Jenkyns, another two of the seven Tories singled out for criticism by the privileges committee, have signed Patel’s amendment. The other four Tories – Nadine Dorries, Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, Mark Jenkinson and Sir Michael Fabricant – have not yet signed it. Patel, Jenkyns, Rees-Mogg and Fabricant were all included in Johnson’s resignation honours. Dorries was expecting to be included, too, but her peerage was blocked. Wendy Chamberlain, the Lib Dem MP, has tabled an alternative amendment saying all seven Tories named in the report should face an investigation over claims they committed a contempt of parliament. It is for the speaker to decide whether amendments are called, and it is possible that he could decide that neither should be put to a vote. Turning back to benefit overpayments and underpayments (see 12.32pm), in the comments Dora73 asks: Is the rise in the DWP fraud figures not explained by Covid\/furlough\/job retention scheme false\/fraudulent\/over claims? The answer seems to be yes. This chart shows overpayment rates, according to when a claim started, and it shows that claims lodged during the first lockdown have a far higher overpayment rate than other claims. “Overpayment”, in this context, covers fraudulent claims as well as mistakes. At the height of the pandemic some of the usual checks were eased to ensure that people got money quickly. BMA Scotland has called off a planned strike by junior doctors after the Scottish government offered them a 12.4% pay rise. The award follows a 4.5% pay rise in 2022-23, leading to a cumulative increase of 17.5% over two years. The Scottish government said the pay deal amounted to a £61.3m investment in junior doctors’ pay and that this was the best pay offer for this group in the UK. Michael Matheson, the health secretary in the Scottish government, said: Following months of negotiations with BMA Scotland, I am delighted that we have agreed a pay deal for 2023-24 for our junior doctors. BMA have agreed to suspend strike action in Scotland while they consult with their members. I hope this investment and the significant commitments we have given around pay and contract reform will show junior doctors how much we value them, and that we are determined to ensure that Scotland is the place for junior doctors to work and train. Dr Chris Smith, the chair of the BMA’s Scottish junior doctors committee, said his negotiating team had reached the limit of what it thought it could achieve this year and that it did not think strike action would achieve a better offer. “As a result, we have agreed to suspend next week’s strikes and put this offer to our members,” he said. He went on: This offer commits the government to working with doctors to restore our pay and prevent pay erosion from occurring in the future. This is an unprecedented shift from the Scottish government, which is a recognition of the huge decline in real-terms pay that doctors have experienced over the past 15 years, and the huge amount of work needed to undo the damage this has caused to the NHS. By agreeing to address the way our pay has been cut, and setting out a clear mechanism for doing so, the government is making a serious, welcome commitment to ensuring that pay for junior doctors in Scotland is restored to a fair level. In England, where junior doctors have also been on strike, the UK government has offered 5%. The BMA says it wants a 26% pay rise, to restore pay to the equivalent level it was in 2008. The Scottish government says its offer means someone starting out as a junior doctor would get a pay rise of £3,429 in 2023-24. Someone much more senior would get a pay rise of £7,111. The term junior doctor is a misnomer, because it refers to all hospital doctors below consultant level. In other workplaces most of them would not be considered junior at all. Rishi Sunak has been urged to set out guidance as to how political parties should and shouldn’t use artificial intelligence when they campaign in the general election. The Demos thinktank says that, with major elections due next year in countries including the US, the UK, India, Australia and Mexico, this will be “the first major electoral cycle in the era of widespread generative AI” and that the risk of voters being misled by AI content is high. In a letter to Sunak, Polly Curtis, the head of Demos, said that, while legislation covering this problem was likely to come at some point in the future, it would probably be too late for the general election. She said Sunak and other party leaders should act now. She told the PM: We are calling on all the major UK political parties to play their part in trying to safeguard the integrity of our democratic processes by developing and publishing policies about how they will use generative AI in their campaigning, setting out what they will and won’t understand as an acceptable use, how they will protect personal data within that and how they will be transparent with voters about their use of AI. Explaining the scale of the problem, she said: We are growing increasingly concerned about the potential for the digital disruption around elections to be rapidly amplified in coming months by the ease with which the new technology can be accessed and deployed. This could look like AI-generated images of candidates doing heroic things, that never happened. Or it could be attack adverts on opponents, that are simply made up. At some point, a political candidate will give a speech that was written with ChatGPT that contains ‘hallucinated’ statistics. This doesn’t need to be officially sanctioned – you just need one campaign volunteer to get over-enthusiastic with the technology and you have a misinformation row on your hands that will make voters mistrust more of the information that they see. Beyond political actors, the risks continue: women politicians who already face online hate on a daily basis will find manipulated, sexualised images of them circulating – such as pornographic deepfakes. Or outside actors looking to subvert democracy could create AI flooding social media with false or misleading information about the election. Curtis’s colleague Ellen Judson, the head of the Centre for the Analysis of Social Media at Demos, has written more about the problem in an article for the Guardian which you can read here. The Scottish government is not just proposing decriminalising drugs for personal use; in its policy paper, it suggests there should be a debate about legalising drugs, within a regulated market. It floats the idea of setting up a citizens’ assembly to consider the proposition. It says: Decriminalisation for personal supply, as with prohibition, provides no additional control over the market and essentially continues to leave it in the hands of organised crime. It continues to provide revenue to fund other illegal activity, further driving violence and crime in our communities. It also accepts that there can be no quality or safety controls on the substances people are consuming, something we simply wouldn’t accept with other, legal and regulated harmful products like alcohol or tobacco. While we do not currently advocate for this policy, implementing a more evidence-based approach to drugs policy could be the basis for considering the potential of introducing regulated markets for the reduction of harm and the safe control of substances. This could be supported by a citizens’ assembly to consider the evidence and give a perspective from a representative sample of the public. This would enable a mature, informed conversation about the level of regulation and control that we as a society are comfortable with for substances, based on an expert assessment of their relative harms. A debate of this kind could consider the many ways in which substances could be regulated, including licensed sales, expanded pharmacy provision or state run monopolies and the means for achieving this. Which measures are most appropriate for which drug should be determined by the evidence. A considered, methodical and cautious approach would be essential. In Canada’s regulated cannabis market a staged approach was taken, introducing new products slowly over time. Starting with strict regulation allows for the possibility for later easing, if and when evidence and evaluation proves that it is safe to do so. Here is an extract from the Scottish government’s policy paper explaining why it is advocating decriminalising drugs for personal use. The document is laden with footnotes (there are 92 of them, for just 12 pages of text – that’s why they are claiming it is “evidence based”) and all the links in this passage lead to documents referenced in the relevant footnote. Using the evidence from other countries, decriminalising drugs for personal use would help and support people rather than criminalise and stigmatise them; freeing individuals from the fear of accessing treatment and support, reducing drug related harms and, ultimately, improving lives. In addition to these critical public health benefits, people who use drugs would no longer be channelled into the criminal justice system, reducing the costs to the justice system. Decriminalisation could result in fewer people being imprisoned and free up law enforcement resources to address other priorities. Decriminalisation is no longer as radical a proposal as it was. In fact, 30 countries around the world have now recognised the harm caused by criminalisation and moved to change their drug laws, in different ways and with varying levels of effectiveness. In 2018, the UN chief executives board, which includes the head of every UN agency agreed the first ‘UN common position supporting the implementation of the international drug control policy through effective inter-agency collaboration’. The common position committed ‘to promote alternatives to conviction and punishment in appropriate cases, including the decriminalisation of drug possession for personal use, and to promote the principle of proportionality, to address prison overcrowding and overincarceration by people accused of drug crimes’. While there are many factors that have an impact on drug use and substance issues – including social, cultural and economic factors – evidence indicates that decriminalisation directs more people into treatment, reduces criminal justice costs, and reduces the negative impact that a criminal conviction can have on a person who uses drugs. While the research base is complex, limited and growing rapidly, the majority of studies on decriminalisation have found that people’s usage tends to remain the same and in cases where usage does increase, the change is generally small and may be limited to adults rather than young people. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, has refused to commit an incoming Labour government to scrapping the two-child benefit cap but signalled it could be lifted in a party review of universal credit. The cap, introduced by David Cameron’s coalition government, means that families on universal credit with more than two children do not get extra funding for additional children unless they are the result of multiple births or conceived by rape or coercion. The policy, criticised by many as a “rape clause”, has been condemned by senior Labour figures. Jonathan Ashworth, Labour’s shadow work and pensions secretary, described it recently as “heinous” and hinted Labour would scrap it. On Thursday, Keir Starmer was asked whether that was party policy, he replied: “That isn’t our policy and if it changes, I’ll let you know.” Critics, including the Scottish Labour MSP Monica Lennon, read that as Starmer ruling out any changes. She posted a tweet describing the policy as “abhorrent”, and saying it should be scrapped. Speaking to reporters during a visit to British Gas’s Scottish training base in Hamilton, Reeves said Labour was focused on tackling the cost of living crisis by extending the windfall tax to soften the impact of soaring inflation and mortgage costs. She implied the future of cap was under consideration, but only if doing so passed her stringent costings tests. She said: [Ashworth] has committed to a fundamental review of how universal credit works across a whole range of areas, because this is not the only area where people have concerns about how universal credit is working. But you’ll know as well that I’ve said everything in our manifesto will be fully costed and fully funded. If we win the next election, we will inherit the worst economic inheritance that any government has ever been bequeathed by its predecessor. And that means that there are things we would like to do that we’re not able to do quite as quickly as we would want. Signalling that the costs of reform were uppermost in her thinking, Reeves said Labour faced “huge demands” from the NHS, transport, the green energy transition. She said it was crucial “everything we do is built on a rock of economic and fiscal stability”. At the Downing Street lobby briefing the No 10 spokesperson confirmed that ministers are still considering the recommendation from the pay review body for teachers’ pay. (See 8.53am.) They are considering what rise might be appropriate in the context of inflationary pressures, the spokesperson said. The spokesperson was also asked if Rishi Sunak supported Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, ordering cartoon murals at an asylum centre for unaccompanied child migrants to be covered up, to stop the place looking too welcoming. (See 11.24am.) The spokesperson said the government did want to deter people from coming to the UK in small boats, but it also wanted to ensure that child migrants in care were safe, secure and supported. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, has said an incoming Labour government would not decriminalise drug supply or possession. “The short answer is no,” she told reporters in Hamilton. She went on: I find it quite stunning this would be a priority for the Scottish government, when we are today talking about the Tory mortgage bombshell. [We’ve] got more than 700,000 people in Scotland on NHS waiting lists. Pick an issue. There are so many issues you could be focusing on. Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, said Scotland had exactly the same drugs misuse laws as the rest of the UK yet its drug death figures were three times higher. “It’s their cuts to alcohol and drug health partnerships; it’s their cuts to rehabilitation beds; it’s the failure to properly invest in mental health services,” he said. He went on: Every single big problem, [the SNP] seek to find a constitutional divide and fight rather than actually using the powers they have to change people’s lives in Scotland. Rachel is absolutely right: people right now are struggling to put food on the table and struggling to get access to NHS treatment that could save their lives. And they’re seeing the Scottish government talking about decriminalising drugs for personal supply. I think they’re going to make themselves look even more out of touch. Sarwar added, however, that he remained in favour of setting up safe consumption rooms – a policy opposed by the Labour leader, Keir Starmer. He said the lord advocate, Dorothy Bain KC, already had the powers to set those up through Scotland’s laws on policing. Humza Yousaf, Scotland’s first minister, has tweeted about his government’s call for Westminister to allow Scotland to decriminalise drugs for personal use, or to introduce this approach throughout the UK. Rather optimistically, he says he is willing to cooperate with Westminster on this approach. But No 10 isn’t so keen. (See 12.40pm.) Yousaf says: Our radical paper on drug law reform calls for an evidence-based and compassionate approach to tackling drug use. While @scotgov absolutely has responsibilities, many of the levers are in the UK Govt’s hands. We’re willing to work with them to enable us to take a bold approach. Downing Street has rejected a call from the Scottish government for it to be allowed to decriminalise all drugs for personal use. The Scottish government has proposed the idea in a policy paper which acknowledges that, because drug policy is reserved to Westminster, Scotland would only be able to implement this approach if the UK government granted it a section 30 order (an opt-out from the reserved power laws in the Scotland Act). Scotland’s drugs policy minister Elena Whitham said: These are ambitious and radical proposals, grounded in evidence, that will help save lives. We want to create a society where problematic drug use is treated as a health, not a criminal matter, reducing stigma and discrimination and enabling the person to recover and contribute positively to society. While we know these proposals will spark debate, they are in line with our public health approach and would further our national mission to improve and save lives. We are working hard within the powers we have to reduce drug deaths, and while there is more we need to do, our approach is simply at odds with the Westminster legislation we must operate within. In response, No 10 said Rishi Sunak has no plans to alter his “tough stance” on drugs. Asked if Sunak was likely to give the Scottish government the powers it wants to alter drug laws, a Downing Street spokesperson replied: No. Whilst I haven’t seen those reports I think I’m confident enough to say that there are no plans to alter our tough stance on drugs. Here is a good question from a reader, which would probably make a good media studies exam question. Yesterday the Guardian reported that the NAO had said that the DWP had underpaid benefits to the tune of £3bn or so. The Daily Mail reported that the NAO had said that benefits had been overpaid to the tune of £8bn or so. Obviously there is a huge discrepancy, which surely can’t just be attributed to the, shall we say, “editorial differences” between the two. Can you shed any light on this, please? The answer, surprisingly, is that both headlines, and both reports, are accurate. The figures come from the Department for Work and Pensions’ annual report and accounts, which contain figures both for the amount of benefits overpaid and for the amount underpaid. Of the £8.3bn that was overpaid, most of that, £6.4bn, was due to fraud, the report says. But some of it was due to error, either by claimants (£1.4bn) or by the DWP (£600m). (These figures add up to £8.4bn, but the report gives £8.3bn as the total – presumably because of rounding up\/rounding down.) The document also says that £3.3bn was underpaid – either due to error by the DWP (£1.2bn) or to error by claimants (£2.1bn). You could combine these figures and conclude that, in net terms, the DWP is overpaying by £5bn – although that is not a calculation the DWP makes, because it would involve combining one set of data including the impact of fraud, and another not including fraud. Equally, you could look at the figures and conclude that the DWP is more likely to underpay by mistake than to overpay by mistake – but claimants also seem more likely to underclaim than to overclaim, based on these figures. As for why the Mail and the Guardian chose to report the same set of accounts quite differently, the media studies students can work out what that tells you about the politics of both papers. You can make a case for choosing both angles. The Mail would say £8.3bn is the bigger number, and therefore it is the most important part of the story. The Mail also says this is “more than double the £4.1bn estimated to have been overpaid in 2018-19” – although this formula overlooks the fact that, year on year, the amount lost through overpayments is going down (hence the green arrow in the table). By focusing on the £3.3bn, the Guardian was highlighting something more unexpected, and “new’ in the figures. Underpayments (unlike overpayments) are at their highest level on record. This is why, in its response, the National Audit Office specifically recommends new measures to resolve the underpayments problem, in addition to all the work that already goes on at the DWP to try to reduce overpayments. There are two interesting immigration stories in the papers today. In the Sun, Harry Cole says that in August last year the Home Office drew up a plan to get net migration numbers down by capping the number of visas issued. Priti Patel was home secretary at the time. But Cole says that when the plan was presented to Liz Truss (who made Suella Braverman home secretary), it was rejected. Truss wanted to prioritise growth, and realised that slashing immigration would make this more difficult. Cole says the Home Office plan went much further than anything else the government has done to reduce net migration. He says the cabinet was presented with two options. One was to “pursue actions to reduce total inward migration”. It said: “This could include capping some routes, changing thresholds (skills\/salary), restricting the rights of dependents, and\/or reducing the attractiveness of the graduate visa”. The second option was not to make changes and instead to spin the line that “we have control of inward migration”. But it warned: “A strong narrative will be required to explain the rationale.” The document states the most effective policy lever would be an absolute cap or emergency brake and rated its certainty of success as high. But it warned there would be major effects on critical sectors of the economy that might be hard to defend. According to the Sun, the Home Office document said drastic action was needed in the summer of 2022 to enable the government to meet the 2019 manifesto pledge to get net migration below 225,000. Rishi Sunak has now abandoned that target. And in the i, Arj Singh says “murals of cartoon characters painted on the walls of an asylum centre in Kent for unaccompanied children have been painted over following an order from Robert Jenrick”. Earlier in the week he reported that the immigration minister had ordered staff to cover up the pictures because he did not want the centre to look welcoming. Singh reports: Responding to the news that the murals were painted over, critics said Mr Jenrick was a “heartless” villain who was “guilty of trivial nastiness” while wasting taxpayer money. Shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said: “The idea that painting over murals and removing entertainment for unaccompanied children in immigration centres will somehow stop the boats is utterly absurd. “This is a sign of a chaotic government in crisis, whose failing approach means all they have left is tough talk and cruel and callous policies.” More than half of adults who fled Ukraine because of the war want to stay in the UK even when it is safe to return to their home country, PA Media reports. PA says: Some 52% said they intend to live in the UK most of the time when they feel it is safe to return to Ukraine, according to research by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The majority of these people said this decision was because there are more opportunities for work in the UK, the ONS said. The survey was based on data collected from 10,709 people aged 18 and above between 27 April and 15 May 2023. All those surveyed had been granted a visa under the government schemes launched in the wake of Russia’s invasion, namely the Ukraine Family Scheme, Homes for Ukraine scheme or Ukraine Extension Scheme. The latest government data, up to 27 June, showed that 233,600 Ukraine scheme visas has been issued, and 178,900 visa-holders had arrived in the UK. Ministers could find all four teaching unions going on strike in the autumn if they do not improve their offer to teachers, a union leader said today. Speaking on a picket line outside Oasis Academy South Bank in London, Niamh Sweeney, the deputy secretary of the National Education Union, said: The government needs to think – does it want to come round the table and negotiate now, or does it want the prospect of all four education unions being able to take strike action in September? That would be a real failure on their behalf. She said 40,000 teachers left the profession in England last year and there was currently “an absolute crisis in recruitment and retention”. She also said Gillian Keegan, the education secretary, had not negotiated with the NEU since Easter. The other unions which, like the NEU, are balloting members on strike action in the autumn are the National Association of Head Teachers, NASUWT and the Association of School and College Leaders. It is a year to the day since Boris Johnson announced that he would be resigning as prime minister. According to new polling by YouGov for the Times, only 26% of people think Rishi Sunak is better than Johnson as PM. Twenty-one percent think he is worse, and the rest either don’t know (12%) or think they are about the same (42%). Worryingly for Sunak, it is people who voted Conservative in 2019 and people who voted leave who seem to have the lowest regard for him. Labour and Liberal Democrat supporters are much more likely to say he is better than Johnson than to say he is worse than Johnson (although a large proportion of both groups think the two Tory leaders are much the same). But 35% of those who voted Conservative in 2019 think Sunak is worse than Johnson; only 23% think he is better. For leave voters, the figures are almost the same. Again, 35% of them think Sunak is worse, and only 19% say he is better. The poll also suggests that, while 68% of people do not think Johnson should try to return to parliament, 59% think he will attempt a comeback. Q: John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, says you are drunk on power, and excluding people with alternative views. Starmer does not accept that. Ferrari mentions various figures who have been suspended. Starmer says there are different issues involved in those cases. He says, within the party, there are arguments the whole time. They then take a collective view. But he has changed Labour, he says. He says he has turned it “inside out”, so that it is facing the electorate. And that’s it. The phone-in is over. Q: Do you think banks should close people’s accounts because of their views? No, says Starmer. But he says he does not believe that this is happening as much as some reports suggest. Q: Do you think the Bank of England has failed to control inflation? Starmer says he is not going to criticise the Bank. He says the Liz Truss mini-budget was more to blame. Q: You have watered down your promise to spend £28bn a year on a green investment fund? Starmer does not accept that. They would work up to spending that amount in the second or third year of a Labour government, not spending that amount straight away. But, he says, he had to adapt the plans because the cost of government borrowing has gone up so sharply. Q: My fear is that sewage in water could lead to a typhoid problem? Ferrari asks if Labour favours water nationalisation. Starmer says he does not back that. But he says he wants more accountability in the water industry. Water bosses should be personally liable, whether that is criminally or civilly, he says. And he says the government should consider withdrawing licences from water companies. Q: Why not common ownership for water? You backed this when you were running for Labour leader. Is this another flip flop? No, says Starmer. He says he is practical. In some areas, he backs common ownership. But he has looked at it, and in water it would just mean paying a huge sum of money to shareholders. Asked about Labour’s plans for more creative learning at schools, Starmer says he studied music at school and knows how valuable it is. Ferrari plays a clip from Andrew Lloyd Webber talking about how music teaches skills like working as part of a team. Starmer says he completely agrees. He says the earnings of parents are still more likely to determine how children end up than their talent. He wants to change that, he says. Q: Do you support a 6.5% pay rise recommendation for teachers? Starmer says we have not seen the actual recommendation. He says the government should publish that. But he says he cannot commit to accepting that now. Q: So you would honour it? Starmer says he would look at it. He cannot say now what a Labour government would do in a year or two. But these issues only get resolved by negotiation, he says. He says that is why he would order his education secretary to keep negotiating. Starmer says the Rwanda policy is the wrong policy. The next caller asks if Starmer backs Tony Blair’s suggestion that there should be further co-payment in the NHS. Starmer says he feels very strongly about this. He is committed to the NHS being free at the point of use. Q: Tony Blair said brave political leadership was needed to save the NHS. Starmer says he thinks Blair’s comments have been misunderstood. Starmer is now being asked about his talks with Sue Gray. He says he spoke to Sue Gray in October last year. In that call, he asked her, if she were to leave the civil service, would she be interested in working for him. It was a brief conversation, he says. He says they left it at that. The only other conversation came when the news that she might join Labour was leaked. At that point he called her to check she was OK, he says. That was just before she resigned, he says. He says he was not able to talk about this in detail previously because he was asked by the advisory committee on business appointments not to discuss this. UPDATE: Starmer said: Now I can give the full readout. It was a short call. It was towards the end of October and I phoned Sue — I’ve known her for a number of years, she is a phenomenal woman. I was looking for a chief-of-staff and the conversation I had with her, which was a short conversation, which is, ‘I’m looking for a chief-of-staff, if you were to leave the civil service, is this something you might consider?’. Because I knew the rules, she knew the rules. And we left it at that. I then didn’t speak to hear again, that was the extent of it. The only caveat is, when the leak came and she decided she would stand down, just before she stood down, I gave her a call to make sure she was alright and to find out what she was doing. But that was the long and the short of it and that is why I’ve always been confident in saying there was no breach of the code. I didn’t discuss politics, I didn’t discuss policy. I simply said, if you are to stand down at some point, would you be interested in being my chief-of-staff. Starmer says Labour would make more money available to help London alleviate the impact of the Ulez extension on drivers. Q: So why can’t Sadiq Khan delay it until that help is available? Starmer says Khan is under a legal obligation. He is facing legal action over going ahead with it, but he would face legal action if he did not, he says. The first caller asks about the extension of Ulez. He says it will decimate people’s lives. Sadiq Khan is “chilling” London, he says. He says he won’t vote Labour because of the policy, and he suggests the Ulez extension policy will cost Labour the election. Starmer says he recognises how difficult this will be. “This is a lot of money,” he says. He says the mayor has a legal obligation to do something about air pollution. And the first Ulez was introduced by Boris Johnson, a Tory mayor, he says. He says the question is, what can government do to help people. There is a scrappage scheme – but it is only worth £2,000. Starmer says other cities have had money from central government to help with clean air initiatives. But London has not had help. Q: Do you support the roll-out of Ulez? Starmer says he understands the difficulty it is calling … Q: But do you support it? Starmer says he does not think there is an alternative. He has looked at the law. Q: Why can’t the mayor delay it? Starmer says he knows that Sadiq Khan does listen to people. UPDATE: Starmer said: I accept that the mayor has no choice but to go ahead because of the legal obligation on him … I think Danny [Beales, Labour’s candidate in the Uxbridge and South Ruislip by-election] is right to stick up for his constituents. I understand the pain it is going to inflict … My experience of the mayor is he always listens to these overtures and that is why he has asked for more money on scrappage. I’ve looked at it myself, looked at the legal provision. I think it is difficult to say you could simply ignore the legal requirement to do something about this so the mayor in fairness is between a rock and a hard place on this. Keir Starmer is holding his LBC phone-in. Nick Ferrari is presenting. He asks Starmer about his Jonny Bairstow moment yesterday – when his speech got disrupted by protesters. Q: Did you speak to them afterwards? No, says Starmer. He said he had to leave for another engagement. Good morning. Teachers in England are on strike again today and Keir Starmer will shortly be holding his regular LBC phone-in where he is bound to be asked what Labour would do to end the dispute. In his Q&amp;A with journalists yesterday, he had what sounded like a reasonably good answer – keep negotiating every day until there is a deal – but it was an answer that obscured how far he might go to actually get a deal. It has been reported that the pay review body will recommend a 6.5% pay rise for teachers for 2023-24. This morning Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union (NEU), told the Today programme that, if the government were to accept that, and if schools were to get the funding to pay that (without having to make cuts elsewhere), teachers would accept. But ministers have not committed to accepting this year’s recommendations from the public sector pay bodies, and this morning Robert Halfon, an education minister, confirmed this. He told Sky News that it was “impossible to say” at this point if the recommendation for teachers’ pay would be accepted. He said: The message from the government is that we have to be as fair as possible, given the very difficult economic circumstances — don’t forget we still have £2tn in debt partly caused because of the £400bn spent on Covid, we’ve got the billions of pounds that are being spent on helping people with the cost of living and reducing energy bills. We have to be as fair as possible to teachers and support staff, I completely get that. But we have to be fair to the taxpayer and make sure we bear down on inflation as well, as that is the biggest tax on the cost of living – that would effect everyone, teachers and support staff included. Pressed again on this point, he said: You are asking what is impossible to say at this point in time. The pay review bodies will publish, the government will make its decision in due course. Starmer is on LBC at 9am. Otherwise, it looks like it could be a quiet day politically – there is nothing much in the diary – but the God of News will doubtless provide us with something.

This is for people who want to message me directly. I find it very useful when people message to point out errors (even typos – no mistake is too small to correct). Often I find your questions very interesting too. I can’t promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either in the comments below the line, privately (if you leave an email address and that seems more appropriate), or in the main blog, if I think it is a topic of wide interest.\n",
      "politics\/2023\/jul\/03\/after-13-years-in-power-who-exactly-do-tory-mps-think-the-establishment-is They came not to bury Rishi, but to praise him. Of course they did. There’s been no end of Tories queueing up to profess their support for the prime minister in recent days, only to then point out where he was going badly wrong. They’ve even created their own death rattle. The sound of rats leaving a sinking ship. Lashing out even as they face extinction. On Monday, the newly minted New Conservatives group of 25 MPs elected since the Brexit referendum went public for the first time at an event taking place in the Unherd Club – the Westminster establishment location for anyone who wants to be considered anti-establishment. They claimed to be just like-minded MPs. Men and women merely interested in ensuring their own survival. Though that looks unlikely, given the talent on show. Rather, with the absurd John Hayes as their president, they were more likely expendable outriders for a Suella Braverman leadership bid after the next election. By which time many of the New Conservatives are likely to be far from parliament. Not that Suella cares about their survival. She is merely keen to undermine Rishi Sunak. Most of what we were to hear would have been Home Office policy were Braverman to have her way. Danny Kruger got things under way by saying sorry. He wanted to pass on Lee Anderson’s sincere apologies for not being able to host the event. Lee had recently been told that he wasn’t feeling very well – up until about two hours earlier he had been just fine – and so was staying in bed. Any suggestion he had been leant on to not turn up was completely untrue. The Tory party would have been totally relaxed about its deputy chair slagging off current government policy. “We want to take back control from the establishment,” the Oxford-educated Kruger declared. The levels of denial were terrifying. He genuinely has no idea that he and the Tories are the establishment. That they have been running the country for the past 13 years. It’s as though he believes the government has been under the control of some unspecified blob. The lengths he will go to absolve himself of any responsibility. Having made the introductory speech, he went on to introduce the person who would be introducing the main speaker. Step forward the formidably dim Miriam Cates. Fresh from her Today programme car wreck that morning in which she didn’t seem to know that social care workers were not part of the NHS nor have any clue how much she thought they ought to be earning. And she is meant to be the brains of the operation. But hey ho. Cates is the woman many Tories see as the future of the party. Which may just be an indication that most Conservatives see their own extinction as inevitable. Someone you could almost guarantee to reach the wrong conclusion on almost everything. She, too, wanted to take back control. The Tories had made a promise to keep migration to 229,000 and now it was three times that. And the New Conservatives had a cunning plan to reverse that. Just stop foreigners coming in. Say no to Johnny Foreigner. It was time to make our borders “culturally secure”. We had to end our addiction to cheap labour and get Britons to fill all the vacancies in social care and the NHS. And we should just pay them more. She didn’t seem to have heard of the doctors and nurses going on strike. Her own government’s inflation targets. Or that most Britons didn’t want to do these jobs at any price the government was willing to pay. Her ignorance was total. It would have been shameless, were she on nodding terms with any concept of shame. Still, any Tory fringe event always has an element of comedy, and Cates was happy to oblige. Nor would she be the last laugh on offer. Next up was Tom Hunt, the Tory MP who had come up with the new immigration plan. He tried to be reasonable. First, he wanted to dispel the notion that he was a Tory rebel. He wasn’t. He adored Rish! more than life itself. It wasn’t that his plan was a criticism of the government’s policy. Rather, the government had just got a bit confused and he wanted to help out. And do anything to try to protect his seat at the next election. Hell, if it meant doubling inflation, closing universities, bankrupting the health and social care sector and sparking a recession to get down the number of immigrants, then it was a price worth paying. Yet again it was the liberal elite who were holding us back, said Hunt. Who also went to Oxford. “I worked in a radish-sorting factory where I was the only Brit,” he claimed nostalgically. Man of the people. Shame he didn’t decide to make that holiday job a full-time career. “People shouldn’t feel that any job is beneath them,” he added. Present company excepted. Last to speak was the permanently angry James Daly. He’s yet to find an issue on which he doesn’t want to pick a fight. It was all the Blob. The establishment. The Guardian. Another Tory MP who thinks Labour is in power. All he had ever wanted was to be helpful. And the best service he could offer Sunak right now was to spark another civil war. It’s what the party needed. He loved the Conservatives so much he’d do anything to make sure they were never elected again. The Q&amp;A that followed descended into chaos as everyone doubled down on their stupidity. It’s not often that Kruger finds himself the brightest person on a panel and he did his best to distance himself from his colleagues. He’d realised too late he was yet again on the wrong side of history. There was nothing to be gained by being the No Mark’s No Mark. Cates continued to increase wage inflation with every sentence. Any price was worth paying to get rid of foreigners. Hunt couldn’t quite work out why Labour was 20 points ahead in the polls when Sunak was doing such a great job. No one thought to enlighten him. Daly merely got angrier and angrier. Picking fights with Rish!, the media and himself. Eventually Kruger called time. It had all been much ado about nothing. The New Conservatives had no more clue than the Old Conservatives. All they had done was highlight yet more divisions within the Tory party. Rats in a sack. Fighting to the death. A theatre of the absurd for which the country is paying.\n",
      "politics\/live\/2023\/jul\/03\/rishi-sunak-new-conservatives-tory-suella-braverman-migration-nhs-latest-updates Peers have inflicted six defeats on the government over the illegal migration bill. In the most recent, they voted by 216 votes to 163 – a majority of 53 – in favour of an amendment that would ensure that, under the bill, the lawfulness of immigration detention is still covered by the common law. Other amendments have strenghthened protections for LGBT people (see 3.49pm), for children (see 4.01pm and 4.19pm) and for pregnant women (see 4.48pm). The debate is still going on and move votes are expected. Last week, on the first day of the bill’s report stage debate in the Lords, there were four government defeats. MPs have begun debating the economic activity of public bodies (overseas matters) bill, which is intended to stop councils operating anti-Israel boycott policies. But some Tories criticised the bill on the grounds that it would prevent councils expressing their disapproval of China. Opening the debate, Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, said: The bill before the house today does four things: it honours a manifesto promise that this government recommitted to in the last Queen’s Speech. It affirms the important principle that UK foreign policy is a matter for the UK government. It ensures that local authorities concentrate on serving their residents, not directing resources inefficiently. And critically, it provides protection for minority communities, especially the Jewish community, against campaigns that harm community cohesion and fuel antisemitism. In the 2019 manifesto, this government committed to, quotes, ban public bodies from imposing their own direct or indirect boycotts, disinvestment or sanctions campaigns against foreign countries. This legislation does just that. No more and no less. Rishi Sunak risks damaging “cultural security” and faces defeat at the next general election unless emergency measures to curb net migration are introduced, a new group of Conservative MPs has warned. Sue Gray was found to have apparently breached the civil service code by discussing a role with Keir Starmer without telling her Whitehall bosses, a Cabinet Office investigation has found. Rishi Sunak is facing transparency questions over private jet travel and thousands of pounds in Conservative party donations after they were recorded as coming from a small company linked to a multimillionaire businessman. Rishi Sunak has weighed into the row over Jonny Bairstow’s controversial dismissal at Lord’s on Sunday, saying Australia did not act in the spirit of the game. Crossings have set a new record for the month of June, pushing the total for the year so far to more than 11,000, PA Media reports. PA says: In the first six months of 2023, 11,434 people were detected making the journey from France, according to provisional government figures. This includes 155 migrants arriving in three boats on Friday, taking the total for June alone to 3,824. This is the highest total for the month of June since records began five years ago, PA news agency analysis of the Home Office data shows. The figures come almost six months after Rishi Sunak vowed to “stop the boats” and made this one of his five flagship pledges as prime minister. In June last year, 3,140 migrants arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel. In 2021 it was 2,177; 727 in 2020, 163 in 2019 and just four people in June 2018. Despite a flurry of crossings last month – including the highest daily total to date for the year on June 11 when 549 people were recorded making the journey – the total for the first half of 2023 is still 10% lower than this time last year (12,747). Commenting on the figures, Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said: Last month Rishi Sunak claimed crossings were down 20% because his plan was ‘starting to work’, while the home secretary claimed boats would stop from March. However, today’s figures show that crossings last month were the highest since records began. Time and again the prime minister chases short-term headlines instead of doing the hard work needed to tackle the problem. The numbers of dangerous crossings are rising again, hotel costs are spiralling, all while the government’s flagship Rwanda policy unravels in front of their eyes. Rishi Sunak, has called on the Israeli military to “exercise restraint” as a major aerial and ground offensive into the West Bank city of Jenin continues. At the afternoon lobby briefing, a No 10 spokesperson said: While we support Israel’s right to self-defence, the protection of civilians must be prioritised. In any military operation, we would urge the IDF [Israeli Defence Forces] to demonstrate restraint in its operations and for all parties to avoid further escalation in the West Bank and Gaza. There has been a fifth division in the Lords on the illegal migration bill, and the fifth defeat this afternoon. By 226 votes to 152, a majority of 74, peers voted for an amendment to keep the current rules saying that pregnant women can normally only be kept for 72 hours in immigration detention. The bill as drafted would have relaxed this condition. This time six Tories voted against the government: Lord Cormack, Lady Fall, Lady Helic, Lady Mobarik, Lady Sugg and Lady Wyld. Although the government has been losing votes on the illegal migration bill by hefty margins in the Lords this afternoon, there are not many Conservative peers rebelling. In the first two divisions (see 3.49pm), there were no Tories voting against the government. In the third, just two Conservatives (Lady Sugg, a former aide to David Cameron, and Lady Helic, a former adviser to William Hague), voted with Lady Mobarik for her amendment on unaccompanied children. (See 4.01pm.) In the vote on her next amendment, on children generally, Lord Cormack was the only Tory backing her. (See 4.19pm.) Peers are now voting on an amendment that would stop the bill weakening the rules that limit the detention of pregnant women. A few minutes later there was a marginally bigger defeat in the Lords on a second amendment relating to children. Like the previous one (see 4.01pm), it was tabled by Lady Mobarik, a Tory peer. This one would retain the existing rules that stop children being detained for more than 72 hours, or for more than a week with ministerial approval. The bill as drafted by the government would remove that limit. The amendment was passed by 230 votes to 151 – a majority of 79. In a third defeat, peers voted by 230 votes to 152 – a majority of 78 – in favour of an amendment to the illegal migration bill that retains the current rules that prevent unaccompanied children being detained for more than 24 hours. The bill as drafted by the government would remove that limit. Of the seven government defeats on this bill so far, this is the biggest. On Wednesday last week the government was defeated in four votes in the House of Lords on the illegal migration bill. The fifth vote was delayed because of a problem with the machines that read cards as peers vote, and instead it took place at the start of today’s debate (the second day of the bill’s report stage). The government was defeated again. By 204 votes to 168 – a majority of 36 – they voted for an amendment from the Liberal Democrats saying that, if someone is not removed within six months of their application being deemed inadmissable, the home secretary must consider their claim. A few minutes later ministers lost a second time when peers voted by 216 votes to 147 – a majority of 69 – in favour of a crossbench amendment that would prevent LGBT people being deported to a country where they would have a well-founded fear of persecution, or that would be otherwise inappropriate. Suella Braverman, the home secretary, signalled her support for the aims of the new Tory anti-immigration group, the New Conservatives, during Home Office questions in the Commons. The government has rejected some of the group’s specific policy recommendations. (See 1.46pm.) But when James Daly, a supporter of the New Conservatives, asked Braverman if she would raise the minimum salary threshold for skilled worker visas, Braverman said getting net migration down was the right priority. She told Daly: We always keep the salary threshold under review. But, as I said, net migration is too high and we need to get overall numbers down. How do we do that? Employers need to recruit more people already here rather than advertise abroad so much. We also need to get more people off welfare and back into economic activity and our welfare reforms will help that objective. And we cannot ignore the pressures that record levels of people coming to the UK put on housing supply, public services and on community relations. That’s why we need to focus on lowering net migration. We expect net migration to return to sustainable levels over time and immigration policy is under constant review. Ofcom has launched investigations into GB News and TalkTV as the media regulator struggles to handle how rightwing television channels are employing serving politicians as presenters, Jim Waterson reports. The New Conservatives’ website has now gone live. It says that the co-chairs are Miriam Cates and Danny Kruger, and that its president is Sir John Hayes, the Suella Braverman ally who also chairs the Common Sense Group. Cates, Kruger and Hayes all spoke at the National Conservatism conference that took place in London in May. Organised by a US thinktank, it showcased a brand of “faith, flag and family” conservatism that until recently was relatively rare in mainstream Conservative party politics. The three MPs have all been at the forefront of “culture war” campaigning and this may turn out to be a priority for the group. As the Sun’s Jack Elsom reports, Lee Anderson is not included in the list of MPs backing the new organisation. Elsom says Anderson is a supporter, but that he cannot officially endorse the group because of his role as the Conservative party deputy chair. Most of the Tories supporting the group are from “red wall” constituencies, seats won from Labour in the 2019 near-landslide election. Cates is in this category because she won Penistone and Stocksbridge in South Yorkshire. But Kruger represents Devizes, a safe Tory seat in Wiltshire, and Hayes has been the MP for South Holland and the Deepings in Lincolnshire since 1997. At the Downing Street lobby briefing No 10 confirmed that it is not in favour of the proposal from the New Conservatives group for a ban on foreign carers getting work visas. (See 10.10am and 10.34am.) Asked about the proposal, the PM’s spokesperson said: That’s not an approach we’re considering currently … We know there is significant demand in the care sector for staff. We are boosting domestic staff and backing that with hundreds of millions of pounds in support … right now we think we’re striking the right balance. The spokesperson also said he was not aware of any government plans to change the rules that let foreign graduates stay in the UK for up to two years without a job offer, which is another proposal from the New Conservatives. In implied criticism of the idea, he said: “I think people would recognise that highly trained students with the skills the UK wants and needs are people we should welcome.” But the spokesperson did not rule out the governmment imposing an annual cap of 20,000 on the number of refugees admitted to the UK. The government has said there should be an annual cap, and the New Conservatives propose it should be set at 20,000. (See 10.10am.) The spokesperson said the government wanted the Commons to be consulted on this. He said: It’s for parliament to make a judgment based on the current circumstances, which will, of course, vary. Downing Street has said the government supports the recommendations from the Competition and Markets Authority report calling for a body to monitor petrol and diesel prices. The CMA says consumers are paying more because of weakened competition. Asked about the report, the PM’s spokesperson told journalists at the No 10 lobby briefing: We support all of the findings from the CMA report. It isn’t right that at a time when people are struggling with rising living costs, drivers aren’t receiving a fair deal for fuel and instead being overcharged by retailers. That’s why we will be setting up a new scheme to enable motorists to conveniently find the best fuel prices in real time and easily identify who is charging fair prices and passing on savings and who is not. We will change the law to force retailers to provide up-to-date price information, increasing transparency and competition, and in turn driving down prices and easing people’s cost of living. New powers will also be handed to a public organisation, yet to be decided, to closely monitor the UK road fuel market, scrutinise prices and alert government if further intervention is needed in the market. We will consult on this in the autumn and while that takes place the CMA will create a voluntary scheme encouraging fuel retailers to share accurate up-to-date road fuel prices for August and continue to monitor fuel prices using its existing powers. Rishi Sunak has accused Australia of breaking the spirit of cricket over the controversial dismissal of Jonny Bairstow at Lord’s, PA Media reports. PA says: England’s Bairstow was stumped in bizarre circumstances on a tense final day in the second Test, with Australia wicketkeeper Alex Carey throwing down the stumps after the batter ducked the final ball of the over and set off to talk to partner Ben Stokes in the apparent belief the over had ended. At the morning lobby briefing, the prime minister’s spokesperson said Sunak, a keen cricket fan, agreed with the views of England captain Stokes about the incident. The spokesperson told reporters: “The prime minister agrees with Ben Stokes. He said he simply wouldn’t want to win a game in the manner Australia did. “The game did provide an opportunity to see Ben Stokes at his best and it was an incredible test match and he has confidence England will bounce back at Headingley.” Asked whether Sunak believed Australia’s actions were not in keeping with the spirit of cricket, his spokesperson said: “Yes.” Lee Anderson, the Conservative party deputy chairman, is never normally shy when it comes to telling the world what he thinks. He was meant to be fronting the press conference for New Conservatives, the “red wall” Tory group publishing a plan to slash net migration numbers before the general election. (See 10.10am.) The Sun’s Harry Cole says Anderson is said to be unwell. But he says Anderson’s illness is also convenient for those at party HQ who think the deputy chairman shouldn’t taking pot shots at the government’s immigration record. Ciaran Martin, a professor at Oxford University’s Blavatnick School of Government, and before that a very senior civil servant (he ran the National Cyber Security Centre), has also criticised the Cabinet Office’s decision to release a statement this morning accusing Sue Gray of a “prima facie” breach of the civil service code. (See 10.59am.) Martin says that the statement is “very silly” and that the case against Gray hasn’t been proved. Martin also says this sets an undesirable precedent for the future. The Competition and Markets Authority has proposed the launch of a fuel price monitor after it found that drivers were paying more for petrol and diesel than before the Covid pandemic because of “weakened” competition between retailers. Alex Lawson has the story here. At 3.30pm the Lib Dem MP Tim Farron is asking an urgent question about petrol prices. A Treasury minister will respond. Sir Jonathan Jones, the former head of the government legal service, says the use of the term “prima facie” in the Cabinet Office statement about Sue Gray (see 10.59am) shows that it has not been proved that she broke the civil service code. Posting on Twitter (he is one of the people not yet deterred, despite Elon Musk’s attempts to make the site less useable), Jones also says the Cabinet Office statement seems to have been motivated by “personal animus”. Labour has described the Cabinet Office statement saying Sue Gray committed a “prima facie” breach of the civil service code when she took a job with the party (see 10.59am) as “a political stunt”. As Rowena Mason reports, a Labour spokesperson said: All rules were complied with. The Acoba process makes that clear. This statement is a political stunt by a Tory government out of ideas and out of road. It says everything you need to know about the Tories that they have spent weeks wasting time on this Mickey Mouse nonsense, while refusing to investigate the serious allegations against their London mayoral hopeful, Daniel Korski. We’re looking forward to Sue Gray joining us this September as we continue to show the country that only Labour can build a better Britain. The Cabinet Office has published a statement today saying there was a “prima facie” breach of the civil service code when Sue Gray started talking to Keir Starmer about the possibility of a job as his chief of staff. At the end of last week Gray was cleared by the advisory committee on business appointments (Acoba) to start work with Labour in September, six months after she left her post as a second permanent secretary in the civil service. In a written ministerial statement published this morning, Jeremy Quin, the Cabinet Office minister, implies that Gray broke civil service rules because she did not tell her bosses about the job offer from Labour. Quin said: Ms Gray first spoke to the leader of the opposition in late October. This was approximately four months before she resigned from the Civil Service. The letter from Acoba also states that “... she had subsequent brief informal conversations … where she was updated on their developing plans …”. She did not inform ministers or the civil service of these interactions at any point prior to her resignation. It is right that we maintain the principle of confidentiality with respect to individual personnel matters. However, I am sure the house will agree with me that the facts in this case, when compared to the rules and guidance in place for civil servants, speak for themselves, and that there is a public interest in ensuring that the civil service code is adhered to. Given the exceptional nature of this case and the previous commitment by ministers to update the house, I can now confirm that the Cabinet Office process looking into the circumstances leading up to Ms Gray’s resignation has been concluded. As part of the process, Ms Gray was given the opportunity to make representations but chose not to do so. This process, led by the civil service, found that the civil service code was prima facie broken as a result of the undeclared contact between Ms Gray and the leader of the opposition. Quin said it was “deeply unfortunate” that this happened, but that he retained confidence in the impartiality of the civil service. “Prima facie” means at first sight and Quin’s use of the term in his statement is ambiguous, perhaps intentionally. In vernacular English it is often used to mean “clear cut”, and so it sounds as if this is particularly serious. But lawyers take it to mean “superficial”, as opposed to “on the basis of the actual evidence”, and Quin may have been acknowledging that, with Gray having not given the Cabinet Office her side of the story, the matter was never fully resolved. In most workplaces an informal job offer from a rival organisation is not something people are routinely expected to disclose. The Conservative MP Miriam Cates is a member of the New Conservatives group and she was on the Today programme this morning defending its plans for immigration, and in particular the proposal to stop foreign care workers getting work visas. When it was put to her that the care industry could not function without foreign workers, Cates said there were 5 million “economically inactive” people in the country and that, instead of hiring cheap labour from abroad, employers should be paying more so that Britons took the jobs instead. When it was put to her that Britons aren’t applying for these jobs, Cates replied: Well they’re not going to work in care until we make the pay and conditions good enough, and the only way we’re going to do that is to cut off the supply of cheap labour from abroad … Let me use the analogy of during the pandemic when we had an HGV driver shortage and lots of people called then to say we must issue more visas to abroad to get more drivers. But we didn’t, we made supply side reform and guess what? Haulage firms put up their wages, they attracted more workers and solved the problem without issuing visas to abroad. That’s exactly the same economic and market principle that we need to apply. When asked how much firms should be paying their care workers, Cates said she did not have an answer to that. Kevin Schofield, at Huffington Post, has a full write-up of the interview. The government has repeatedly said it wants to reduce the dependence of employers on foreign workers, but even after Brexit there has been relatively little progress on this front. Keir Starmer has also said that he wants to “help the British economy off its immigration dependency”, although, unlike the New Conservatives, Labour is not calling for big cuts in net migration numbers in the short term. The New Conservatives, the group of “red wall” Tories calling for tighter controls on immigration, have published policy document giving details of their plan. Unusually, it’s a 12-point one, not a 10-point one. It does not seem to be available online yet, so here it is. 1) Close the temporary schemes that grant eligibility for worker visas to ‘care workers’ and ‘senior care workers’. This policy will reduce visas granted by 117,000 between those workers and their dependents, leading to a reduction in ‘long-term inward migration’ of 82,000. 2) Raise the main skilled work visa salary threshold to £38,000 per annum. This could reduce LTIM [long-term immigration] by 54,000 migrants per year. 3) Extend the closure of the student dependent route, which allows full access to the job market and is not subject to skill or salary thresholds, to students enrolled on one-year research master’s degrees. Combined with the government’s existing proposal, this could lead to a reduction in LTIM of around 75,000. 4) Close the graduate route to students, so as to stop students staying in the UK after graduating for up to two years without a job offer. This should lead to a reduction of around 50,000 in LTIM per year. 5) Reserve university study visas for the brightest international students by excluding the poorest-performing universities from eligibility criteria. This could lead to a reduction of 49,000 from LTIM. 6) Continue to monitor the reduction in visa applications under the humanitarian schemes and introduce caps on future humanitarian schemes should the predicted 168,000 reductions not be realised. 7) Rapidly pass and implement the provisions of the illegal migration bill, leading to a reduction of at least 35,000 from LTIM. 8) Cap the number of refugees legally accepted for resettlement in the UK at 20,000. 9) Raise the minimum combined income threshold to £26,200 for sponsoring a spouse and raise the minimum language requirement to B1 (intermediate level). This should lead to an estimated 20,000 reduction in LTIM. 10) Make the migration advisory committee report on the effect of migration on housing and public services, not just the jobs market, by treating future demand on a par with labour requirements in all studies. 11) Cap the amount of social housing that councils can give to non-UK nationals at five percent until the number of British families waiting for housing clears. 12) Raise the immigration health surcharge to £2,700 per person, per year. Some of these ideas are similar to ideas that Suella Braverman, the home secretary, has been arguing for within government. And some would just build on initiatives the government is already taking. For example, the illegal migration bill says there should be a cap on the number of refugees admitted to the UK every year. The New Conservatives say the cap should be set at 20,000. According to the Home Office, the UK offered protection to 23,841 people coming to the country in 2022. Good morning. According to the main political write-through in the Sunday Times yesterday, Rishi Sunak feels life isn’t treating him fairly. Tim Shipman and Tom Calver wrote: At Winchester, Oxford, Stanford, Goldman Sachs and McKinsey, Sunak was told that if he worked hard and solved problems, he would succeed in life. But political reward is more hard won. One cabinet minister put it this way: “In his mind the deal he struck with the universe is not working out. He’s very clever, but he knows that with cleverness comes responsibility to graft ... But if you work hard and do the right thing, the universe will reward you — and in his mind at the moment the universe is not keeping its side of the bargain.” Shipman and Calver aren’t saying that Sunak himself has been moaning about cosmic forces conspiring against him; they are just quoting someone trying to sum up his state of mind. But if Sunak does privately believe that the universe has lined up with Boris Johnson in a conspiracy to do him in, then he will find two pieces of fresh evidence for that in the news this morning, both relating to immigration. First, a group called the New Conservatives, around 25 “red wall” Tory MPs, are publishing plans designed to get net migration down to below 226,000 by the time of the next election. As Rajeev Syal reports, their ideas go beyond what the government is already doing. And their headline goal, which revives the promise in the Conservatives’s 2019 manifesto, serves as a rebuke to Sunak, because it highlights his recent decision to in effect abandon that target (or redefine it, to be more precise, but in practice that amounts to the same thing). Second, the ConservativeHome website this morning has published a survey of Tory members suggesting that more than two thirds of them want the UK to leave the European convention on human rights. ConHome surveys are seen as a reliable guide to opinion in the party, and this creates another headache for Sunak. He has not ruled out leaving the convention. But unlike Suella Braverman, the home secretary, he has no enthusiasm for the proposition which, were it to be tried, might well split his party, and torpedo the UK’s reputation internationally. In his write-up of the survey, Paul Goodman, the ConservativeHome editor, said he thinks Sunak may be forced into promising a “changed relationship” with the European court of human rights in the next Tory manifesto. He says: I’ve suspected for some time that Rishi Sunak may be propelled into promising a changed relationship with the court during the run-up to the next election. But even if he doesn’t, the scale of refugee movement in a globalised world, let alone that of illegal immigration, is likely to move European centre-right parties in that direction during the years and decades ahead. Here is the agenda for the day. 10.30am: The high court resumes hearing the government’s legal challenge against the Covid inquiry’s demand to see unredacted WhatsApp messages from ministers. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 12.30pm: Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, holds a phone-in on LBC. 1pm: Lee Anderson, the Conservative party deputy chairman and a member of the New Conservatives, speaks at a press conference about the group’s call for tighter immigration controls. After 1pm (UK time): James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, addresses a meeting of the EU-UK parliamentary partnership assembly in Brussels. 2.30pm: Suella Braverman, the home secretary, takes questions in the Commons. After 3pm: Peers resume their report stage debate on the illegal migration bill. After 3.30pm: MPs debate the economic activity of public bodies (overseas matters) bill, which is intended to stop councils implementing boycotts of Israel. 4pm: Amanda Pritchard, the NHS England chief executive, gives evidence to the Commons public accounts committee. And at some point today the Cabinet Office will publish a written ministerial statement about Sue Gray with the title “Prima facie breach of the civil service code by the former second permanent secretary for the union and the constitution”.

      "politics\/2023\/jul\/03\/new-conservatives-immigration-questions-over-sunak-authority In normal times, you would not expect a deputy chair of your own party to help produce an independent policy programme for migration that is especially different from the government’s own. But for Rishi Sunak, these are not normal times. The presence of Lee Anderson among the New Conservatives, a pressure group of predominantly “red wall”-based 2019- and 2017-intake Tory MPs, is just one of the eyebrow-raising elements of their decision to intervene on migration. The group held a formal launch on Monday for its 12-point plan to cut immigration – policies which, if implemented, would have a fairly dramatic impact on not just immigration but the economy more widely. The stated ambition is to reduce annual net migration from 2022’s 606,000 to 240,000 in 2024, involving significant cuts to visas for care staff, further curbs on student visas, a big rise in the minimum salary threshold for skilled workers and a cap on refugee numbers. It was devised by a group including Anderson, the combative Ashfield MP who Sunak made Tory deputy chair in February. The emergence of the plan raises a series of interlinked questions, including what it says about the renewed salience of immigration as a political issue, and the authority of Sunak – plus of course whether the proposals are even realistic. The return of migration as a concern for restive backbenchers marks a change from the immediate post-Brexit period, when the proportion of voters who named it as among their most pressing issues dropped as low as 15%. This is now back up to 35%, rising to nearly 60% among Tory voters, caused by both the increase in net migration, and people including Nigel Farage prompting a political panic about refugees making Channel crossings. Grumbles about immigration are not exactly a new thing for Tory prime ministers, but the emergence of such a concerted and notably detailed parallel policy will be seen as another sign that while Sunak is not at risk of an open challenge by his party, neither is he really in charge of it. Perhaps most worrying for Sunak is the fact that among the MPs at the policy’s launch was John Hayes, a veteran rightwing backbencher who is particularly close to Suella Braverman – indicating that the home secretary, not averse to a bit of policy freelancing herself, may well be sympathetic. More widely, with the Conservatives consistently 20 or more percentage points behind Labour in opinion polls, it is perhaps of little surprise that some of Sunak’s MPs – notably those in vulnerable red wall seats – want drastic action. In pure party management terms this is unlikely to trouble Sunak in the Commons. But functional political parties do not generally propose two simultaneous immigration policies. The New Conservatives argue that theirs is not a policy change, just a restatement of the Tories’ 2019 manifesto pledge to reduce net migration, which at the time was only a bit above 200,000. It is nonetheless fair to say that plenty of other Conservative MPs would worry about the wisdom of trying to implement such massive reductions so fast, especially in a care sector already struggling to fill vacancies. Asked about the practicalities of the plan, Miriam Cates, the MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, another leading figure in the New Conservatives, told BBC Radio 4 that ministers should “make care work an attractive career for British people” and invest more in skills, infrastructure and productivity. That is not a new argument – in fact it is one already made in very similar terms by Labour. Nevertheless, it is usually phrased as a long-term aspiration, not something to be done in little more than a year. It was notable that when Cates was asked what sort of hourly rate might be needed to attract UK nationals to care work, she replied: “I don’t know.” With such basic questions unanswered, it is probably fair to say that the New Conservatives will not get their way on immigration policy. But for an increasingly beleaguered Sunak, it is yet another split he could really do without.\n",
      "politics\/live\/2023\/jun\/29\/partygate-privileges-committee-boris-johnson-jacob-rees-mogg-nicola-sturgeon-covid-inquiry-uk-politics-live Court of appeal judges have ruled that it is unlawful to send asylum seekers to Rwanda to have their claims processed, in a judgment that delivers a potential hammer blow to government policy. Former cabinet ministers and allies of Boris Johnson have been accused of launching an “unprecedented and coordinated” campaign to undermine the inquiry into whether he misled parliament over Partygate. There was “no set plan” in Scotland for dealing with a pandemic of the nature of Covid-19, Nicola Sturgeon has told the UK Covid inquiry. The Scottish government has ditched controversial marine protection plans after a furious backlash that united coastal communities, grassroots campaigners and sectors of the fishing industry. Plans to build a national memorial to the Holocaust have moved “one step closer”, Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, said today. Speaking after MPs approved the Holocaust memorial bill yesterday, Gove said: We are privileged in this country to have survivors of the Holocaust who have been willing to share their testimony. Sadly, this living testimony will not be with us forever. The government is absolutely determined to complete the Holocaust memorial at the very heart of our national life to preserve the memory of what happened for ourselves and for all future generations. MPs from all sides of the house have expressed their support to get the memorial built and I am pleased yesterday’s vote brings it a step closer. The memorial will be located in Victoria Tower Gardens, next to the Houses of Parliament. The bill will now be debated by a select committee. It has been classified as a “hybrid” bill, meaning bodies directly affected by it will be able to petition for parts of it to be changed. Nadine Dorries, the former culture secretary, has hit back at the Commons privileges committee over its report saying she and other Boris Johnson supporters sought to undermine its inquiry into the former PM. In an interview with TalkTV, where she presents a show, she said: First of all, they need to grow up and put on their big girl and boy pants and stop crying about hurty words. This is a democracy we live in where free speech reigns … In the words of Lord Cruddas, if they don’t want to be accused of being a kangaroo court, they should stop hopping so much. I find it absolutely bizarre that I would be accused of coordinating it. There was absolutely no coordination. I did put out a few tweets, and I have made a few comments but there is something much more substantial that’s going on here. I am not sure how interested the public are … but if they are I think they will see this for what it is, which is an attempt to close down critical comment or freedom of speech in the House of Commons which is the mother of all parliaments and our democracy. The Rwandan government is very supportive of its asylum deal with the UK, and defended it again in a statement this morning (See 10.44am.) But, as Ignatius Ssuuna reports from Kigali, that is not a universal view. Frank Habineza, an MP and opposition party leader, said there were not enough jobs for Rwandans, let alone refugees. He said: The UK government is violating the rights of asylum seekers by forcing them to come to Rwanda when they don’t want it. We don’t have employment opportunities here. What will the refugees do when they arrive here? Even nationals don’t have jobs. As green party, we oppose this policy and today’s ruling has vindicated us. The Braverman statement is now over. Sir Bill Cash rises to make a point of order, and asks for an assurance that, when MPs debate the illegal migration bill as it returns from the Lords, they won’t be banned from raising issues on sub judice grounds, because of the case going to the supreme court. Dame Eleanor Laing, the deputy speaker, tells him the sub judice rule does not apply to debates on legislation. Kerry McCarthy (Lab) asks what the government’s plan is if it cannot send asylum seekers to Rwanda. Braverman says the legal action is not over yet. So the question is premature, she says. McCarthy was raising a point highlighted earlier today by the Migration Observatory, a research organisation based at Oxford University. Peter Walsh, one of its senior researchers, said: The ruling on the legality of the Rwanda scheme has important ramifications for UK asylum policy and in particular the illegal migration bill. The bill currently going through parliament is predicated on the idea that the UK will remove asylum seekers to safe third countries. Even with a Rwanda deal in place, it has never been clear how easy this would be. If there are no safe third countries accepting the UK’s asylum seekers, the core idea behind the policy can’t be implemented. In essence, all the eggs are in one basket and this basket is looking fragile. Stella Creasy (Lab) says most of the people in the boats are Iranians and Afghans, and their asylum applications have a 98% success rate. She asks how much money has been allocated for this policy. Braverman says last year there were 12,000 Albanians arriving on small boats. She says the vast majority of people on the boats are young men, paying to come to the UK. That is not what humanitarian protection is all about, she says. Braverman says Labour does not have a plan to stop the boats. “What they are proposing is open borders and uncontrolled immigration,” she says. Danny Kruger (Con) asks if the government will seek further assurances from Rwanda about asylum seekers not being returned to countries where they will face prosecution, in the light of what the appeal court said about the risk of this happening. (See 3.25pm.) Braverman says Rwanda is a safe country. But she says the government is always willing to review its arrangements with the country. Matt Warman (Con) refers to the report of an asylum seeker being accused of raping a woman in a park just days after arriving, and says members of the public want to see the Rwanda policy implemented. In her opening statement Suella Braverman, the home secretary, said it was madness for governments in the west to be “lining the pockets of people-smugglers and turning our seas into graveyards, all in the name of a phoney humanitarianism”. Labour’s Oliver Blake put it to her that the term “phoney humanitarianism” was “deeply offensive”. Braverman said she favoured the UK offering refuge to people fleeing persecution. But she said she did not see why people should be coming to Britain from safe countries like France. Mark Francois (Con) says Suella Braverman’s instincts on this are right. (He seems to be talking about her opposition to the ECHR.) He says the government is right to appeal. But this will take months, he says. What can be done to speed this up? And wasn’t Sir Edward Leigh right to say the UK needs a derogation from the ECHR? Braverman says Francois speaks “very powerfully”. She says the court of appeal wants submissions on appeals by 6 July. She says the summary judgment acknowledges the need for speed. She does not address the question about a derogation from the ECHR. Sir Edward Leigh (Con) told MPs that the ruling showed why the UK should be able to derogate from the European convention on human rights. The SNP’s Patrick Grady told Suella Braverman that he thought she was secretly pleased with the ruling, because she actually wanted a fight with the judiciary. He said that her dream was not for flights to Rwanda to take off, but for them to be blocked so the government would have a reason to withdraw from the European court of human rights. Here is the quote from Lord Burnett, the lord chief justice, suggesting talk of Rwanda taking thousands of asylum seekers from the UK is “hyperbole”. It is from Burnett’s dissenting judgment (Burnett was the only one of the three judges hearing the case who thought Rwanda should count as a third country). In much of the political hyperbole which surrounded the announcement of the Rwanda policy there was talk of Rwanda, within a few years, being a destination for thousands of asylum seekers who arrived irregularly in the United Kingdom. The UNHCR evidence questions whether Rwanda can cope with the volumes apparently contemplated. Yet the evidence before the divisional court was that the physical capacity for housing asylum seekers in Rwanda was limited to 100; that of the 47 originally identified for removal the Home Office expected in fact to remove about 10; and that the starting point for any removal under the agreement was for the two governments to agree who would be sent to Rwanda. Braverman is replying to Cooper. She says today is a bad day for the British people, but a good day for people-smugglers and a good day for Labour. Cooper is pleased about the ruling, she claims. She claims the current system is “rigged against the British people”. And that suits Labour, she claims. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, is speaking now. She starts by saying the ruling shows the government’s policy is failing. (See 12.05am.) She asks Braverman if she agrees with the lord chief justice, who said in his judgment that the notion that thousands of asylum seekers would be sent to Rwanda was “hyperbole”. She also points out that the report about foreign national offenders today (see 3.53pm) amounted to a “damning indictment of the Tory Home Office”. Braverman says people are not naive. She goes on: While our compassion to help people may be infinite, the public understand that our capacity to do so is finite, and therefore precious. The British people will no longer indulge the polite fiction that we have a duty or infinite capacity to support everyone in the world who is fleeing persecution, nor anyone that would simply like to come here to improve their lot and succeeds in making it to our shores. She says the government is spending £6m a day on hotel accommodation for asylum seekers putting up people who have “broken into this country”. Carrying on like this would be “madness”, she says. That is why the government will do “whatever it takes to stop the boats”. Suella Braverman, the home secretary, is making her statement to MPs about the court of appeal ruling on the Rwanda policy. She says she visited Rwanda in March, and signed an update to the memorandum of understanding with the country to bring it in line with the illegal migration bill. Rwanda has the capacity to process thousands of asylum seekers, who will receive “excellent care” before they move on. She says a legal challenge halted the first flight to Rwanda. The high court said Rwanda was a safe country, she says. Today the court of appeal “unanimously found in the government’s favour” on most aspects of the appeal, she says. And it found that it was lawful for the government to relocate asylum seekers to a safe third county. But two of the three judges were concerned that there were deficiencies in Rwanda’s processes that meant there could be a breach of the European convention on human rights. She says the court did not say Rwanda itself was not safe. It said there was a risk that asylum countries in Rwanda might be sent back to countries where they would not be safe. This is a “disappointing judgment”, she says. The government will seek leave to appeal, she says. She says she hopes this will happen quickly. She goes on: This judgment is disappointing for the majority of the British people who have repeatedly voted for controlled immigration. Colin Yeo, an immigration lawyer, has posted a good thread on Twitter about the report about the removal of foreign national offenders published today. (See 3.53pm.) It starts here. He points out that it is surely no coincidence that the Home Office published the report on a day when home affairs specialists are otherwise engaged. The Home Office wants to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda, but currently is not allowed to because of the courts. It is, however, allowed to deport foreign national offenders (FNOs), foreign nationals who have committed offences in the UK. But a damning report out todays say some FNOs are not being deported promptly – not because the court of appeal has got in the way, but because of poor management. The report is from David Neal, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration. In a statement summarising his findings, he said: It is clear to me that the Home Office does not have a firm grip on its caseworking operations in FNORC [Foreign National Offenders Returns Command], and the shortcomings with data and MI [management information] add to this challenge. Staff throughout the command lacked a clear sense of priorities and I found a disproportionate focus on managing cases, rather than making decisions and progressing the removal of FNOs. If my assessment is correct, this inspection points towards broader concerns for the Home Office in anticipation of a likely increase in immigration detention, removals and caseworking as a consequence of the IMB [illegal migration bill]. The early removal scheme (ERS) is not working well. This means that FNOs who want to leave the country are not being removed quickly. This is largely down to delays in caseworking which add to the significant challenges and costs of detaining FNOs in the prison estate. I found that little, if any, progress had been made in this area since the National Audit Office made similar findings in 2014. And here is an extract from the report. My inspection found FNORC to be a large and complex operation which lacked the ability to track and monitor the progression of cases, from initial referral to decision outcome. Staff did not have a clear sense of priorities, and there was a disproportionate focus on managing cases, rather than making decisions and progressing the removal of FNOs. Of particular concern was the situation regarding data and management information, with staff working from unwieldy local spreadsheets rather than a reliable central database that meets the needs of the business area. This is something that the ICIBI [independent chief inspector of borders and immigration] has repeatedly encountered and commented on in previous reports. It is therefore unsurprising that the Home Office was unable to provide consistent data sets or complete evidence returns for this inspection. It is unacceptable that the department cannot produce clear and reliable data on the FNOs for whom it is responsible. To provide just one illustration of the shortcomings of the data being used to manage criminal casework, this inspection found that the only way for the Home Office to identify a nationality cohort awaiting deportation was to manually trawl through multiple spreadsheets. For an operation of this size to be run like this is unacceptable. For any operation to be effective, there needs to be a single version of the truth, and for FNOs it does not exist. Worryingly, I found no evidence of a strategy to build one. Moreover, there is insufficient information to effectively identify which FNOs could be removed from the country today. And this is from Haroon Siddique, with more detail about why the court of appeal ruled the Rwanda policy unlawful. Here is more from the court of appeal’s judgment on the Rwanda policy. This is from Sir Geoffrey Vos, master of the rolls, explaining in detail why he thought Rwanda’s record on dealing with asylum applications meant it should not be viewed as a safe country. Vos said: The UNHCR’s evidence shows 100% rejection rates at RSDC [Refugee Status Determination Committee] level for nationals of Afghanistan, Yemen and Syria, from which asylum seekers under the MEDP [Migration and Economic Development Partnership – the UK’s deal with Rwanda] may well emanate ... The overall rejection rate for the 156 cases covered by the figures is 77%. Of the 34 recent asylum seekers from a country with close bilateral relations with Rwanda, three were peremptorily rejected by the DGIE [Directorate General of Immigration and Emigration], three were forcibly expelled to the Tanzanian border, two were instructed to leave Rwanda within days, and two more were threatened with direct expulsion to their country of origin. In addition, there have been five recent cases of expulsion of those arriving at Kigali airport: two Libyans removed from Kigali airport in February 2021, two Afghans chain refouled to Afghanistan on 24 March 2022, and one Syrian chain refouled to Syria on 19 April 2022. The cases of airport refoulement do not themselves demonstrate that there would be a real risk of identical methods of refoulement under the MEDP, since those asylum seekers arriving in Rwanda would have been pre-approved by the government of Rwanda and would arrive on planned flights. These instances nonetheless illustrate, as described by Underhill LJ at [156], “a culture of, at best, insufficient appreciation by DGIE officials of Rwanda’s obligations under the refugee convention, and at worst a deliberate disregard for those obligations”. “Refoulement” means the forcible return of refugees to a country where they may suffer persecution. There was “no set plan” in Scotland for dealing with a pandemic of the nature of Covid-19, Nicola Sturgeon has told the UK Covid inquiry. Libby Brooks has the story here. The Commons privileges committee included Sir Michael Fabricant in its list of Tories who tried to undermine its inquiry because he posted a message on Twitter accusing it of malice. On the day Boris Johnson announced his resignation as an MP, Fabricant said: Serious questions will need to be asked about the manner in which the investigation was conducted. These were no jurists as was apparent by the tone of the examination. The question of calibre, malice and prejudice will need to be answered now or by historians. Today, in his response to the committee’s latest report accusing him and other Boris Johnson supporters of interfering with its work, he defended his comment – while also insisting that he did not condone threats directed at members of the committee. As the LBC’s Henry Riley points out, like many of the other Johnson loyalists criticised by the committee today, Fabricant featured in the former PM’s resignation honours. Suella Braverman, the home secretary, will be addressing MPs later about the appeal court ruling on the Rwanda policy. In a statement, she said she was disappointed by the decision, but that the court had accepted that relocating asylum seekers to a safe third country would be lawful. She said: The court of appeal have been clear that the policy of relocating asylum seekers to a safe third country for the processing of their claims is in line with the refugee convention. While we are disappointed with their ruling in relation to Rwanda’s asylum system, I will be seeking permission to appeal this. Keir Starmer has been campaigning in Selby and Ainsty in North Yorkshire today, ahead of the byelection there on 20 July, and highlighting Labour’s support for homeowners. After a meeting with a resident, Alice Fletcher, he told reporters: Nobody wants to build on our fantastic countryside, particularly in a place like this, but we do need a plan that allows families, young families in particular, to have a chance to get a home of their own. At the moment the government’s turned its back on homeowners, there is no plan, and there’ll be many, many more people like Alice who are trapped, unable to move forward with their lives. This byelection is so important in that respect because you’ve had 13 years of an MP who’s done next to nothing, I think mentioned buses in parliament three times, a really critical issue – and has now thrown his toys out of the pram because he didn’t get a peerage. That is disgraceful. There is no way that the Conservatives deserve to win this byelection. Starmer was referring to Nigel Adams, the Boris Johnson loyalist who resigned alongside Johnson. Adams had been expecting a peerage, but was one of the MPs on Johnson’s resignation honours list blocked from getting one, apparently because they had not committed to leaving the Commons promptly. In 2019 Adams had a majority of 20,137 over Labour. UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, has welcomed the court of appeal’s decision on the Rwanda policy. During the appeal it participated as an “intervener”, advising the court on international refugee law. It said: In our submissions to the court, UNHCR expressed its longstanding and well-known concerns about the “externalization” of asylum obligations. We continue to urge the government of the United Kingdom to instead pursue other measures, including cooperation with the UK’s European neighbours and fair and fast asylum procedures, that would be more humane, efficient, and cost-effective. Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, told MPs this morning that they would get a chance to debate the privileges committee’s report about interference with its Boris Johnson inquiry on Monday 10 July. She said the fact that a debate had been scheduled a debate showed “how seriously the government takes these matters of privilege”. At the Downing Street lobby briefing, the PM’s spokesperson was unable to say “this far in advance” whether Rishi Sunak would be attending the debate, or voting. Asked if the PM still had confidence in Zac Goldsmith, the only serving minister named in the report as one of those Tories who undermined the inquiry’s work, the spokesperson said he did. Asked if the PM was relaxed about what Lord Goldsmith had done, the spokesperson said Sunak had spoken publicly about how he supported and respected the work of the committee. In its report, the committee criticises Goldsmith for retweeting a tweet, on the day Boris Johnson announced his resignation as an MP, calling its inquiry into him a witch-hunt and a kangaroo court. Goldsmith also said: Exactly this. There was only ever going to be one outcome and the evidence was totally irrelevant to it. It is also worth highlighting the final paragraph of Rishi Sunak’s statement. (See 12.26pm.) The policy of this government is very simple: it is this country – and your government – who should decide who comes here, not criminal gangs. And I will do whatever is necessary to make that happen. There is a debate within the Conservative party over whether or not it should consider withdrawing from the European convention on human rights to enable the government to deport asylum seekers without risk of legal challenge. Suella Braverman, the home secretary, has called for this publicly in the past, and there is a smallish cohort of Tory backbenchers who strongly agree. Rishi Sunak has been more equivocal. In the past he has suggested there is no need for Britain to leave the convention, but he has not ruled out the idea, and the line in his statement today about being willing to do “whatever is necessary” to ensure the UK controls its borders will encourage those Conservatives who want him to move in this direction. Some in the party want to turn this into an issue at the next general election. Rishi Sunak has just issued a statement saying that he “fundamentally” disagrees with the court of appeal’s ruling on the Rwanda policy. He has confirmed that the government will appeal to the supreme court. Here is the statement in full. While I respect the court I fundamentally disagree with their conclusions. I strongly believe the Rwandan government has provided the assurances necessary to ensure there is no real risk that asylum seekers relocated under the Rwanda policy would be wrongly returned to third countries – something that the lord chief justice agrees with. Rwanda is a safe country. The high court agreed. The UNHCR have their own refugee scheme for Libyan refugees in Rwanda. We will now seek permission to appeal this decision to the supreme court. The policy of this government is very simple: it is this country – and your government – who should decide who comes here, not criminal gangs. And I will do whatever is necessary to make that happen. The Liberal Democrats are urging the government to “accept reality” and abandon its Rwanda policy. Alistair Carmichael, the party’s home affairs spokesperson, said: Not only is the Conservatives’ Rwanda asylum plan immoral, ineffective and incredibly costly for taxpayers, but the court of appeal has also now said it is unlawful, too. It will do nothing to stop dangerous Channel crossings – and it runs roughshod over the UK’s legal obligations, as the courts have confirmed. The home secretary needs to finally accept reality. Instead of wasting even more taxpayer money by defending this plan in the courts, the home secretary should scrap her vanity project and focus on tackling the asylum backlog created by her own government’s incompetence. Labour says the court of appeal ruling today shows the government’s policy on so-called small boats is “completely unravelling”. In a statement Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said: Today’s judgment shows that Rishi Sunak has no plan to fix the Tories’ small boats chaos and his only idea is completely unravelling. Ministers were forced to admit this week that it will cost £169,000 to send each person to Rwanda on top of the £140m of taxpayers’ money they have already spent. Now the court has found that ministers didn’t even do the basic work to make sure the scheme was legal or safe. Time and again, ministers have gone for gimmicks instead of getting a grip, and slogans instead of solutions, while the Tory boats chaos has got worse. The Rwanda scheme is unworkable, unethical and extortionate, a costly and damaging distraction from the urgent action the government should be taking. They should now put that money into Labour’s plan to go after the criminal gangs, clear the asylum backlog and stop dangerous boat crossings that are undermining our border security and putting lives at risk. Cooper will be facing Suella Braverman, the home secretary, in the Commons later when Braverman makes a statement on the court of appeal ruling. It is now expected around 3.30pm. Labour is challenging Rishi Sunak to condemn the Tory MPs and peers criticised in today’s privileges committee report. (See 9.19am.) In a statement on it, Thangam Debbonaire, the shadow leader of the Commons, accused him of allowing them “to undermine and attack Britain’s democratic institutions”. She said: Rishi Sunak has allowed senior members of his own party to undermine and attack Britain’s democratic institutions. This includes a serving government minister and two former cabinet ministers. It’s yet another example of the prime minister’s weakness and failure to hold his own ministers to high standards that Zac Goldsmith is still a government minister. It’s time Rishi Sunak condemned his Conservative colleagues who have sought to override parliament’s standards system to get one of their own off the hook. He must accept the committee’s damming conclusions and make time for MPs to approve the report in full. A reader asks: As to Lord Cruddas’s claim [see 8.56am] – is it possible for someone who is not an MP to be found in contempt of parliament or not? Yes, they can be. Dominic Cummings was found to be in contempt of parliament, as were two News of the World executives. But the Commons does not have sanctions it can impose on non-MPs for contempt of parliament, and so it all can do is censure them. In the past it could fine or imprison people for contempt of parliament, but it’s now widely accepted that these powers have lapsed. The court of appeal judgment has been welcomed by campaigners and charities who work with asylum seekers. Here are some of the their comments. From Alison Pickup, director of Asylum Aid (which was one of the parties involved in the appeal): We are delighted that the court of appeal has upheld the argument that Rwanda is not a safe country for asylum seekers. While we are disappointed that the court has held that the process can be made fair, we are pleased that it has not upheld the high court’s judgment and has made it clear that the government needs to ensure that Home Office officials give people more time when they need it. From Detention Action (which was involved in the original high court case, but not the appeal): We are relieved that the UK’s court of appeal has recognised the unlawfulness of this government’s controversial and dangerous deal with the Rwandan regime … The intervention of the court proves that in the UK we still recognise our responsibility to protect people seeking asylum, even if the home secretary does not. From Sonya Sceats, chief executive of Freedom from Torture (which was represented at the appeal hearing): This is a victory for reason and compassion … As we outlined in our intervention in the court of appeal, this dirty deal with Rwanda does too little to identify and protect survivors and other vulnerable groups and would see them placed at risk of further harm. From Enver Solomon, CEO of the Refugee Council: We are relieved that the court of appeal has ruled that Rwanda is not a safe country for people who claim asylum. However, we’re disappointed that they have not concluded that the overall policy is unlawful. Let’s remember that the UK made an international commitment under the refugee convention to provide a safe haven for those fleeing for their lives who seek protection on our soil. From Sacha Deshmukh, Amnesty International UK’s chief executive: This judgment is very welcome, but it can’t undo the enormous suffering, harm and expense already caused by the government’s long and reckless pursuit of a patently unjust scheme. From Aisha Dodwell, head of campaigns for the Catholic aid agency Cafod: It is time for the government to look again at its shameful policy and its treatment of migrants and refugees. As Pope Francis has made clear, the world needs to show maximum respect for the dignity of each migrant by building bridges, not walls, as well as providing routes for safe and regular migration. The ruling of the court of appeal on Rwanda was described as “deeply disappointing” by the Tory MP and former levelling up secretary Sir Simon Clarke, who said he would anticipate “an immediate appeal” to the supreme court. “We have to be able to control our borders. If the ECHR continues to forestall this, we have to revisit the question of our membership,” he added, referring to the European convention on human rights, cited in the judgment today as the reason for the Rwanda policy being unlawful. (See 10.29am.) Some Tories want the UK to leave the ECHR, to remove legal objections to the deportation of asylum seekers, and some MPs want the party to make this a manifesto proposal at the next election. Other rightwingers were also critical of the ruling. Nigel Farage, the former Ukip and then Brexit party leader, said the judiciary would “always do their best to assist illegal immigration”. And Richard Tice, leader of Reform UK (the successor to the Brexit party), said the ruling was “disgraceful”. Brendan Clarke-Smith, one of the Boris Johnson-supporting Tories criticised by the Commons privileges committee (see 9.19am), has said he is “shocked and disappointed” by its findings. The committee criticised Clarke-Smith for posting this message on Twitter on 9 June, the day when Boris Johnson resigned as an MP with a statement denouncing the draft privileges committee report he had been shown confidentially. At that point the final report had not been published. Tonight we saw the end result of a parliamentary witch-hunt which would put a banana republic to shame. It is the people of this country who elect and decide on their MPs. It’s called democracy and we used to value it here. Sadly this no longer appears to be the case. Mark Jenkinon, another Johnsonite Tory named in the report today, has also rejected its conclusions. He accused it of “gross overreach”. In its report the committe highlighted this message from Jenkinson, also posted on Twitter on 9 June. When the witch-hunt has been forgotten, future generations will look back in astonishment. The Rwandan government has issued a statement contesting the court of appeal’s decision that it is not a safe third country. Yolande Makolo, a spokesperson for the Rwandan government, said: While this is ultimately a decision for the UK’s judicial system, we do take issue with the ruling that Rwanda is not a safe country for asylum seekers and refugees. Rwanda is one of the safest countries in the world and we have been recognised by the UNHCR and other international institutions for our exemplary treatment of refugees. We make a significant contribution to dealing with the impacts of the global migration crisis. Rwandans know what it means to be forced to flee home, and to make a new life in a new country. As a society, and as a government, we have built a safe, secure, dignified environment, in which migrants and refugees have equal rights and opportunities as Rwandans. Everyone relocated here under this partnership will benefit from this. Rwanda remains fully committed to making this partnership work. The broken global migration system is failing to protect the vulnerable, and empowering criminal smuggling gangs at an immeasurable human cost. When the migrants do arrive, we will welcome them and provide them with the support they’ll need to build new lives in Rwanda. In his statement to summarising the court of appeal’s ruling, Lord Burnett, the lord chief justice, stressed that it was not making a political assessment of the Rwanda policy. He said: The court of appeal makes clear that its decision implies no view whatever about the political merits or otherwise of the Rwanda policy. Those are entirely a matter for the government, on which the court has nothing to say. The court’s concern is only whether the policy complies with the law as laid down by parliament. This passage, from the summary of the court of appeal’s judgment, explains why it decided that Rwanda was not a safe third country. The decision of the majority – the Master of the Rolls, Sir Geoffrey Vos, and Lord Justice Underhill (the vice-president of the court of appeal (Civil Division)) – is that the deficiencies in the asylum system in Rwanda are such that there are substantial grounds for believing that there is a real risk that persons sent to Rwanda will be returned to their home countries where they faced persecution or other inhumane treatment, when, in fact, they have a good claim for asylum. In that sense Rwanda is not a “safe third country”. That conclusion is founded on the evidence which was before the high court that Rwanda’s system for deciding asylum claims was, in the period up to the conclusion of the Rwanda agreement, inadequate. The court is unanimous in accepting that the assurances given by the Rwandan government were made in good faith and were intended to address any defects in its asylum processes. However, the majority believes that the evidence does not establish that the necessary changes had by then been reliably effected or would have been at the time of the proposed removals. In consequence sending anyone to Rwanda would constitute a breach of article 3 of the European convention on human rights, with which parliament has required that the government must comply (Human Rights Act 1998, section 6). Originally the hight court ruled that in principle Rwanda was a safe third country. But the high court found in favour of asylum seekers challenging the decision to send them to Rwanda because of the way their cases had been handled. But the court of appeal’s decision was not unanimous. Lord Burnett, the lord chief justice, concluded Rwanda was a safe country. But he was “outvoted” by the other two judges sitting with him. In agreement with the high court, the lord chief justice, the Lord Burnett of Maldon, has reached the opposite conclusion. He agrees that the procedures put in place under the Rwanda agreement and the assurances given by the Rwandan government are sufficient to ensure that there is no real risk that asylum-seekers relocated under the Rwanda policy will be wrongly returned to countries where they face persecution or other inhumane treatment. He has concluded that the chances of failed asylum seekers being returned to their countries of origin are in any event low, not least because Rwanda has no agreements in place with any of the countries in question. In addition, extensive monitoring arrangements, formal and informal, of all those sent to Rwanda and their asylum claims once there provide powerful protection. The arrangements put in place provide sufficient safeguards in a context where both governments will be determined to make the agreement work and be seen to do so. Here is the summary of the court of appeal’s judgment in the Rwanda case. And here is the full 161-page judgment. Here is the key passage from the summary of the judgment by Lord Burnett, the lord chief justice. He said: The result is that the high court’s decision that Rwanda was a safe third country is reversed and that unless and until the deficiencies in its asylum processes are corrected, removal of asylum seekers to Rwanda will be unlawful. Here is more Twitter comment on the ruling. From Danny Shaw, a former BBC home affairs correspondent From Colin Yeo, an immgiration barrister These are from Colin Yeo, a barrister specialising in immigration cases. Lord Burnett says the court is allowing the appeal from campaigners acting on behalf of asylum seekers on the grounds of Rwanda being a safe third country. But he says the court is not allowing the appeal on other grounds. The court of appeal is now giving is judgment on the Rwanda appeal. There is a live feed at the top of the blog. Lord Burnett, the lord chief justice, is now setting out the background to the case. The essential issue is whether the Rwanda system could deliver reliable outcomes, he says. He says the appellants argued that asylum seekers sent to Rwanda might be returned to their home country when they had a good case for asylum. He says the high court approved the Rwanda policy in principle, but objected to how it was applied in particular cases. Jacob Rees-Mogg declined to comment on the privileges committee report when he was doorstepped by reporters this morning. He told ITV he was going to church, and then to the Test match. The Suella Braverman statement in the Commons on the court of appeal judgment on the Rwanda deportations policy will take place at about 5pm. The ruling itself is due within the next few minutes. In its report the Commons privileges committee says there were legitimate ways by which MPs could have sought to influence its inquiry into Boris Johnson. It says that they got the chance to vote on it when it was set up; that they could have submitted evidence to the committee about the subject of its investigation, or about its procedures; and that they had a vote on the final report. But some of Boris Johnson’s allies did not do this, it says. Those members did not choose to engage through any proper process such as the submission of letters or evidence to our inquiry, but by attacking the members of the committee, in order to influence their judgment. Their aim was to (1) influence the outcome of the inquiry, (2) impede the work of the committee by inducing members to resign from it, (3) discredit the committee’s conclusions if those conclusions were not what they wanted, and (4) discredit the committee as a whole. The Commons privileges committee says the campaign against its Boris Johnson inquiry waged by some of his supporters had a “significant personal impact” on members of the committee. In the report it says: Pressure was applied particularly to Conservative members of the committee. This had the clear intention to drive those members off the committee and so to frustrate the intention of the house that the inquiry should be carried out, or to prevent the inquiry coming to a conclusion which the critics did not want. There were also sustained attempts to undermine and challenge the impartiality of the chair [Harriet Harman], who had been appointed to the committee by unanimous decision of the house. This unprecedented and co-ordinated pressure did not affect the conduct or outcome of our inquiry. However, it had significant personal impact on individual members and raised significant security concerns. If abuse of members who are carrying out the duties imposed on them by the house is allowed to continue, it is reasonable to conclude that in future members would decline to serve on the committee, or there might be a reluctance on the part of individuals approached as external advisers to serve in that role. If that happens, rather than making its decisions with the assistance of a report from a committee which can take advice and gather and evaluate evidence, the house might feel compelled to cede to an external authority the responsibility for protection of its rights and privileges. The Commons privileges committee is not directly calling for sanctions against the MPs it says interfered with its Boris Johnson inquiry. And the Commons does not have the power to impose sanctions on peers anyway. But it does want the Commons to pass a motion that would back up the criticism in the report of the conduct of some of Boris Johnson’s allies. It also says the Commons should consider if “further action” needs to be taken against the MPs named. It says: We recommend that the house agree a resolution in the following terms: That this house: a) notes with approval the special report from the committee of privileges; b) considers that where the house has agreed to refer a matter relating to individual conduct to the committee of privileges, members of this house should not impugn the integrity of that committee or its members or attempt to lobby or intimidate those members or to encourage others to do so, since such behaviour undermines the proceedings of the house and is itself capable of being a contempt; and c) considers it expedient that the House of Lords is made aware of the special report and this resolution, so that that house can take such action as it deems appropriate. If the government fails to table such a motion within a reasonable time, we note that any member has the power to write to the speaker to ask for the matters in this special report to be given precedence as a matter of privilege. If Mr Speaker does grant precedence, that member will be able to table an appropriate motion to enable the house to reach a decision on those matters. Such a motion would be debatable and amendable. It will be for the house to consider what further action, if any, to take in respect of members of the house referred to in this special report. The Commons privileges committee has criticised in particular seven MPs and one peer for posting tweets, or giving comments to the media, that it describeds as “some of the most disturbing examples of the co-ordinated campaign to interfere with” its inquiry into Boris Johnson. The quotes are set out in an annex to the report. The MPs are: Nadine Dorries, the former culture secretary (who seems to be the worst offender – four of her remarks are quoted) Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former business secretary and former leader of the Commons (the next worst – two of his remarks are quoted) Mark Jenkinson Michael Fabricant Brendan Clarke-Smith Andrea Jenkyns Priti Patel, the former home secretary And the peer is Zac Goldsmith, who is a Foreign Office minister. The report says: By his ruling on 6 March 2023, the Speaker prevented abuse within the house, but what needs to be addressed is the campaign waged outside parliament by some members of the House of Commons and the House of Lords to undermine the committee. Those involved used newspapers and radio and there was extensive use of social media. There were many examples but the committee is particularly concerned about attacks mounted by experienced colleagues, including a serving minister of the Crown, a former leader of the house and a former secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport, and at least three members of the House of Lords (one of whom is the serving minister referred to above) who took it upon themselves to undermine procedures of the House of Commons. The former and current members of the Government we have referred to are privy counsellors. We have not catalogued every tweet or TV appearance, but have set out in an annex to this report some of the most disturbing examples of the co-ordinated campaign to interfere with the work of the committee. The annex includes the statements made by the individuals referred to above and of others who followed their example. This matter is made more difficult because two of the Members mounting the most vociferous attacks on the Committee did so from the platform of their own hosted TV shows. Attacks by experienced Members are all the more concerning as they would have known that during the course of an investigation it was not possible for the privileges committee to respond to the attacks. The report also criticises two other Tory peers, Lord Cruddas and Lord Greenhalgh. It says: An example of selective pressure brought to bear on Conservative members of the Committee was the email campaign instigated by the Conservative Post website, urging those members to stand aside from the committee and alleging that the inquiry was “deeply flawed, biased and unfair”. Two members of the House of Lords, whose peerages were conferred on the recommendation of Mr Johnson, were among over 600 people who emailed committee members using the template email devised by Conservative Post. Conservative Post is the online magazine of the Conservative Democratic Organisation, whose President is Lord Cruddas and whose Vice-President is Lord Greenhalgh. The Commons privileges committee has published its report. It’s here. Suella Braverman, the home secretary, will make a statement in the Commons later about the court of appeal ruling on the Rwanda policy. Lord Cruddas, who was given a peerage by Boris Johnson despite the House of Lords appointments commissions saying he was unsuitable, posted an extended message on Twiter last night denying that he “intimidated” the Commons privileges committee and claiming that he is the victim of snobbery. He also repeated the claim they were a “kangaroo court”. He said: The Committee of Privileges is a House of Commons committee. It simply does not have the power to sanction people who aren’t MPs. The House of Lords is an independent body. Once again it has embarrassed Parliament by not understanding basic law. The idea I “intimidated” a committee of supposedly grown-up individuals is a nonsense. Worse frankly, it is defamatory of me and I suspect it is yet more snobbery directed at someone from the working class who has succeeded in life from these career politicians. Based on their ‘logic’ they are intimidating me and committing contempt of the House of Lords. If they don’t want people noticing they are a kangaroo court then they should hop less. Good morning. When the Commons privileges committee published its report two weeks ago saying Boris Johnson lied to MPs about Partygate, it said that it would be publishing a follow-up about attempts to “undermine” its inquiry. All Commons committees find their work subject to criticism, but in this case what triggered particular concern were comments suggesting that the Conservative members of the committee might face deselection if their report was critical of the former PM. In its report the committee said: From the outset of this inquiry there has been a sustained attempt, seemingly coordinated, to undermine the committee’s credibility and, more worryingly, that of those members serving on it. The committee is concerned that if these behaviours go unchallenged, it will be impossible for the house to establish such a committee to conduct sensitive and important inquiries in the future. The house must have a committee to defend its rights and privileges, and it must protect members of the house doing that duty from formal or informal attack or undermining designed to deter and prevent them from doing that duty. We will be making a special report separately to the house dealing with these matters. This report is now being published at 9am. And the committee seems to have firmed up its thinking. The “seemingly” has gone, and the report is called (according to the advance operational note put out by the committee) “Co-ordinated campaign of interference in the work of the Privileges Committee”. As Aubrey Allegretti reports in his preview story, the former cabinet ministers Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nadine Dorries, and the Tory peer Peter Cruddas, as three of the worst offenders. They all repeatedly criticised the committee, in derogatory terms, as it was carrying out its inquiry. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: The Commons privileges committee publishes its report on the “coordinated campaign of interference” with its investigation into Boris Johnson. 9.10am: James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, gives a speech at a Chatham House conference. 10am: The court of appeal issues its judgment in the appeal against a high court ruling saying the Home Office’s plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda was lawful. Morning: Nicola Sturgeon, the former Scottish first minister, gives evidence to the Covid inquiry. Morning: Keir Starmer is on a visit in North Yorkshire.

      "politics\/live\/2023\/jun\/28\/daniel-korski-conservatives-london-mayor-candidate-hopeful-labour-pmqs-uk-politics-latest Daniel Korski, one of three candidates on the shortlist to be the Conservative candidate to run for London’s mayor, has dropped out after a woman accused him of groping her 10 years ago. Peers have inflicted two defeats on the government over the illegal migration bill. In the first, they voted by a majority of 43 to insert a clause in the bill saying saying nothing in it would require any act that would breach the UK’s obligations under various human rights treaties. And in the second, which took place just now, they voted by 219 to 177 – a majority of 42 – in favour of an amendment tabled by the crossbench peer Lord Carlile saying the duty to deport in the bill would only apply to people arriving in the UK after it came into force, not retrospectively, as the government proposes. The debate is still going on, and further votes are expected. Contingency plans for the collapse of Thames Water are being drawn up by the UK government and the industry watchdog amid fears that Britain’s biggest water company cannot survive because of its huge debt pile. One in 10 GCSE-year pupils have been absent from school in England each day this year, up 70% since before the Covid pandemic, a Guardian investigation has found. There was some surprise good news for the government in the Lords debate on the second set of amendments to the illegal migration bill. Ken Clarke, the former chancellor who is now normally seen as being on the most liberal wing of the Conservative party, told peers that he was supporting the government on the bill. He voted with the government in the first division (on amendment 5), and when he spoke he said that previously he had not declared his views on the bill. He said that when it originally came to the Lords, he was in a “very, very troubled state of mind” because he found it hard to support. But he said that he accepted something needed to be done about people crossing the Channel on small boats, and he said the bill’s opponents did not have an alternative solution. He said: Concern about these dinghies and fishing boats bobbing on the ocean is actually beginning, if we’re not careful, to re-arouse all the bad feelings that we used to know from 20 or 30 years ago. That’s why over 60% of our population wish to stop illegal immigration. I’ve sat and tried to listen for a solution. Sadly, the only solution being put forward is this rather extraordinary one by the government, that we simply cease to entertain illegal immigration and deport to safe places. I have not heard a single alternative policy put forward. I’m not sure it will work but I’m still to hear anybody else offer anything but the possibility of litigation, or huge numbers of people coming here as the practice of trying to get over the Channel grows. Only two Conservative peers voted with opposition and crossbench peers in favour of amendment 5 to the illegal migration bill, the division lists shows. They were Patrick Cormack, the former MP, and Nick Bourne, the former leader of the Welsh Conservatives. Daniel Korski has pulled out of the race to be the Tory candidate in the mayoral race in London after a TV producer accused him of groping her a decade ago. In a statement reported by the Telegraph, Korski said: I have decided, with a heavy heart, to withdraw from the Conservative mayoral contest. I categorically deny the allegation against me. Nothing was ever put to me formally ten years ago. Nor seven years ago when the allegation was alluded to. No investigation has ever taken place. I have been clear I would welcome and constructively participate in any investigation. However, the pressure on my family because of this false and unproven allegation and the inability to get a hearing for my message of ‘The London Dream’ makes it impossible for my campaign to carry on. I am proud of having run a positive campaign that championed new ideas, technology and talent, and the years I have campaigned for the Conservative party and to make the lives of Londoners better. I believe strongly that Londoners deserve an uplifting and positive vision for their city. I tried hard to offer that. The news agenda is becoming a distraction from the race and the Conservative party. I wish the excellent remaining contestants well and I know the Conservative party’s eventual candidate will beat Sadiq Khan and offer the kind of rejuvenation London so desperately needs. I will do my utmost to support the Conservative party and the eventual Conservative candidate. Thank you to my family, friends and all my supporters. The government has lost the first vote on the illegal migration bill in today’s debate. Amendment 5 (see 4.05pm) was passed by 222 votes to 179 – a majority of 43. Lisa Nandy, the shadow levelling up secretary, appeared to contradict Sadiq Khan when she said she was opposed to rent controls this morning. (See 10.59am.) “Rent controls that cut rents for some will almost certainly leave others homeless,” she said at a conference in Manchester. It came a day after Khan, the Labour mayor of London, appeared to move in the opposite direction. He again called for powers to introduce rent controls in response to figures showing 1,700 more people are sleeping on the capital’s streets than last year. “Ministers should … give me the power to introduce a system of rent controls that work for London,” he said. He wants the power to freeze rents for two years. The two positions are not necessarily opposed as Nandy appears to be opposing mandating rent cuts while Khan wants a rent freeze. But the National Residential Landlords Association has seized on Nandy’s position. Ben Beadle, its chief executive, said: We agree with Labour that rent controls would do nothing to address the rental supply crisis that tenants across the country now face. What renters need is a proper plan to boost the supply of homes for private rent alongside all other tenures. Housing benefit rates should also be unfrozen without delay to support vulnerable tenants who are struggling to access the rental market. Yesterday the Labour Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, also said: “As to a rent freeze, it’s a blunt instrument; it has many unintended consequences. We know in Scotland that it has led to a reduction in properties available for rent.” Daisy Goodwin, the TV producer who has accused Daniel Korski of groping her in Downing Street 10 years ago, has given an interview to Times Radio which adds to what she told the Today programme this morning. (See 9.38am.) Here are the main points. Korski, of course, has strongly denied Goodwin’s allegation. Goodwin said that Korski failed to get a directorship at a government department after she told the chair about the groping incident. She said: At one point I heard that [Korski] was going up for a directorship at a government department, and I happen to know someone who was the chair of that board. We were talking about him, and I told that person the story of what had happened to me. And that person, who I really can’t name, was very grateful to me for that information. He didn’t get that directorship which suggests that – well, it’s interesting that he didn’t get that directorship and yet he’s been backed as a candidate for the Tory mayor. She said she thought that Korski has an “impulse control” problem and that he should not be in a position of power. She said: I’m angry because I think it’s wrong that this sort of thing goes on, especially in Downing Street. I think men with impulse control problems, which I think is what Daniel Korski has, are probably not the best people to run the country. That’s my considered opinion. I would imagine a lot of other people might agree with me on that. I just think people who can’t keep that to themselves should not be in positions of power. It’s not that I’m a prude. I just think you don’t grope virtual strangers in public. She said that Ian Hislop, the Private Eye editor, was the person who told her Korski was campaigning to be Tory candidate for mayor of London and that he encouraged her to name Korski as the person who groped her. Previously, she had talked about the incident in public, but without naming the man involved. In the House of Lords peers are now voting on amendment 5 to the illegal migration bill. You can read the text of it on the list of amendments here. Lord Murray, a Home Office minister, is responding to the debate. He says that there is nothing in the bill that requires an act that conflicts with the UK’s international obligations, and that, as a result, in one sense amendment 5 is unnecessary. But he says the UK has a dualist approach to law, meaning that international law is separate from domestic law. This amendment would incorporate international law in domestic law, meaning that people would be able to challenge the government on international law in the domestic courts. He says this means it would take “a wrecking ball to our long established constitutional arrangements”. Vernon Coaker, a shadow Home Office minister, told peers that Labour would be supporting amendment 5. Addressing Lord Wolfson’s argument (see 4.21pm), he said that if a country like the UK signs international treaties, it should abide by them. Lord Wolfson, who was made a peer and appointed a justice minister by Boris Johnson, told peers he was opposed to amendment 5. He said that, by passing it, peers would be incorporating five international treaties into domestic law. That would be a substantial change, he said, and not something the Lords should be doing in an amendment like this. Lord Paddick, the Lib Dem peer, is speaking now. He says if the UK does not comply with its international obligations, it is unlikely to receive the international cooperation needed to address the asylum problem. He also quotes the economic impact assessment published on Monday, pointing out that it says there is no academic research showing deterrence works in immigration policy. In the House of Lords peers have just started the report stage debate on the illegal migration bill. At least five votes are expected. Lady Williams, the government chief whip, told peers at the start of the debate that they were in for a “very long day”. She urged peers to keep their speeches short. Shami Chakrabarti, the Labour peer, was next up, and she took Williams at her word. She gave a two-minute speech defending amendment 5, which has also been signed by Lib Dem, Tory and crossbench peers. Amendment 5 would add a clause to the bill saying nothing in it would require any act that would breach the UK’s obligations under various international treaties. They are: the 1950 European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; the 1951 UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees including the Protocol to that Convention; the 1954 and 1961 UN Conventions on the Reduction of Statelessness; the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child; the 2005 Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking Human Beings. Chakrabarti says this amendment was essential for protecting the most vulnerable. It was also about upholding the “international rules-based order”, she said, and about maintaing “our reputation as a great democracy”. During PMQs Rishi Sunak said that over the past three years homebuilding had been at “almost record” numbers. He said: The record is that in the last three years we’ve delivered almost record numbers of new homebuilding in every one of those years. Full Fact, the fact checking organisation, says it is looking at this claim, although it says fact checking a vague assertion like “almost record” is not straightforward. But Full Fact did publish an analysis in March, after Sunak said housebuilding was at record levels. It concluded that this was arguable, but misleading. It explained: The number of ‘net additional dwellings’ did hit the highest point on record in 2019\/20, but these statistics only go back to the early 1990s. Other metrics and housing experts suggest that, while recent building figures are higher than in some previous years, they’re generally far lower than records set decades ago. At PMQs Rishi Sunak said that, following Jeremy Hunt’s meeting with regulators this morning, there would be an announcement later today about plans “to ensure fairness of pricing and supply chains to ease the burden on consumers”. School leaders in Wales have voted to continue taking industrial action, which could escalate to strikes, PA Media reports. PA says: Members of NAHT Cymru have been taking action short of a strike since February in a row over pay, workload and funding. They voted in March to reject an offer from the Welsh government covering both 2022\/23 and 2023\/24 and have now renewed their mandate for industrial action, which was due to expire in July. The ballot showed 95% support continuing action short of a strike, with 74% prepared to strike if needed. Downing Street and the Labour party have both condemned the Just Stop Oil protesters who disrupted the Test match at Lord’s this morning. At his post-PMQs lobby briefing, the PM’s spokesperson said: These sorts of selfish, guerrilla tactics that target events bringing joy to millions are exactly why the government brought in new powers so the police can take swift action. The prime minister is pleased play was able to resume quickly and thanks security staff, the swift hands of Jonny Bairstow and other England players who stepped in. And a Labour spokesperson said Just Stop Oil’s tactics were “counter-productive, dangerous and wrong”. He said: “This sort of activity is not appropriate or justifiable in any way.” Here is Simon Burnton’s story about the protest. In his Commons statement Steve Barclay, the health secretary, also said that a national inquiry into the safety of mental health care settings would be launched in the autumn. A new health services safety investigations body will be set up later this year, and the Department of Health and Social Care said it would “commence a national investigation into mental health inpatient care settings. It will investigate a range of issues, including how young people with mental health needs can be better cared for, how providers can learn from tragic deaths that take place in their care, how out-of-area placements are handled, and how staffing models can be improved.” Steve Barclay, the health secretary, has told MPs that the Essex mental health independent inquiry will be given statutory powers. The inquiry is investigating the deaths of around 2,000 mental health patients at Essex Partnership university NHS foundation trust (Eput) over a 20-year period. Making it statutory will mean staff can be compelled to give evidence. Barclay said he was responding to concerns about the lack of engagement with the inquiry from current and former Eput staff. Time is running out to enact wholesale changes to ensure Britain’s electoral system keeps pace with advances in artificial intelligence before the next general election, regulators fear. Ben Quinn has the story here. There was an urgent question in the Commons after PMQs about the crisis at Thames Water. Rebecca Pow, the environment minister, was responding, and she told MPs there was “a lot of work going on behind the scenes with Thames Water to ensure that cutomers will not be impacted”. Graeme Wearden has full details on his business live blog. Downing Street has refused to say whether or not Rishi Sunak thinks Daniel Korski is a suitable candidate to be Tory candidate for mayor of London in the light of the groping allegation against him. At the post-PMQs briefing, asked about this, the PM’s press secretary said: As you know there are three candidates and the prime minister does not endorse any single one candidate. Obviously these allegations are very serious. They are allegations that have obviously been denied by Daniel Korski himself. They should be handled in the proper way. Asked if Sunak believed Daisy Goodwin, who says she was groped by Korski 10 years ago, the press secretary replied: I’m not going to get into ‘he said, she said’. The two parties are telling different stories, the proper processes should be followed and conclusions shouldn’t be drawn on until the processes are followed through. The press secretary also said the vetting of mayoral candidates was a matter for the Conservative party. This morning Lisa Nandy gave a speech intended to position Labour, very firmly, as the party of home ownership. (See 10.59am.) It was the prelude to PMQs, where Keir Starmer’s script was crafted to drive home the same point. He taunted Sunak over a Tory byelection leaflet criticising plans to build 300,000 homes (despite this being government policy), and then hung him on a hook with an unanswerable question (would he admit that the target will be missed?). Then, in his fourth question, Starmer set up the key message. You can tell from his answer … his body language, he has actually given up. He has given up. And his failure isn’t just shuttering the dream of those who desperately want to own their own home, it’s also hitting those who already have a mortgage. Because of their economic chaos, mortgage holders will be £2,900 a year poorer. How can they ever look the British people in the eye again, and claim to be the party of home ownership? And Starmer pressed home his point as he started his fifth question. “At least he isn’t claiming they are the party of home ownership any more, because we are.” This was Starmer’s payload, although to many people the line about Sunak having “given up” will ring true, or at least partly, because the PM did sound more than usually defensive, and deflated, as he responded today. He made a series of claims about the government’s housing record, but politicians never get much credit for what has gone before even if their record stands up (and, on housing, the Conservatives’ doesn’t much). At PMQs the PM ideally needs something a bit stronger – a new announcement, or a popular policy that the opposition, for its own internal reasons, won’t support. Today Sunak sounded like someone running out of ammo. In those circumstances, the only option is to go negative. At the weekend the Sunday Times carried a fascinating account of a briefing to Tory MPs by the American pollster Frank Luntz that included this snippet. Luntz is also said to have made clear that the Conservatives, after Partygate and Truss’s disastrous mini-budget, are so badly damaged that their only way to victory at the next election is to wage a negative campaign. A general election must be held by January 2025, but is expected next year. One MP said: “Luntz said: ‘You guys won’t have a positive message that anybody will believe.’ He effectively said that we will have to convince voters that Labour is worse.” Today Sunak deployed two negative attack lines, accusing Starmer of inconsistency and hypocrisy. Here was the inconsistency one: I would say to [Labour MPs], though, they don’t have to worry too much because he has never actually kept a promise he has made. Sunak often makes this point, and there is some truth in it; Starmer has shifted a lot on policy in his three years as leader. But it is not decisive as an argument because Sunak has been inconsistent too, and the Conservative party has had three leaders since the election who have been anything but consistent. Sunak was on stronger ground when he accused Labour of hypocrisy, listing members of the shadow cabinet guilty of alleged nimbyism. He now claims that he supports housebuilding, especially on the green belt. But unfortunately for him, the shadow deputy prime minister, the shadow minister for women, the shadow health, justice, defence, business, Northern Ireland and Scotland ministers are all united against more housebuilding in their areas. But this does not quite clinch the argument either, because people understand that MPs have to take a stance on local issues, and that supporting more housebuilding does not have to mean supporting every housing application in the whole country. What matters is the stance of the party as a whole. In this respect, on housebuilding, Starmer is winning. Martin Docherty-Hughes (SNP) asks if Sunak agrees with MI5, that Evgeny Lebedev should not be in the Lords, or does he agree with Boris Johnson that he should. That is a reference to this story. Sunak says he will reply in general terms. The Lords appointments commission vets people. If it is opposed to a nomination, it has said it will write publicly to the relevant Commons committee, he says. Paul Bristow (Con) asks about a Traveller establishment in his constituency in a park where a festival is due to take place at the weekend. Will the PM make it clear that the police should use the powers they have to clear this? Sunak says he recognises the misery unauthorised encampments can cause. This is an operational matter for the police, he says. But he says the government would not have given them those powers if they were not expected to use them. Stewart McDonald (SNP) asks Sunak to appoint an official to collect war crimes evidence against the Wagner group. Sunak says the government has criticised the Wagner group, and included it in sanctions. Shaun Bailey (Con) asks about a strike by bin workers in Sandwell. He criticises Labour for being on the side of the strikers. Sunak says Labour is unable to stand up to the unions. It is not strong enough to support the strikes bill, he says. Janet Daby (Lab) asks about a constituent who needs to use food banks, despite having two part-time jobs. What is the PM’s message to her? Sunak says the government has taken action to help people with the cost of living. Energy bills are set to fall, he says. Ian Mearns (Lab) asks if the government will legislate for a register of children missing school. Sunak says missing school can be very damaging. The government has spent £5bn on Covid catch-up schemes, he says. He does not address the question about the register. Jane Stevenson (Con) asks Sunak to celebrate apprenticeship in the aerospace industry. Sunak agrees, and says thousands of jobs will be created in the aerospace industry as a result of the fighter jet agreement with Japan and Italy. Samantha Dixon (Lab) asks why the PM thinks it is acceptable for sewage to be pumped into the River Dee in Chester. Sunak says that is not acceptable. He says the government has toughened the rules on sewage discharges. Damien Moore (Con) asks about Southport pier. Sunak says the government is providing £2m to undertake improvements there. He says it has the second largest town deal in the country. Alison McGovern (Lab) asks what will happen if Sunak fails to meet his promise to halve inflation. Will he call an election? Sunak says he is sticking to the plan, taking responsible decisions. James Duddridge (Con) says the Commonwealth parliamentary association is leaving the UK. Will the government intervene to ensure it can stay? Sunak says the Foreign Office is looking at this. Greg Smith (Con) asks if the PM supports the plan to develop his local hospital. Sunak says new hospital schemes will be considered throught the rolling progamme for capital projects in the NHs. Chris Bryant says Sunak has been in charge of the economy for 1,321 days. He has delivered “the largest national peacetime debt ever, the largest tax burden since the second world war, the highest for inflation since 1991, the fastest interest rate rises since 1989 and the biggest fall in living standards in our history”. He is the worst person to lecture the public, he says. Sunak says Labour policy would make the situation worse. Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader at Westminster, says corporate greed is driving up inflation. She says the IMF said companies should cut profit margins. Sunak says the IMF has backed the government’s policies. Wendy Morton (Con) asks about the closure of a police station in her constituency. Sunak says he is concerned about this. It is an important issue, he says. But it was a decision by the Labour police and crime commissioners, he says. Stephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster, accused the PM of patronising the public by telling them to hold their nerve. When did he, a near billionaire, struggle to pay a bill? Sunak says tackling inflation is the right policy. The government is taking practical steps to support mortgage holders. Flynn says the PM is out of touch, and the Tories will soon be out of time. The Tories and Labour are both refusing to accept recommendations on public sector pay. Sunak says Flynn has exposed the economic illiteracy of SNP policy. He talked about the cost of living, and then backed a policy that would make it worse, he says. UPDATE: Flynn said: On Sunday, the prime minister patronised the public when he told them that in the face of ever-increasing mortgage bills, that they simply need to ‘hold their nerve’. What a nerve. So may I ask him, the near-billionaire, when was the last time that he struggled to pay a bill? And Sunak replied: The reason that mortgage rates are rising is because of inflation. That is the root cause, which is why it’s absolutely the right policy to tackle, halve inflation and reduce it back to target. Now, that does mean that we do have to make difficult decisions. It does mean we have to be patient while the impact of those decisions actually has an impact. But in the meantime … we are taking practical steps to support mortgage holders across the United Kingdom, particularly through the SMI [Support for Mortgage Interest] scheme and the new mortgage charter. Jason McCartney (Con) says infrastructure levies from developers in his areas do not seem to be going on infrastructure. Sunak says this is a good point. It is why the government is reforming the sytem, which is too slow. There will be a new, non-negotiable local infrastructure levy. Starmer says, instead of lecturing the country on holding their nerve, Sunak should locate his. Sunak says Starmer has not taken the time to understand the mortgage charter. It goes further than Labour’s, he says. He says he is doing what he says. That is the difference; he delivers on his promises, while Starmer breaks his. Starmer says at least the Tories are not claiming to be the party of home ownership “because we are”. He also says Sunak has not done enough to force banks to offer more protection to people with mortgages. Sunak says the number of first-time buyers is at its highest level for 20 years. Starmer says Sunak has given up. Mortgage holders will be £2,900 poorer under the Tories. How can they claim to be the party of home ownership? Sunak says the shadow housing secretary has opposed housebuilding in their constituency. You can’t believe a word they say. Starmer says, one minute the Tories are in favour of more houses, the next they are against it. Why won’t he admit he will not meet his target? Sunak says Starmer claims to want to build more homes. But he names shadow cabinet ministers who he says are against housebuilding in their areas. But they don’t have to worry, he says – because Starmer has never kept a promise he has made. Starmer says it was not a difficult question. Can Sunak name anyone who thinks the government will hit its target? Sunak says the government is building more homes. He attacks Labour’s policy. Keir Starmer says last week Margaret McDonagh, Labour’s first female general secretary, died. He pays tribute to her, and says he will be “forever grateful” for her advice. He says the Tories have been putting out adverts (in Uxbridge) attacking plans to build 300,000 homes a year. But this is government policy. Is he for it or against it? Sunak says housing starts are double the number they were under Labour. And there is a 20-year high for first-time buyers, he says. Luke Evans (Con) says there has been significant investment in health in Leicestershire. But he is looking for more, for investment in a day case unit. Sunak says this is a matter for the local health authority. Rishi Sunak starts by saying today will see the second reading of the Holocaust memorial bill. He says he hopes MPs will unite to back it. Rishi Sunak is likely to be asked about the crisis at Thames Water at PMQs. This is what Mel Stride, the work and pensions secretary, said when he was asked about this on his LBC phone-in this morning. Ofwat has as part of its remit a requirement to look at the resilience of the entire sector and will have been looking at and continue to look very closely at Thames Water. Government as well has contingency arrangements in place to cover any scenario which may play out and what I’m supremely confident of is whatever the situation is at Thames Water, the water will continue to flow. PMQs is coming up soon. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. This afternoon the House of Lords will start the report stage debate of the illegal migration bill. Peers have already spent six days debating other stages of the bill, but the report stage debates are the most important ones because this is when amendments get put to a vote. This morning the Equality and Human Rights Commission has put out a new statement saying it remains “seriously concerned” about the potential impact of the bill on human rights and on the safety of migrants. A spokesperson said: We remain seriously concerned about the potential implications of the illegal migration bill on human rights and the safety of individuals. Careful consideration should continue to be given to the impact of the bill on different groups with protected characteristics – including children, pregnant women, disabled people, torture survivors, and victims of trafficking. The EHRC (a government quango, not an independent charity) is also encouraging peers to vote for amendments that would insert fresh human rights protections into the bill. It explains why it thinks these amendments are needed in a lengthy briefing note. Momentum, the leftwing Labour group, has criticised Lisa Nandy for opposing rent controls and mortgage relief in her speech this morning. (See 10.59am.) A Momentum spokesperson said: Millions of renters and mortgage holders are struggling to make ends meet. With the Tory government shrugging its shoulders, Labour has both the opportunity and the obligation to set out the decisive action needed. It beggars belief, then, that Lisa Nandy has criticised calls for rent controls, which she herself backed just months ago, and mortgage relief. Once again, policies supported by unions, Labour members and progressive Labour Mayors like Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham are rejected by a UK Labour Leadership which seems allergic to good, popular policy. On mortgage relief, Nandy said: “Untargeted mortgage relief that fuels the inflation crisis is no substitute for stabilising the economy and getting interest rates under control.” Lisa Nandy, the shadow levelling up secretary, has been speaking at the Housing 23 conference in Manchester. She did not announce anything specific, but in terms of “vibes” not policy, it was significant; it planted Labour very, very fimrly on the side of home owners, and first time buyers. Here are the key points from her speech and Q&amp;A. Nandy said there was nothing “Tory” about Labour wanting to be the party of home ownership. Referring to Keir Starmer’s plan to get home ownership levels up to 70% (it was 63% in England towards the end of the last decade), she said: Frankly I was astonished by the reaction of some people in my own party who said this was Tory lite. They argued home ownership and social housing were a zero sum game and we were making the wrong choice. To those people I say you couldn’t be more wrong. The biggest and most consequential divide in Britain today is between the people and the communities who have assets - and those who don’t. If you want people to have real resilience in their lives, they need the assets that sustain them and help them weather hard times, and offer choices and chances when times are good – like your own home or the child savings funds set up by the last Labour government. And they need common assets, like council housing which provides a secure home for life, handed back to be used for future generations. She defended the “right to buy” (council homes), saying it was originally a Labour idea and that it only went wrong under Margaret Thatcher because the proceeds were not used to build more homes. She said: The right to buy – whose abolition has come to be a totemic issue for many on the left - was originally a Labour policy. It was the decision of the Thatcher government to fail to replace the council housing stock that was sold, pitting the rights of the individual against the rights of the community. In the Q&amp;A, she also said she did not want to suspend right to buy. Peter Apps, deputy editor of Inside Housing (who recently won the Orwell prize for his brilliant, brilliant book Show Me the Bodies: How We Let Grenfell Happen), thinks Nandy’s argument on this – that she supports right to buy, but not the loss of council or social housing – is incoherent. Nandy said Labour would “tilt the balance” in housing towards first time buyers. She said: We will tilt the balance of power back to first time buyers and use the power of the state to help them make the leap into home ownership. She signalled that Labour was opposed to rent controls. She said: When housebuilding is falling off a cliff and buy to let landlords are leaving the market, rent controls that cut rents for some, will almost certainly leave others homeless. But she also said Labour would give more power to tenants. She said: We’ll make it our mission to hand power back to tenants in the private rented sector and end the feudal system of leasehold which has left millions trapped. She attacked Conservative housing policy on the grounds that it marked a shift “from bricks to benefits”. She explained: The last decade has been defined by a shift from ‘bricks to benefits’. The government now spends 10 times more on housing benefit than on creating affordable homes. And while the costs of housing benefit and subsidies for first-time buyers mount up, year on year we fail to build the homes we need. She also criticised Tory housing policy on the grounds that it did not do enough to promote competition. She said: After the war the health and housing minister Nye Bevan concluded that only by bringing in councils to plan the housing that developers would deliver could they fulfil the promise to a generation returning from war. He would be shocked by our housing system today – ad hoc, piecemeal – desperately lacking a plan. But imagine too what Adam Smith, the founding father of modern Conservatism would have made of a market that creates no incentive for competition, innovation or quality? A broken market and an absent state is the worst of all worlds. A state of affairs as fundamentally anathema to the Conservative tradition as it is socialism. She said Labour’s plan to build more on the green belt would focus on “poor quality” green belt land. She explained: We will take on the taboo that prevents us being honest about what the green belt is and what it isn’t. Because for all the yelping from Number 10 since we announced this plan, it is successive Tory governments that have presided over the loss of large tracts of high-quality green belt, the nature-rich greenfield land which protects the character of local communities. We will instead release poor-quality ex-industrial land and dilapidated, neglected scrubland to build more housing. So we see no more examples like the affordable housing development in Tottenham that was frustrated because a disused petrol station was technically designated as green belt land. She said there would be further announcements about Labour’s plans for social housing in the coming months. Specialists are carrying out urgent checks on almost 600 schools in England identified as being at possible risk of structural collapse because of crumbling concrete, with many more not aware of the danger of their buildings, according to a report from the National Audit Office. My colleague Sally Weale has the story. Commenting on the report, Gareth Davies, head of the NAO, told the Today programme this morning the risk was “very serious”. He explained: It’s particularly focused on these lightweight concrete buildings, and there’s a similar issue in hospitals actually, but in the case of schools 65 of these schools have been positively identified, there’s a large number more that are still being investigated. Out of those 65, 24 have had urgent action taken immediately – including closure, in some cases. So this isn’t a theoretical risk. It’s a real risk. And clearly, it’s important that the department and government as a whole brings that down below critical level where it currently sits. Contingency plans for the collapse of Thames Water are reportedly being drawn up by the UK government and the water watchdog, amid fears that Britain’s biggest water company cannot survive because of its huge debt pile, Julia Kollewe and Graeme Wearden report. Jeremy Hunt’s meeting with regulators in Downing Street has finished, but the heads of the regulatory bodies declined to comment as they left, PA Media reports. PA says: The chancellor met with the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and regulators for the energy, water and communications sectors to press them on whether there is a profiteering problem and what they can do to tackle it. Sarah Cardell from the CMA, David Black of Ofwat and Jonathan Brearley of Ofgem all declined to comment as they left 11 Downing Street. Claire Coutinho, the education minister, was giving interviews on behalf of the government this morning. In the past she has praised Daniel Korski’s “clear vision for London”, but this morning she said her support for him was “on pause” given the allegations against him. She said: I would say I’d be on pause at the moment because lots of things are happening. Asked to confirm she was suspending her support, she said: Yes, because I think we need to see what’s happened. But, at the same time, this is an allegation. He’s roundly denied it. If there is a complaint in the system, it needs to be followed up swiftly so we can find the facts and see what’s happened, but I do think it’s a very serious and concerning allegation. Good morning. When the Conservative party announced the names of the three people on the shortlist to be their candidate for London mayor next year, they got minimal media coverage. The best known candidate, Paul Scully, the minister for London, was off the list, and the three people still in the contest were relatively obscure. “Furious London Tories fear low-wattage mayor shortlist looks like surrender” was the headline on our (very good) analysis by Peter Walker and Pippa Crerar. But the contest has now become headline news after Daniel Korski, a policy adviser in No 10 when David Cameron was PM, was accused by Daisy Goodwin, a TV producer, of groping her in Downing Street 10 years ago. Korski has strongly denied the allegation. Goodwin named Korksi in an article in the Times. This morning she gave her first broadcast interview since writing that piece, and it will increase pressure on Korski to withdraw from the contest. Goodwin suggested that other women might come forward with allegations about Korski. She told the Today programme: Since I wrote my piece, I have been contacted by other women with some very interesting stories, which clearly I can’t talk about for legal reasons. But I feel entirely justified in having written the piece and naming him. The Today programme said it put this to Korski’s team, and they said he welcomed any investigation into what he had done. They also stressed that he had categorically denied Goodwin’s allegation. Goodwin firmly rejected a suggestion that she might have misinterpreted what happend. Asked by Martha Kearney if there had been any ambiguity about what happened, Goodwin replied: I’m really surprised you’re asking me that, Martha. Yes, it happened to me 10 years ago, but when something like this happens to you, you know that it happened to you because you were there, you felt it, you felt amazed, shocked and rather humiliated. To ask me if I’m certain is to as me if I’m making it up. That’s not the case. When it was put to her that Korski had denied it categorically, Goodwin replied: Well, he would say that, wouldn’t he. If he had come forward and said, ‘Oh, I’m really sorry, something like this, I might have inadvertently touched her’, that would be a different story. But the fact that he has categorically denied it is, to me, bizarre. She said she tried yesterday to make an official complaint about this – but did not have much luck. She said she called No 10 yesterday and eventually got through to someone who said they could not take a message. Then she emailed the Cabinet Office, and she received an out-of-office message with a note about who to contact in an emergency. She did not get a reply until the Times ran a story saying she was submitting a complaint, and then an official did get in touch, she said. Here is the agenda for the day. Morning: Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, holds a meeting with regulators to discuss what they can do to keep prices down. 9am: Lisa Nandy, the shadow levelling up secretary, gives a speech to the Housing 23 conference in Manchester. 9am: Mel Stride, the work and pensions secretary, takes part in an LBC phone-in. 12pm: Rishi Sunak faces Keir Starmer at PMQs. After 3.30pm: Peers begin the report stage debate on the illegal migration bill. If you want to contact me, do try the “send us a message” feature. You’ll see it just below the byline – on the left of the screen, if you are reading on a PC or a laptop. This is for people who want to message me directly. I find it very useful when people message to point out errors (even typos – no mistake is too small to correct). Often I find your questions very interesting too. I can’t promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either in the comments below the line, privately (if you leave an email address and that seems more appropriate), or in the main blog, if I think it is a topic of wide interest.\n",
      "politics\/live\/2023\/jun\/27\/tories-labour-migrant-children-rwanda-rishi-sunak-keir-starmer-matt-hancock-covid-inquiry-uk-politics-live Matt Hancock has said he is “profoundly sorry” for his part in mistakes that meant the UK was not properly prepared for Covid, telling the public inquiry into the pandemic that he had not properly challenged assurances that sufficient planning was in place. Boris Johnson committed an unambiguous breach of the rules when he failed to get permission from the ministerial appointments watchdog before taking a job as a Daily Mail columnist, which has led to calls for reform of the “good chaps” system. The Conservatives will not investigate a claim by a TV producer that one of its London mayoral hopefuls groped her at No 10, as a spokesperson for Rishi Sunak said Downing Street was a safe place for women. Senior doctors in England have voted to strike in overwhelming numbers for the first time in the row over pay. The announcement came after the Royal College of Nursing said its members have failed to vote in sufficient numbers for further strike action. Alex Chalk, the justice secretary, has told MPs the government is abandoning the bill of rights championed by his predecessor, Dominic Raab. As Jason Groves from the Mail reports, Raab has described this as “disappointing”. Ipsos has published some fresh polling today. It is available in full here, and Keiran Pedley from the firm has a good Twitter thread summing up the main findings which starts here. There is plenty of interesting material in the survey but, in the light of the importance of the economy in deciding the outcome of elections, two findings stand out. First, Labour has a big lead over the Conservatives on which party would get best value from public spending. And, second, Rachel Reeves has a 12-point lead over Jeremy Hunt on who would make the best chancellor. This is not the first time the shadow chancellor has led on this measure since 2010, but no shadow chancellor has been this far ahead in the last 13 years. Ed Balls came closest, leading George Osborne by eight points in the summer of 2012, after Osborne’s “omnishambles” budget. In the Commons two MPs, Caroline Nokes (Con) and Chris Bryant (Lab), have just used point of orders to condemn Andrew Bridgen for retweeting a tweet from Laurence Fox, the leader of the Reclaim party, about the vote on his 10-minute rule bill. (See 4.05pm.) In the extended tweet, Fox named the Tories who voted against the Bridgen bill and claimed they had voted in favour of “the grooming and mutilation of children”. Nokes said Bridgen should face a sanction for this, and Bryant, who chairs the Commons standards committee, said the Fox tweet amounted to incitement to violence. It was probably libellous too, he said. Nigel Evans, the deputy speaker who was in charge, said he was not responsible for what MPs tweeted. But MPs should always remember the importance of moderation, he said. He also said he thought this would not be the last word on this matter. Senior doctors in England have voted to strike in overwhelming numbers for the first time in the row over pay, Rachel Hall reports. Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, has signed an agreement with the EU that will see London and Brussels working closer together on financial services and coordinating before big international meetings, PA Media reports. PA says: Hunt said that the memorandum of understanding would help to support the UK and London’s role as a hub of financial services around the world. The sector makes up more than a tenth of the British economy, being worth more than a quarter of a trillion pounds last year. However, EU officials said the deal only sets up a space where the two sides can speak to each other. “It will set up a forum to facilitate dialogue,” Daniel Ferrie, a spokesperson for the European Commission, said in a tweet. “It does not restore UK access to EU, nor prejudges adoption of equivalence decisions.” MPs have voted down a motion proposing to ban social transition practices in schools. The division came after Andrew Bridgen, who was expelled from the Conservative party and who now represents the Reclaim party, gave a speech under the 10-minute rule procedure asking for permission to introduce a schools (gender and parental rights) bill. Normally, after an MP introduces a 10-minute rule bill, the Commons grants permission without a vote for the legislation to be formally introduced, knowing that that is the end of the process because time is never available for it to go any further. But this afternoon MPs forced a vote, and the Bridgen motion was defeated by 40 votes to 34. The Bridgen bill would “prohibit the promotion of social transition practices in school; require schools to inform parents if their child has indicated an intention to pursue, or has commenced, social transition; [and] provide for a right for parents to access information about lessons in schools”. Bridgen told MPs: Under all our noses, members of society, either politically or educationally tasked with helping bring up our children have turned raising the next generation into a science experiment with consequences that break my heart. Social transition practices in school have now become the norm in every classroom in the country. But Labour’s Ben Bradshaw said the proposal was “despicable”. He explained: Trans and non-binary people have always existed. Gender dysphoria has been in internationally-recognised condition for decades … Schools have become very experienced at handling social transitioning with both sensitivity and professionalism. The impact of this bill would turn the clock back to an age in which the very existence of trans and non-binary people, a tiny minority, was simply not acknowledged. Bridgen was supported by 25 Tories, six DUP MPs and one independent. But 10 Tories were among the 40 MPs who voted the bill down. Matt Hancock was confronted by bereaved family members, including one dressed as the Grim Reaper, as he left the Covid inquiry, PA Media reports. PA says: Charles Persinger, 58, lost his wife and his mother to coronavirus, one month apart. His mother, Susan Persinger, died in January 2021 aged 74, while his wife. Katie Persinger, a care home manager, died in February 2021 aged 51. As Hancock got into his car, Persinger, dressed as the Grim Reaper, shouted sarcastically after him: “I’m a big fan of your work.” Daniel Korski, one of the three Conservatives still in the contest to the party’s candidate for London mayor, has issued a statement describing as “baseless” the claim that he groped a TV producer when he was working in Downing Street 10 years ago. As Ben Quinn and Aubrey Allegretti report, the Conservative party has said it will not investigate the claim. Liz Kendall, the shadow social care minister, says Matt Hancock’s evidence to the Covid inquiry showed the Tories had “totally neglected” social care for 13 years. Matt Hancock admitted that the Conservatives have totally neglected social care for 13 years. If you don’t know how many care homes there are in the country you’re supposed to be governing, you can’t ensure people receive the care they need. His apology will provide little comfort to the 43,000 families who lost loved ones to Covid in care homes. Labour would ensure that adult social care is stabilised for the future, with record vacancies tackled through a new deal for care workers and a long-term plan of investment and reform, so that lessons are learned and society’s most vulnerable are never left so exposed again. In his evidence to the inquiry this morning Hancock said that before the pandemic the Department of Health and Social Care was lacking basic data about the sector. He went on: “For instance, how many care homes are operating right now in the UK – that was a fact that we did not know at that time and I’m glad to say now there’s far better data.” Hancock said that one problem was that, while he was in charge of social care policy as health and social care secretary, delivering social care was a matter for local authorities. At another point Hugo Keith KC, counsel for the inquiry, asked Hancock if he could say the adult social care sector was well prepared for a pandemic “when the department had no means of finding out whether or not they had the right plans in place, whether local authorities had planned sufficiently, let alone how many numbers were in the care sector.” Hancock replied: “No, it was terrible.” James Bethell is a close friend of Matt Hancock’s and served as a junior health minister in his department during Covid. He agrees with the main argument his former boss was making. (See 10.42am and 11.34am.) Keir Starmer has also claimed that some of the language used by Rishi Sunak about the cost of living crisis has been “extraordinary”. Speaking at the New Statesman’s Politics Live conference this morning, Starmer said: Some of the language he has used in the last week has been extraordinary: ‘I’m on it’, ‘Hold your nerve’, or recently telling the country to ‘understand the economic context’. The idea that people who are struggling every day do not understand the economic context they are in is, frankly, real evidence of how out of touch he is. Sunak urged people to hold their nerve in a tweet on Monday, and later the same day he said, with regard to the battle against inflation, he was “totally, 100% on it”. Talking about inflation, he has also repeatedly argued that this is a global problem, as he did at PMQs last week, and again in his interview with the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg at the weekend. At the New Statesman event, Starmer said he was not criticising Sunak for being wealthy. But he said his own working-class upbringing meant he had a better understanding than the PM did of what it means to struggle with the cost of living. He said: We holidayed here. We never went abroad. We didn’t really eat out very much. It’s not a sob story, it’s a story of what it’s like to grow up working class, but more importantly, it gave me an insight into respect and dignity. There were times where we couldn’t pay all the bills and we had to decide what we wouldn’t have any more… That is a feeling of anxiety but also shame, of not being able to do something. I don’t think [Sunak’s] been in that position. Zoë Grünewald at the New Statesman has a full write-up of what Starmer said here. Keir Starmer has refused to commit a future Labour government to always accepting recommendations from public sector pay bodies, PA Media reports. Speaking at the New Statesman’s Politics Live conference this morning, Starmer said Labour would have to “go at pace” to “repair and rebuild” the country’s finances but stressed that the “strong fiscal rules of the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, could not be broken when paying for public sector improvements, PA reports. Asked about his stance on public sector pay recommendations, Starmer said: The first thing about public sector pay is we need to understand why people want their wages to go up because, for most people, their wages haven’t gone up in material terms for 13 years. And if your wages haven’t gone up in material terms but every bill has gone up, there is a real squeeze on. The failure to grow the economy, and the additional damage that Liz Truss did, is the cause of that. But I’m not going to hide from this. If we are privileged enough to come into power at the next election … we’re going to inherit a real mess – a very badly damaged economy, public services that aren’t on their knees but are on their face, the NHS in particular. And a sense that we’ve got to go at pace to try and repair and rebuild, and run towards the future which is available for us as a country. And Rachel’s been clear that that will require us to have strong fiscal rules which we’re not going to break. But we urgently need to get on with the task now of picking the country up, rebuilding and moving forwards. At cabinet this morning the main discussion was about the NHS, and the long-term workforce plan being published later this week. In a readout of what was said, No 10 told journalists: As part of the government’s commitment to cut waiting lists and ensure the health service thrives for another 75 years, the prime minister said we would publish the first ever NHS Long Term Workforce Plan ahead of next week’s anniversary. He said the plan was not just simply about training more doctors and nurses, it would also set out how the NHS will retain more clinicians and reform how it works to match the areas of highest demand and learn from approaches in other countries. He said this plan was written by the NHS, it was what staff have called for and it was an example of the government doing the right thing for the long term – not just the here and now. Here is some Twitter comment on Matt Hancock’s evidence to the Covid inquiry. From Prof Devi Sridhar, professor of global public health at Edinburgh University From my colleague Peter Walker From Tom Harwood from GB News From my colleague John Crace From the journalist Isabel Oakeshott, an outspoken critic of lockdown policies Nurses in England have failed to vote in sufficient numbers for further strike action, Rachel Hall reports. Wetherby has finished. Hugo Keith KC gets up. He says the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group have sent an email on the basis of something Hancock said earlier. Hancock said Covid-19 was the first coronavirus that could be transmitted asymptomatically. Keith says the group have said that that was wrong, and that Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) and Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) could also be transmitted asymptomatically. Hancock does not contest this. But he says that the advice about coronavirus and asymptomatic transmission was vital to decisions taken early in the pandemic. And that’s it. His evidence is over. Pete Wetherby KC, counsel for Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, is now asking questions. He asks about various legal measures in place before the pandemic started. Hancock says he agrees with the general point, which is that the government should have been prepared for lockdown. This is from ITV’s Robert Peston, seems a reliable bet, based on the evidence already given to the inquiry. Keith is on his final question. Q: Why did no pandemic planning paper pay any attention to the impact of a pandemic on the vulnerable, on ethnic minority groups, or on other groups affected by health inequalities? No thought was given to the impact of measures on these groups. Hancock says, when he appointed Chris Whitty as chief medical officer, it was understanding that health inequalities would be at the top of his agenda. He says the medical impacts were covered by the plan. As for the social impacts, he says the assumption that you are not going to stop a pandemic implies the most vulnerable will be hit hardest. There are costs of lockdown. If the impact of a virus is going to be worse, you have to hit it hard, “and very, very early”. Q: No consideration was given to the needs of the most vulnerable. Hancock says consideration was given on a clinical basis, but not on a socioeconomic basis. Q: “Lions led by structural donkeys. Personally everyone gave their all, but the system was not fit for purpose.” Hancock says that is “absolutely right”. But he says that was a problem across the world, and it went back a long way. Hancock says no government would deploy its entire army on a single day. But, with health, the entire resources of the NHS are used every day. This means it does not have resilience in a crisis, he says. He says other countries, which spent more on health and have more capacity, are better prepared. But this would require a “huge increase in the already very, very large NHS budget”, he says. Hancock says the government started buying PPE in January 2020. But the problems with the stockpile were “very significant”, he says. He says this will be covered in more detail in the next module. He says there should be a legal requirement on health providers to hold a certain amount of PPE. Setting up supply chains in short order is very hard, he says. Keith mentions the need for mass diagnositic testing. “Yes, terrible,” says Hancock, in what seems to be a reference to the UK’s testing capacity. Keith mentions the need for mass contact tracing. Hancock accepts that there was “no such thing” in place. Hancock says, in the 18 months before the pandemic started, he was never asked to appear at that national security council to talk about pandemic planning. Q: Do you agree ministers need training in how to deal with civil contingencies? Yes, says Hancock. He says he was in the process of setting up a scheme for training like that, with the Blavatnik School of Government at Oxford, when Covid struck. But Covid meant that had to stop. Q: Do you think there should be a minister in sole charge of resilience, as Oliver Letwin recommended? Yes, says Hancock. He says they would not necessarily have to be in cabinet. But they would need to have the ear of the PM. He says the UK now has the UK Health Security Agency. He says the person in charge (currently Dame Jenny Harries) should wake up every morning worrying about the next pandemic. We now, once again, have a body whose sole responsibility is preparing Britain to be resilient to health external health threats. I want Jenny Harries and whoever’s in her job to wake up every morning worrying about the next pandemic and what needs to be put in place. You can of course supplement that with better resilience training at the centre as well. But you mustn’t take away from the real burning accountability of the person in that job. He says the UK spends £53bn on defence. But the budget for UKHSA is just £450m, even though more than 220,000 people died from Covid. That is less than 1% of the defence budget, he says. He says spending so little on the body in charge of pandemic planning is “completely indefensible”. Q: Was the planning for care homes complete to allow the surge capacity in hospitals to be completed? Hancock says the work was being done. But, as for whether it was complete, he says he will need to look at the paperwork. Hancock says he had to overrule advice telling him not to quarantine people arriving in the UK from Wuhan in China as the pandemic started. That was “madness”, he says. Hancock is repeating his point about the doctrinal failure. That failure was “colossal”, he says, and much more significant than the other flaws. Q: There was a systemic failure to think about how to prevent catastrophic consequences arising, as opposed to how to manage catastrophic consequences. Hancock replies: I could not agree more. And it is an absolute tragedy. Keith says he wants to draw some threads together. Q: Do you accept there was a bias in the department in favour of influenza, downplaying the risk of another disease? Hancock says it would have been better if the plans had been for a general respiratory disease. Q: Do you accept that the real risk of a coronavirus was not thought about because of this virus? Hancock says Covid-19 is the first known coronavirus that can be transmitted asymptomatically. A flu plan assumes asymptomatic transmission. So in some ways a flu plan would have been more suitable than a coronavirus plan, which would have assumed no asymptomatic transmission. But planning for flu had some benefits, he says. And, although this was the error, it was not the biggest problem. The flawed doctrine error (see 10.42am) was “significantly bigger” than the flu bias error. Hancock says adult social care “desperately needs reform”. But, again, he contests the claim that better planning for social care would have made a big difference in the pandemic. Keith is now showing Hancock a document showing how much work planned by the Pandemic Flu Readiness Board stopped at the end of 2018. He asks if Hancock was aware of this. Hancock says he was responsible, because he was responsible for everything that happened in the department as secretary of state. But he returns to his claim that, because the planning was flawed (see 10.42am and 11.34am), more planning might not have made much difference. Hancock said the UK came “within hours” of running out of medicines for intensive care during Covid. And he claimed the only reason this did not happen was because of the work done for a possible no-deal Brexit. He said: [The government came] extremely close, within hours, of running out of medicines for intensive care during that pandemic. It wasn’t widely reported at the time … and I think the only reason that we didn’t run out is because of the work that Steve Oldfield [chief commercial officer at the Department of Health and Social Care] and his team did, which they did during 2019, in preparation for a no-deal Brexit. Hancock said during Covid the government “knew more about the pharmaceutical supply chain in the UK than at any time in history”. This information was vital, and it meant “the difference between running out and not running out of drugs in intensive care in the pandemic”. He went on: So when it comes to the question of the overall impact of Brexit, absolutely the paperwork is very clear that some of the preparation work was stopped, and a small number of people would move off that work. On the other hand, we were better prepared in terms of supply chains. Keith is now showing Hancock a letter sent to Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, in March 2019 saying that responsibility for pandemic planning had transferred to his office because of the no-deal work being done within the Department of Health and Social Care. He says the letter shows that some pandemic planning was paused. That was a decision of great significance, wasn’t it? Hancock says it was a decision. But he does not accept it was “of great significance”. The number of individuals involved in this work was limited, he says. And he says, for the reasons he has explained earlier (see 10.42am and 11.34am), he is not convinced that extra pandemic planning, under the doctrine then in place, would have made that much difference. Back in the hearing Hugo Keith KC asks when Matt Hancock was briefied on the need for no-deal Brexit planning. Hancock says that discussion was ongoing. In the summer of 2019, resources were allocated to no-deal planning. But he says his team considered all threats. Isabel Oakeshott says that, in the year when she was working with Matt Hancock on his Pandemic Diaries, she never heard him make the argument that he is making today about the biggest flaw in government planning being its failure to prepare for lockdown measures that might have stopped the pandemic taking off. (See 10.42am and 11.34am.) But the Hancock argument does echo an argument raised by the counsel to the inquiry, Hugo Keith KC two weeks ago, in what may or may not have been a clue to the thinking of its chair, Heather Hallett. Going back to the Covid inquiry, Matt Hancock, the former health secretary, told it that, even if the UK had been hit by a flu pandemic (which it had prepared for thoroughly), there would have been problems because the planning was flawed. He said: My central point that to say that the main problem with that plan was that it was a flu plan and there was and we ended up with a coronavirus pandemic is, of course, a flaw, but it is not the central flaw. If we’d had a flu pandemic, we would have had a massive problem because of the doctrinal failure of how to respond to it as well – that was a much bigger error, it was an error across the western world, but it was a much bigger error and it is absolutely central. He argued that the key doctrinal flaw was the assumption that planning should focus on dealing with the outcome of a pandemic, not with preventing it. (See 10.42am.) He said the UK should be ready to implement policies like lockdown more quickly. It is central to what we must learn as a country that we’ve got to be ready to hit a pandemic hard: that we’ve got to be able to take action – lockdown action if necessary, that is wider, earlier, more stringent than feels comfortable at the time. And the failure to plan for that was a much bigger flaw in the strategy than the fact that it was targeted at the wrong disease … The doctrinal flaw was the biggest by a long way because if we’d had a flu pandemic, we still would have had the problem of no plan in place for lockdown, no prep for how to do one, no work on what, how best to lock down with the least damage. I understand deeply the consequences of lockdown and the negative consequences for many, many people – many of which persist to this day. A standards watchdog has said that Boris Johnson’s failure to comply with outside job rules before starting as a Daily Mail columnist shows how “out of date” the regulatory system in this area now is. Lord Pickles, the Tory peer who chairs the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), made the point in a letter to Oliver Dowden, the deputy prime minister, published today. Acoba advises on what second jobs it is appropriate for former ministers and former senior officials to accept soon after leaving government. The system is designed to avoid conflicts of interest. But its advice is not binding. In his letter to Dowden, who is in charge of the Cabinet Office, Pickles also suggested that corruption risks are not being monitored because the system is outdated. Pickles said: Mr Johnson’s role as a columnist for the Daily Mail was trailed by the media outlet in a front page pre-announcement of a new columnist on the morning of Friday 16 June. Mr Johnson later the same day confirmed his new role in a pre-recorded video on Twitter around 1pm, 30 minutes after submitting an application to Acoba for advice. This is a clear and unambiguous breach of the government’s rules and requirements of the ministerial code. Mr Johnson is familiar with both. He set out the standards expected in the ministerial code whilst prime minister and has had made previous applications under the rules, including a similar failure to follow the rules when he left ministerial office in 2018. The risks under the rules in media and journalistic appointments are usually regarded as limited and have been subject to a standard set of conditions preventing individuals from: drawing on privileged information; and lobbying the UK government. Mr Johnson’s case is a further illustration of how out of date the government’s business rules are. They were designed to offer guidance when “good chaps” could be relied on to observe the letter and the spirit of the rules. If it ever existed, that time has long passed and the contemporary world has outgrown the rules. This forces Acoba to spend time on low-risk applications at the expense of more complex and challenging cases. New areas of corruption are not monitored because they were not envisaged when the rules were drawn up. Pickles has also published his letter to Johnson saying he committed “a clear and unambiguous breach of the rules”. Matt Hancock has said that he thinks of those who died during Covid, and their loved ones left behind, every day. He made the comment in his witness statement to the inquiry. The statement has not been published in full, but an excerpt from it was shown on screen at the opening of the inquiry. In it Hancock said: There isn’t a day that goes by that I do not think about all those who lost their lives to this awful disease or the loved ones they have left behind. My office in parliament overlooks the National Memorial Covid Wall. I have visited the wall and been able to read about many of the families affected. I express my deepest sympathies to all those affected. Keith says the pandemic plan from 2011 did not get updated. Hancock confirms this. He confirms that preparing for a no-deal Brexit was a factor in this. But he defends the need for the government to do the no-deal planning. ITV’s Robert Peston has a screenshot of the document shown to the Covid inquiry earlier about planning for various risks. Alongside a flu or other pandemic, the mitigation boxes are empty. When asked about this, Hancock told the inquiry that, just because no plan was shown in this document, that does not mean no plan existed. Other documents shown to the inquiry confirm that plans were in place, he said. Keith asks Hancock why he did not ask officials where the antivirals (drugs) where for a non-flu pandemic, and where the stockpiles were for a non-flu pandemic? He says Hancock did not need a formal submission from civil servants to ask these questions. He says Hancock could have “pursued and harried [officials] until something was done”. Hancock says the pandemic was unprecedented. And he says that, as secretary of state, he had to address multiple problems. He says he was told that tackling problems like obesity were the main health challenges. Hancock expands on his belief that the UK’s pandemic planning was wrong. And he says this was a problem for other countries too. He says that is why is “emotionally committed” to the inquiry. It must get to the bottom of this “huge error in the doctrine”, he says. He goes on to apologise. I am profoundly sorry for the impact that it had, I’m profoundly sorry for each death that has occurred. And I also understand why, for some, it will be hard to take that apology from me. I understand that, I get it. But it is honest and heartfelt, and I’m not very good at talking about my emotions and how I feel. But that is honest and true. And all I can do is ensure that this inquiry gets to the bottom of it, and that for the future, we learn the right lessons, so that we stop a pandemic in its tracks much, much earlier. And that we have the systems in place ready to do that, because I’m worried that they’re being dismantled as we speak. Back at the Covid inquiry, Matt Hancock says he was told that the UK was well prepared for a pandemic. He was told the UK had PPE stored up. It did – but it was hard to access it quickly, he says. He was told they had the ability to do testing. They did, he said – but they were not able to scale up testing. He was told they had drugs available. They did, but they were only suitable for flu, he says. He says the UK had a doctrine on pandemic planning. And that doctrine was “wrong”. The absolutely central problem with the planning in the UK was that the doctrine was wrong. The attitude, the doctrine of the UK was to plan for the consequences of a disaster. Can we buy enough body bags? Where are we going to bury the dead? And that was completely wrong. Of course, it’s important to have that in case you fail to stop a pandemic, but central to pandemic planning needs to be – how do you stop the disaster from happening in the first place? How do you suppress the virus? The doctrine was about planning for the consequences of dealing with a pandemic, for example, being able to cope with large numbers of dead bodies, he says. He says the planning should have focused on avoiding a pandemic in the first place. (This echoes one of the arguments made by Keith himself, in his opening statement to the inquiry two weeks ago.) UPDATE: Hancock said: I was told that we have plans in these areas. So for instance, on stockpiles, I was told that we had a very significant stockpile of PPE. And we did. The problem was that it was extremely hard to get it out fast enough when the crisis hit. I was told that we were good at developing tests, and indeed we were. We developed a test in the first few days after the genetic code of Covid-19 was published. The problem was there was no plan in place to scale testing that we could execute. On antivirals, we had a stockpile of antivirals for a flu, but not for a coronavirus. On vaccines, I was concerned that we weren’t in a strong-enough position because we were reliant on manufacturing vaccines overseas. And I thought that in a pandemic scenario, force majeure would mean it would be hard to get hold of vaccine doses if they were physically manufactured overseas no matter what our contracts said. And so I insisted that we pushed on domestic manufacture and sought the funding to deliver on that. Four supermarket executives are giving evidence to the Commons business committee about claims they have been profiteering from rising prices. My colleague Graeme Wearden is covering the hearing on his business live blog. Hancock says a flu pandemic was category 1 risk because that was deemed the most likely pandemic. But of course the department was aware of the risk of other pandemics, he says. He says it was dealing with other diseases at the time. Keith shows Hancock a document about the briefing Hancock received on his first day in office. It included a briefing on global and public health. Q: There is no indication in this document about the level of risk from pandemic flu. Did you ask for more detail about that? Yes, says Hancock. He says he recalls reading the document that night, and specifically asking for more information. The journalist Isabel Oakeshott thinks Matt Hanock is giving a “typically assured” performance. Oakeshott, of course, is the journalist who helped Hancock produce his Pandemic Diaries, his account of handling the Covid crisis, before she betrayed his trust by leaking his private WhatsApp messages to the Daily Telegraph. She argued the revelations were in the public interest. Hancock says there was a potential flu outbreak during the autumn of 2019. There was also monkeypox, he says (it is now referred to as mpox), and the Ebola outbreak. For him, preparing for pandemics was not a theoretical exercise, he says. It was part of the job. Keith asks if the risk of a pandemic came up at the departmental board. Hancock says he does not remember that. But he would not expect the board to discuss that. The board was there to make sure the department was properly resourced. It was not there to do the planning itself. Hancock says, as health secretary, he covered many areas of importance. He says he would not say the NHS was the most important. Preparing for emergencies was part of the job, he says. Q: Were risks prioritised? Of course, says Hancock. That is vital. And he says, in a system like the health service, things have to be dealt with at the right level. Not everything can go to the secretary of state. He says the risk of a flu pandemic was a tier 1 risk. He was warned about this on his first day in office. The briefing covered pandemic flu, and other pandemics. He says on day one he asked for more information about preparedness. That was because he knew the importance of being prepared. Before he went into politics, when he worked at the Bank of England, he had experience of dealing with an emergency. Hugo Keith KC, lead counsel for the inquiry, is questioning Matt Hancock. Keith starts by saying Hancock was paymaster general and minister for the Cabinet Office between 2015 and 2016. He says that, in that capacity, Hancock was in charge of the national risk register. Hancock confirms that. But he says he was the junior minister. Oliver Letwin, his boss, was in charge, he says. Keith starts by stressing that today he will be asking about events that happened pre-pandemic. He is focusing on emergency preparations. So he will not be asking about matters like lockdown, or PPE. Those issues will be covered in later modules, particularly in module 2, which will run in the autumn, he says. Matt Hancock, the former health secretary, is about to start giving evidence to the Covid inquiry. He is the only witness scheduled for this morning, and so the hearing could run until about 1pm. At this stage the inquiry is just looking at how prepared the UK was for a pandemic, and so the evidence will focus on events before 2020. Hancock became health secretary in 2018. We will have a live feed at the top of the blog. Caroline Nokes, the Tory chair of the women and equalities committee, has been giving interviews about its report this morning. (See 9.13am.) Asked about the Home Office’s economic impact assessment of its illegal migration bill, she said it showed why the plan to deport migrants to Rwanda was “very difficult to justify”. Asked if the Rwanda policy represented value for money for the taxpayer, she told Sky News: No, I don’t think it does. I have always been concerned that the Rwanda scheme is not only very difficult to justify – why we should be sending asylum seekers to Rwanda to be processed within the Rwandan asylum system, when actually we should have better systems here? But the value for money question is a perfectly valid and legitimate one. And it’s worrying when the Home Office themselves can’t be certain that these figures are accurate, and they’re more predicated on the Rwandan scheme acting more as a deterrent and, to date, we’ve not seen it act as a deterrent. The Home Office has said it would only send unaccompanied child migrants to a third country in “very limited circumstances”. Responding to today’s report from the women and equalities committee (see 9.13am), a Home Office spokesperson said: Through the illegal migration bill, we will stop the boats by detaining those who come to the UK illegally and swiftly returning them to a safe third country or their home country. It is only right that we protect the most vulnerable by not creating incentives for criminal gangs to target specific groups. We have amended the bill to make clear that an unaccompanied child under 18 can only be removed in very limited circumstances. Where a removal decision is made, detention will be for the shortest possible time with necessary support provisions in place. Good morning. The illegal migration bill, and the government’s policy of sending asylum seekers to Rwanda (which the bill supports), is facing fresh criticism this morning. As Rajeev Syal reports, yesterday the Home Office published a report suggesting that, instead of sending people to Rwanda, it might be cheaper for the taxpayer to just let them stay. While the row about those conclusions continues, the Commons women and equalities committee has published a report saying that vulnerable people are particularly at risk from the government’s bill. The committee, which has a Conservative majority, says: The Nationality and Borders Act and illegal migration bill risk turning back the clock on policies intended to ensure immigration detention is used only as a last resort, and to reduce the risks of harm to vulnerable people. The government must set out how it intends to mitigate risks to vulnerable adults … A significant number of vulnerable people, to whom the removal process would very likely be harmful, have received notices of the Home Office’s intention to remove them to Rwanda. Notices of intent should be suspended, and no new notices issued until all legal challenges to the policy are complete. In particular, the committee says the government should rule out deporting migrant children to Rwanda. It says: The risks of harm to children arising from the removal process outweigh any risks of damaging the intended deterrent effect of the policy – the government should abandon any intention of forcibly removing children to Rwanda. Commenting on the report, Caroline Nokes, the Tory MP who chairs the committee, said in a statement: This inquiry took place in the context of an asylum system under immense strain, with increasing numbers of claims and a staggering increase in the backlog of people waiting for a decision on their case. We set out to understand the fairness of the UK asylum process, looking specifically through the lens of the UK Equality Act at the treatment of those with vulnerabilities arising from their protected characteristics. We were disturbed by the Home Office’s inadequate management of risks of harm to asylum seekers with protected characteristics, including women, LGBT people, children and disabled people. Alarmingly, these risks will increase under the Government’s recent and planned reforms. One of our biggest concerns is the treatment of children within the asylum system. Any intention to detain child asylum seekers under the Illegal Migration Bill and forcibly remove them to Rwanda must be abandoned. The risk of harm to children outweighs any perceived damage to the effectiveness of the Government’s policy agenda. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Keir Starmer takes part in a Q&amp;A at a New Statesman conference. Morning: Rishi Sunak chairs cabinet. 10am: Matt Hancock, health secretary from 2018 to 2021, gives evidence to the Covid inquiry. 10.10am: Executives from Sainsbury’s, Asda, Morrisons and Tesco give evidence to the Commons business committee about food price inflation. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.

      "politics\/2023\/jun\/27\/dutch-widower-told-to-leave-uk-after-home-office-visa-mix-up A widowed Dutch research scientist living in Britain with his British six-year-old daughter has had his skilled worker visa cancelled by the Home Office and received a notification that he needs to leave the UK within the next two months. Bobby Stuijfzand received a letter from the Home Office this month cancelling his visa. The letter said his entry clearance had been removed “because you have stopped working for your sponsor”, despite Stuijfzand still being employed by them. The notification added: “You do not have a right of appeal or administrative review against the decision to cancel your permission to stay.” Stuijfzand moved from Switzerland to England in 2021 after his English wife died from cancer, because he wanted his young daughter, who was born in Bristol, to be close to her British relatives. He was unable to apply for EU settled status – the immigration option for EU citizens after Brexit – because he was a few weeks short of accruing five years of residency when the family relocated to Switzerland in 2018. Instead he was granted a work visa when he moved back to the UK, sponsored by his employers, Behavioural Insights Team. He switched visa to a parental visa to be sure he could remain in the UK even if he needed to change jobs. However, the notification that his company was withdrawing visa sponsorship – because it was no longer necessary for them to sponsor him – appears to have led to the visa cancellation. Stuijfzand said he suspected an error had been made but it was not immediately clear how to alert the Home Office to their mistake. When he called the number on the letter it was answered by a computer saying it was no longer in use, he said. There was also a link to two long documents that did not make obvious how a complaint could be raised. He sent an email to the Home Office on Friday informing them that he believed they must have made a mistake. “My initial response was that it must be a scam because it was so unbelievable,” he said. He was dismayed by the accusatory tone of the letter, which warned him that if he stayed in the UK without permission he could be detained, prosecuted, fined and imprisoned, removed and banned from returning to the UK, banned from working, and could see his earnings seized and assets confiscated if he worked illegally, and his bank account frozen. He only realised it was a genuine letter when he verified that the Home Officer case number was correct. “I feel quite vulnerable raising my daughter as a single parent here. I felt the floor falling away from under my feet. I’ve worked incredibly hard to give my daughter an environment where she can grow up as a resilient girl … for that to be threatened by such arbitrary and very obscure process was a shock to the system,” he said. When the Guardian contacted the Home Office to ask about his case on Monday, an official said a mistake had been made and that Stuijfzand would be contacted. A Home Office spokesperson said: “Unfortunately a visa cancellation letter was issued to Dr Stuijfzand in error. We have issued a retraction and we apologise for any inconvenience this has caused him and his family.” Stuijfzand said he had paid about £8,000 in Home Office fees and NHS surcharge fees over the past two years. He was still waiting to hear confirmation directly from officials on Monday afternoon that his immigration status was not being cancelled. He said he was concerned that Home Office errors had a very alarming impact on recipients. “I can survive this but what happens to people who are more vulnerable?” he said. “If you don’t have the financial means or the support network to check this then you’re screwed.”\n",
      "politics\/live\/2023\/jun\/26\/rishi-sunak-nhs-health-keir-starmer-covid-inquiry-uk-politics-live The Home Office has published an economic impact of its illegal migration bill that says sending asylum seekers to Rwanda would cost £169,000 per person and would only save the taxpayer money if 37% of small boat arrivals were deterred. (See 5.09pm.) The report also shows how uncertain the government is about whether the policy will work. These are from Danny Shaw, the former BBC home affairs correspondent. It would be “impossible” for Britain to conduct a mass airlift of its nationals from Russia, but the UK government is planning for “all scenarios” after the country pulled back from the brink of civil war, the UK foreign secretary has said. Jeremy Hunt will ask industry regulators what they are doing about any companies exploiting rampant inflation by raising prices. The economic impact assessment for the illegal migration bill says that, in order to obtain value for money for the taxpayer (ie, for the financial savings to be higher than the financial losses), sending asylum seekers to Rwanda would have to have the effect of deterring at least 37% of people coming on small boats. The document includes a chart showing that, if the average time asylum claimants spend in accommodation waiting for their claim to be processed were to go up from four years to five years, the “break-even” deterrence rate would go down to 23% (because asylum seekers not deterred would become more expensive). But if the government were to get the average time spent waiting in accommodation down to just three years, the deterrence rate needed for the overall policy to be cost-effective would be 52%. Rishi Sunak is committed to reducing the asylum backlog. This analysis suggests that, in doing so, the government would make it harder for the Rwanda policy to be cost effective. In its press release marking the publication of the economic impact assessment into the illegal migration bill, the Home Office says the document shows that the taxpayer would save £106,000 for every migrant arriving in the UK illegally deterred by the legislation. It says the saving would be the same if, instead of being deterred from arriving, a migrant were sent to a third country. That figure is based on assumptions that 85% of arrivals need accommodation, accommodation costs £85 per person per night, and arrivals need accommodation for four years while asylum claims are processed. The £106,000 notional saving is lower than the notional cost of deporting an asylum seeker to Rwanda (£169,000 – see 5.09pm), but the Home Office says that, allowing for the pace at which accommodation costs are increasing, the estimated saving per migrant deterred rises to £165,000. This figure is much more convenient for the Home Office because it almost matches the £169,000 per head deportation figure, and largely counters the claim that, instead of sending people to Rwanda, it would be cheaper to let them stay. The £106,000\/£165,000 figures only cover accommodation costs. The economic impact assessment says there are other costs from having migrants in the country, and it says the average working-age adult costs the state £11,912 per year because they use government services. The document also argues that deterring illegal immigration would also bring other benefits not captured in these financial numbers, such as a reduction in migrant deaths, a reduction in illegal people smuggling, and a reduction in the number of unaccompanied child migrants going into care. Keir Starmer has said Labour views a free trade deal with India as “only the first step” towards building a wider “strategic partnership” with the country to bolster climate and global security, PA Media reports. PA says: The Labour leader said the UK must “step out of the shadows in its mind” in seeking to deepen bilateral ties with the modern republic. Speaking at the India Global Forum’s annual UK-India Week event in central London, which brings together politicians and business chiefs from both countries, Starmer said “resetting” the relationship with India would involve acknowledging shared values like “democracy of aspiration” between the two nations. “We share that ambition [of a free trade deal] but also a new strategic partnership for global security, for climate security, for economic security,” he said. “In this increasingly volatile world, on the collective security of defence cooperation between our two nations, absolutely, but also working together to support other nations which might come under external pressure.” He added: “The trade deal which I hope we can negotiate … we see that only as the first step in a strategic partnership that goes way beyond just the trade.” The Home Office has published the economic impact assessment for its illegal migration bill. It shows the government thinks it will cost £169,000 per person to send asylum seekers to Rwanda. In a written ministerial statement announcing the publication of the impact assessment, Suella Braverman, the home secretary, says that these costs must be considered alongside the benefits of irregular immigration being discouraged. She says: The economic impact assessment clearly shows that doing nothing is not an option, as the volumes and costs associated with illegal migration and the asylum system have risen significantly over recent years, driven by the rise in small boat arrivals. This increase of pressure on the UK asylum system, public sector spending, public service and accommodation capacity, and local communities, is unsustainable. That is why we are changing our laws and taking action to stop the boats. In 2022\/23, the current system cost the UK an estimated £3.6bn in asylum support costs alone and we are spending £6m a day on hotel accommodations. Unless we take action to stop the boats, these and other costs will continue to rise … The economic impact assessment forecasts a monetised benefit of over £100,000 for every illegal migrant deterred by the bill. The impact assessment also considers non monetised benefits that would result from stopping the boats, including: fewer individuals undertaking hazardous and unnecessary journeys crossing the Channel; reduced pressures on public services and housing markets; and other wider asylum system benefits from fewer migrants being supported in the system. She also says that, at current spending levels, the bill would need to deter 37% of arrivals to save money for the taxpayer. But if costs continued to rise, then by the end of 2026 a much lower deterrence rate would be cost effective, she says. The economic impact assessment estimates that - at current spending levels - the bill would need to deter 37% of arrivals to enable cost savings for the taxpayer. However, the costs of accommodating illegal migrants have increased dramatically since 2020. If these trends continue, by the end of 2026 the Home Office would be spending over £11bn a year (or over £32, a day) on asylum support. In such a scenario, the bill would only need to deter 2% of arrivals for the policy to enable cost savings for the taxpayer. In the Commons James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, is now making a statement about the events in Russia over the weekend. One of the first MPs to ask a question was Liz Truss, the former prime minister. Truss said there should be no letup in support for Ukraine, and she said its admission to Nato should be fast tracked. She also said there should be no talk of deals with Russia, or of sanctions being lifted, until the “war criminals” had been held to account. In reply, Cleverly said Truss was making “incredibly important” points. He said Ukraine’s record in the war showed why it should “ultimately” be a member of Nato. The war had “truncated” the period it should have to wait, he said. He said other allies thought the same. For the record, here is Labour’s five-point plan to help lenders that was announced on Wednesday last week. Their proposals were similar to those announced by the government on Friday, although Labour would require lenders to offer these options, whereas under the government’s plan lenders are agreeing voluntarily to make them available to customers. Labour said its plan involved: Requiring lenders to allow borrowers to switch to interest-only mortgage payments for a temporary period. Requiring lenders to allow borrowers to lengthen the term of their mortgage period. Requiring lenders to reverse any support measures when the borrower requests. Requiring lenders to wait a minimum of six months before initiating repossession proceedings. Instructing the FCA to urgently issue consumer guidance stating that borrowers making temporary switches to interest-only mortgage payments and lengthening the term of their mortgage period should not see their credit score affected. In his reply to Reeves, Hunt said that, although Labour is asking for mandatory measures, it opposed proposals in the financial services and markets bill to allow the government to make those plans mandatory. He also said under Labour’s plan lenders would have to wait six months before starting repossession proceedings. He said his plan went further, because it involved a 12-month delay. (See 3.53pm.) Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, responded to Hunt. She said that the government plan was inadequate because it was voluntary for lenders. Labour would require them to offer extra help to borrowers, she said. UPDATE: Reeves said: Our plan [see 4.05pm] would have provided real help, but government have provided just a bad cover version. While many banks and building societies are doing the right thing by their customers, a voluntary set of measures is just not good enough. The chancellor today said that the voluntary measures would cover 85% of the mortgage market. But what is his answer for the more than one million families who are missing out because their lender hasn’t signed up to this scheme? Tough luck. Just how bad does it have to get before the chancellor recognises that mandatory action is needed to provide meaningful assistance? Reeves also criticised Hunt for ignoring the plight of renters. Where is the plan for renters who the chancellor didn’t even mention in his statement today, many of whom are paying higher rents because the mortgage costs of their landlords have gone up? Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, is giving a statement to MPs about his “mortage charter”. He says that lenders responsible for 85% of lending have signed the charter, which is being published today. The key measures were announced on Friday, after Hunt’s meeting with bank bosses. There will be no repossessions within 12 months of the first missed payment, Hunt says. And customers having trouble paying their mortgages will be able to switch to an interest-only mortgage for six months, or to extend their mortage term so they can reduce their monthly payments. Labour has accused the government of failing to boost defence spending sufficiently following the invasion of Ukraine. During defence questions, the shadow defence secretary, John Healey, told Ben Wallace: He boasts about being the longest-serving Tory defence secretary, but in four years he has failed to halt this hollowing-out, he has failed to fix the broken procurement system, he has failed to win fresh funding this year even to cover inflation, and he has failed to stop service morale reaching record lows. Does he not see it as a national embarrassment for Britain to go to next month’s Nato summit as one of only five Nato nations that has not rebooted defence plans since President Putin invaded Ukraine? Wallace, the defence secretary, rejected Healey’s claim. He replied: When [Healey] talks about my record in defence, just look at defence procurement, because he is fond of coming to the dispatch box about that. In 2009 under Labour, 15% of projects coming out of the armed forces were over cost and the average delay was 28%. It is now 4% over cost and 15% of each project is delayed. That is value for money and at the same time we have got a real increase in the defence budget, and we have injected £29bn of additional funding. Lord Cooper of Windrush, a former adviser to various Conservative leaders who ended up as David Cameron’s director of strategy in No 10, is advising Keir Starmer, Rachel Sylvester reveals in her Times column. Cooper, who was seen as a Tory “moderniser” when they were a faction (it is hard to think of anyone in the party who would describe themselves in those terms now), was at school with Starmer, and as teenagers the two were in the East Surrey Young Socialists together. But Cooper is not just motivated by friendship; he left the Tories over Brexit, Sylvester reports, and wants Starmer to be PM. She reports: Cooper is not the only one who has climbed into Starmer’s rapidly expanding big tent. Nick Boles, the former Conservative minister, is backing Labour on the grounds that it is more “in touch with people’s everyday concerns”. Claire Perry, who served in Theresa May’s cabinet, left the Conservatives a few months ago criticising their “ideology and self-obsession” and praised Starmer’s “sober, fact-driven, competent political leadership”. Lord O’Neill of Gatley, the former Goldman Sachs banker who was a Treasury minister under George Osborne, has just completed a review on start-ups for Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor. Like Cooper he is a crossbench peer and therefore politically unaligned, but he told me: “Sensible people are coming together in the national interest.” Sylvester also says Cooper has told the Labour leader he needs to define himself more clearly. She says: In 2009, Cooper, who was at the time in charge of polling for the Tories, asked voters whether they thought it was “time for a change” from the Labour government. An overwhelming 75% said “yes”, but when he asked whether they thought it was time for a change to the Conservatives only 37% agreed. This was precisely the share of the vote that Cameron went on to secure at the general election the next year, denying the Conservatives an outright majority and forcing them into coalition with the Liberal Democrats. Cooper has just repeated the exercise for Starmer. Again, the polling found that the public has had enough of the incumbents – 79% thought it was time for a change from the Conservative government – but when Cooper asked whether they thought it was time for a change to Labour, just 37% agreed, exactly the same figure he found at a similar point leading up to the 2010 election. In 2009, he warned Cameron that he had failed to sufficiently detoxify the Tory party; now he is telling Starmer that he has still not adequately defined his positive pitch. There will be three statements in the Commons after 3.30pm: first Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, on the “mortgage charter” agreed with lenders on Friday; then James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, on events in Russia; and finally Steve Barclay, the health secretary, on a targeted lung cancer screening programme. Each statement lasts roughly an hour. The UK’s post-Brexit border strategy risks further pushing up food prices, according to a stark warning from representatives of Britain’s fresh produce industry. Joanna Partridge has the story here. Sharon Graham, general secretary of the Unite union, says that, by scheduling a meeting with regulators on Wednesday (see 12.44pm), the chancellor has in effect admitted that the UK is facing a “profiteering crisis”. But he is not doing enough about it, she said in a statement. Here we have a tacit acknowledgement from the chancellor that Britain is in the grip of a profiteering crisis. But to be honest, we need to go way beyond talking shops with regulators before we can be convinced the chancellor is serious about tackling Britain’s epidemic of profiteering. Tinkering at the edges is just not enough. Unite’s own research has shown that if domestic energy had been in public ownership at the time the crisis hit we could have saved every household £1,800 and cut inflation by 4%. Tinkering at the edges, and talking shops about the crisis are just not enough. At the Downing Street lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson made a point of stressing that there are rules against “profiteering” – although he also said he was not saying supermarkets were doing this. (See 12.44pm.) Downing Street has confirmed that it is going to ask regulators to consider what they can do to ensure any savings producers make get passed on to customers. At the lobby briefing, asked about Jeremy Hunt’s meeting with regulators on Wednesday, the prime minister’s spokesperson said the chancellor wanted to discuss what actions the regulators are taking, what more could be done to work together, and are there any potential barriers to them going further. The spokesperson said there was “no legal requirement” for supermarkets to pass on savings. But he went on: There are rules around things like profiteering – I’m not suggesting that’s the case here. Equally I think we would of course want supermarkets and others to rightly pass on the savings they are making with the fall in global energy costs. I think that’s what the public would expect and they will vote with their feet if that’s not the case. The spokesperson also said that, with interest rates going up, the government wanted to ensure that savers benefited. He said: We absolutely expect banks to pass through higher rates to savers, as they are for mortgage holders, and we’re working closely with the FCA [Financial Conduct Authority] who we know are monitoring it closely. It’s not only the right thing to do but it also has the potential to reduce inflation because people are encouraged to save rather than spend. Labour would prioritise devolution over abolishing the House of Lords, Thangam Debbonaire, the shadow leader of the Commons, has told the i in an interview. She described devolution, in the form of giving new powers to mayors and local authorities, as the priority constitutional reform “which will need to happen early on”. Keir Starmer has said these decentralisation measures will be in a “take back control” bill in Labour’s first king’s speech. Debbonaire also said Lords reform might initially focus on removing the remaining hereditary peers from the House of Lords. At the end of last year Labour published a report from the Commission on the UK’s Future, chaired by the former PM Gordon Brown, proposing various constitutional reforms, including abolition of the Lords and devolution of power away from Westminster. Starmer said he was committed to the recommendations. But he also stressed the importance of consultation, fuelling suspicions that abolition of the Lords (which is unpopular with Labour peers, and which previous Labour government has failed to achieve) may end up being ditched. In her interview, Debbonaire said the devolution plans would take priority. She explained: Constitutional legislation takes time and it drains energy. We’ve got a lot to do to fix a country where nothing works from getting a passport to fixing potholes. I do think the constitutional stuff which will need to happen early on is devolution because one of the ways we are going to deal with some of those problems is by devolving power to people who know what’s going on and have skin in the game … To be honest I would prefer we got on with the concrete business of trying to repair the country first – but Keir is committed to constitutional reform, it’s very much his thing, he’s backed what Gordon has said, and that is what we will do. But whether that comes in the first year, the second year, I don’t know at the moment. Debbonaire also said the “easiest” aspect of Lords reform would be removing the 92 hereditary peers remaining in the Commons. She said: I think the easiest thing on which there is the most consensus among the public and probably even their lordships is that hereditary principle [there are still 92 hereditary peers] is unsustainable. The 92 hereditaries were allowed to stay as part of a concession to peers offered by the last Labour government when it passed the House of Lords Act in 1999, which got rid of all other hereditary peers. In theory this was supposed to be a temporary arrangement that would only remain in place until full Lords reform was implemented. But further reform never happened. In his clip for broadcasters, Rishi Sunak reaffirmed his determination to take “responsible” decisions on public sector pay, even if that disappointed staff. He said: I think everyone can see the economic context that we’re in, with inflation higher than we’d like it, and it’s important that in that context the government makes the right and responsible decisions on things like public sector pay … People need to recognise the economic context we’re in and I’m going to make the decisions that are the right ones for the country. That’s not always easy. People may not like that, but those are the right things for everybody, that we get a grip of inflation, and that means the government not excessively borrowing too much money and being responsible with public sector pay settlements. That’s what I’m going to do. When it was put to Sunak that public sector pay was not pushing inflation up, he replied: Government borrowing is something that will make inflation worse. So the government has to make priorities and decisions about where best to target our resources. This is what Rishi Sunak said in his clip for broadcasters in response to claims that today’s King’s Fund report (see 9.28am) showed the NHS was going “in the wrong direction” under the Conservatives. He replied: One of the my five priorities is to count NHS waiting lists. That’s why we’ve put record sums into the NHS since I became prime minister, with record numbers of doctors, nurses, and new ways of doing things which are starting to make a difference. But we also need to make the decisions that will modernise the NHS for the long term. Today’s example, rolling out lung cancer screening, will really help improve survival rates for lung cancer, something where we are behind other countries, but today’s announcement will help to fix that. Also later this week we’ll be making a really important announcement. For the first time in its history, the NHS will have a long-term workforce plan to make sure that we hire the doctors, the nurses, and all the other GPs and medical staff that we need for the long term. Q: There is new evidence out today about the murder of Stephen Lawrence. Do you think the government needs to take action against the Met in the light of their failings in this case? Sunak says his thoughts are with Stephen Lawrence’s loved ones. He says this is an operational matter for the Met. They have said they are reviewing this. And that is the end of the Sunak broadcast clip. Sunak says it is too early to predict what will happen in Russia. But he is in close touch with allies, he says. Q: Is the UK prepared for the collapse of Putin? Sunak says the UK has been aware of the potential destabilising effect of the war on Putin’s regime for some time. It’s too early to predict with certainty what the consequences of this might be, but of course, as we always would be, for a range of scenarios. UPDATE: Sunak said: I’ve spoken to the leader of the United States, but also France and Germany over the weekend. It’s a situation that we’ve been monitoring for some time, in the instability that will be caused by Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine. And what we saw over this weekend as an example of that, coming to the fore, it’s obviously too early to predict with certainty what might happen as a result of this, but I’m in close touch with our allies and we’re monitoring the situation closely. Rishi Sunak has recorded a clip for broadcasters on a hospital visit to Nottingham. He said the targeted lung cancer screening programme announced today would save thousands of lives. Asked about the King’s Fund report, and whether the NHS is going “in the wrong direction”, he said he had made the NHS a priority since becoming PM. And he said another announcement later this week would give the NHS a long-term workforce plan. Q: Doctors and nurses are leaving the NHS to work abroad because they will get paid more. Why won’t you pay them more? Sunak says more than 1 million NHS workers accepted a pay offer from the government. It is “very disappointing” that junior doctors have not accepted their pay offer. He says he has got to take a responsible decision on pay. He says they have to control inflation. Q: Unions says public sector pay is not driving inflation up? Sunak says the government has got to control borrowing. It is important not to make the inflation situation worse, he says. Lord Bethell, a former health minister, has welcomed the announcement from the government today about targeted lung cancer screening. But he thinks the government should go further. The review by Javed Khan, published last summer, recommended raising the age at which people can buy cigarettes “by one year every year until no one can buy a tobacco product in this country”. Many Tories strongly oppose measures like this on libertarian grounds, and the government has not adopted the plan. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, has said that in principle he is in favour of Khan’s idea, but that he remains to be convinced that it is practical. In an interview recorded on Saturday with the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, Rishi Sunak said that public sector pay awards this year would be “affordable” and “responsible”, even if that “may not always be popular in the short-term”. On Sunday, in an interview with Sky News, John Glen, the chief secretary to the Treasury, signalled that this approach might involve ignoring recommendations from pay review bodies. Kiran Stacey has the story. This morning Helen Whately, the social care minister, was also asked if the government might refuse to implement in full recommendations from the pay review bodies. She told the Today programme: We are in the middle of considering some of the pay review bodies who have already reported back to us. Of course the government will … consider their recommendations and respond after doing that. Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, will ask industry regulators what they are doing about any companies exploiting rampant inflation by raising prices. Some Conservative MPs are cutting the amount of time they spend at Westminster so that they can concentrate on trying to defend their seats, Lucy Fisher reports in a front page story for the Financial Times. She reports: Conservative MPs defending marginals are able to apply for “slips” — permission to be away from the Commons — for up to one week each month to dedicate more time to campaigning in their home areas, and are being offered special help to try and improve their chances of re-election, several told the Financial Times … Members with low visibility have been told they “need to raise their local profile more” by acting like “glorified local councillors”, said one MP involved. They have been urged by the party machine to mail out hyperlocal, single-issue leaflets, engage more with local press and attend a higher number of constituency events. Fisher also quotes an anecdote, first used in the Sunday Times, about how Tories with majorities of under 15,000 have been told they are at risk. In their Sunday Times story yesterday, Caroline Wheeler and Harry Yorke said: Conservative MPs have also been privately briefed on the predicted electoral meltdown. Frank Luntz, the US pollster and former adviser to Boris Johnson, sounded the alarm last Wednesday during a Q&amp;A with the 1922 Committee of backbenchers. During his presentation, Luntz asked MPs present to put up their hands if they had majorities of 15,000 or less. “He said, ‘You’re likely gone,’” one attendee said. Luke Tryl, the UK director of More in Common, says that if Conservative MPs want to keep their jobs, they would do better focusing on making sure the government does its job properly. Helen Whately, the social care minister, was the voice of the government on the airwaves this morning and, when asked about the King’s Fund report (see 9.28am), she did not seek to contest its findings. On the Today programme, asked if she accepted that for many cancers, and for conditions such as strokes, outcomes in the UK were not as good as in many comparable countries, she did not challenge the premise of the question. Instead she replied: We know there are conditions and cancers, for example, and other major conditions like heart disease where, if only we could diagnose and pick these things up earlier, we can help people have much better outcomes. And that is one reason we are moving to a more integrated healthcare system, with areas across the country looking across whole populations to be able to intervene earlier and support people more preventively and [provide] earlier treatment. And on LBC, when it was put to her that the performance of the NHS was “shambolic” by international standards, she replied: One thing we are working on right now as a government is our major conditions strategy. It is looking at the big killers across the country, that includes cancer and heart disease, and coming forwards with the things we can do to really move the dial on how effectively we manage to prevent, diagnose and treat people with these conditions. Asked if the Conservatives were “failing on the NHS”, Whately replied: I will challenge that and one thing I would say is, on our commitment to bring down the waiting times, we have made real progress in bringing down some of the longer waits that have developed following the pandemic. Good morning. There are few institutions in the UK as loved and respected as the NHS. This is much discussed. But far less attention is given to a more unpalatable truth, which is that by international standards, the NHS is rather mediocre. It scores very well on equity (because it is funded by general taxation, and free at the point of use), but in terms of keeping people alive, it is “more of a laggard than a leader” on many measures, according to a report today from the King’s Fund, a health thinktank. The King’s Fund has compared health systems in 19 wealthy countries. Here is an extract from its summary. The UK has below-average health spending per person compared to peer countries. Health spending as a share of GDP (gross domestic product) was just below average in 2019 but rose to just above average in 2020 (the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, which of course had a significant impact on the UK’s economic performance and spending on health services). The UK lags behind other countries in its capital investment, and has substantially fewer key physical resources than many of its peers, including CT and MRI scanners and hospital beds. The UK has strikingly low levels of key clinical staff, including doctors and nurses, and is heavily reliant on foreign-trained staff. Remuneration for some clinical staff groups also appears to be less competitive in the UK than in peer countries … People in the UK receive relatively good protection from some of the catastrophic costs of falling ill. Relatively few core NHS services are charged for and certain population groups are exempt from charges. But financial protection is weaker for some services, such as dental care, and there is growing concern that people in the UK may be forced to choose between funding their own care or enduring longer waits for treatment. But the UK performs noticeably less well than its peers – and is more of a laggard than a leader – on many important measures of health status and health care outcomes. These include health outcomes that can be heavily affected by the actions of a health system (such as surviving cancer and treatable mortality), and outcomes such as life expectancy, which are significantly affected by factors beyond the direct control of any health system. Here is the full 120-page report. And here is my colleague Denis Campbell’s write-up. Rishi Sunak is doing a health-related visit today and he is likely to be asked about these findings. He is publicising a new lung cancer screening programme for England, targeted at people aged 55 to 74 with a history of smoking, and in a statement released overnight he admits the NHS faces “long-term challenges”. He says: We approach the 75th anniversary of the foundation of the NHS, I want to ensure that it continues to thrive for the next 75 years and beyond. And while we focus on cutting waiting lists in the short term, we must also look to tackle some of the long-term challenges facing the NHS, including lung cancer which costs 35,000 lives every year. Rolling out screening to high-risk 55-74 year olds will save lives by detecting up to 9,000 lung cancers a year at an early stage. Here is the agenda for the day. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 2pm: Dame Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, gives evidence to the Covid inquiry. 2.45pm: Keir Starmer speaks at the India Global Forum. After 3.30pm: MPs consider Lords amendments to the national security bill. 3.20pm: Peers consider Commons amendments to the retained EU law (revocation and reform) bill. It is the third time the bill has been sent back to the Lords, following its normal passage through both houses, because MPs and peers can’t agree on key issues. And Rishi Sunak is on a health-related visit in Nottingham today. If you want to contact me, do try the “send us a message” feature.

      "politics\/2023\/jun\/20\/chinese-couple-barred-from-uk-over-communist-party-donation-allegations A pair of wealthy Chinese nationals have been barred from entering the UK after the government accused them of being involved in making donations to British political figures on behalf of the Chinese Communist party. The married couple, both of whom had leave to remain in the UK, received the bans last year, but details of their exclusion have only now emerged in a case before a secretive immigration tribunal. A recent ruling in the case has revealed how the Home Office wrote to the individuals in March 2022, informing them that the home secretary at the time, Priti Patel, had personally ordered their exclusion. In letters sent to the couple, officials said their exclusion was “due to your involvement in providing financial donations to UK political figures on behalf of the Chinese Communist party (CCP). We therefore deem your presence in the UK is not conducive to the public good”. Extracts of the letters are included in the ruling by the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (Siac), a specialist tribunal that hears appeals by individuals removed or blocked from the UK on national security grounds. Specific details about the couple’s alleged involvement in UK politics or which political figures received donations linked to them are not referred to in the ruling. However, the judgment suggests they were clients of a law firm run by Christine Lee, a solicitor accused by MI5 last year of being a Chinese agent engaged in a covert campaign to influence UK politicians. According to the ruling, Christine Lee &amp; Co solicitors handled immigration applications made by the individuals, one of whom obtained a tier 1 investor visa in 2012 and later secured indefinite leave to remain in the UK. The couple, who cannot be identified due to an anonymity order made by Siac, frequently travelled to the UK and owned property in England. They were both overseas when the exclusion notices were issued. Siac’s ruling granted the individuals – identified by the commission as C17 and C18 – an extension to a deadline that allows them to appeal against their exclusion. The decision to refuse them entry to the UK was made under legislation allowing the government to exclude someone based on information it claims should not be made public, typically for national security reasons. The Home Office issued the exclusion notices two months after MI5 issued a rare security alert warning MPs of covert “political interference activities” in parliament on behalf of the CCP, the governing political party in China. In its alert, MI5 accused Lee, a well-connected figure in Westminster, of having “facilitated financial donations to serving and aspiring parliamentarians on behalf of foreign nationals based in Hong Kong and China”. China’s foreign ministry responded to the allegations at the time by insisting there was “no factual basis” for the claims against Lee. Its embassy in London criticised the alert, which it characterised as “smearing and intimidation against the Chinese community in the UK”. Siac made no reference in its recent ruling to any connection between the government’s allegations against the two barred Chinese nationals and the MI5 security warning. The Guardian has approached Lee and the law firm she founded for comment. The Home Office declined to comment.\n",
      "politics\/2023\/jun\/19\/unit-reforming-home-office-windrush-scandal-being-disbanded The Home Office unit responsible for reforming the department after the Windrush crisis has been quietly disbanded, after the UK home secretary, Suella Braverman, let it be known that she believes it is time to “move on”, the Guardian has learned. Staff working in the transformation directorate, the unit handling changes meant to prevent a repeat of the scandal, were told in an online meeting that it would be closing at the end of this month. Civil servants in two London-based teams within the directorate, working on the Home Office’s post-Windrush cleanup exercise have been told their work would be terminated on 1 July, sources said. Employees in a third team were told their work would no longer be led from the department’s London headquarters, and have been offered the chance to work with a Sheffield-based unit. Some Home Office staff have expressed concern that their work is being wound up before the promised commitments to reform the department have been completed. In the five years since the government first apologised for misclassifying thousands of Commonwealth-born people living legally in the UK as illegal immigrants, successive home secretaries have promised to oversee “comprehensive reform” of Home Office to ensure a similar scandal could never be repeated. Over the past six months, Braverman has been forced to acknowledge that she had dropped key commitments, which would have increased independent scrutiny of immigration policies. But the decision to disband the transformation directorate marks a more decisive move away from the post-Windrush reform agenda. Three teams within the directorate were working on post-Windrush issues – one on ethics, another on training and monitoring the progress on reform commitments, and a third on engagement with those affected by the scandal. Staff in the first two have been told their work is over; those in the engagement team have been told they can apply to merge with the Sheffield-based compensation team. Work to compensate those affected by the Windrush issues remains unaffected and continues. The cross-government working group on Windrush, which was set up to monitor progress on the reform agenda, has also been told it will disband after a final meeting this summer. Analysis published in February of progress towards meeting 30 agreed post-Windrush reform promises showed just eight had been met, 13 had been partially met and nine had not been met or dropped. Work was ongoing on assessing the effectiveness of “hostile environment” legislation (which requires immigration checks before people can access work, benefits and services). A commitment to identify victims proactively, particularly non-Caribbean people, was not complete. Among other things, a promise to improve the UK visa and immigration customer service was also not deemed to have been completed; work on ensuring civil servants highlighted to ministers how vulnerable people may be affected by new policies was also not finished. Some staff who were in the call expressed concern about the possible reputational damage to the Home Office of winding down this work. “They asked what advice had been given to ministers, and to stakeholders, and how it left our commitments to implementing the Windrush recommendations,” a source said, adding that the staff had not received a clear response. “The staff in those teams feel that the commitment is being watered down. People who work in the Windrush engagement team are unhappy about this.” The timing of the decision has also caused dismay among staff. This Thursday marks the 75th anniversary of the arrival of Empire Windrush in Britain and Buckingham Palace and Downing Street are preparing to host events. In the wake of the scandal, the government agreed to mark Windrush Day on 22 June as an annual celebration of the contribution of that generation of immigrants to the UK. Those affected by the scandal come from a much wider cohort of people than the descendants of those who arrived on the ship; people who arrived as children in the UK in the 1950s and 60s from India, Pakistan, the former UK colonies in Africa and elsewhere were affected. However, the scandal has been particularly associated with people who came from the Caribbean in the decades after the arrival of Empire Windrush in 1948. The transformation directorate, which is staffed by 20 to 30 people, was expanded a few years ago to make sure the recommendations made by Wendy Williams, the independent investigator who assessed the causes of the scandal, were embedded into Home Office culture. The department source said: “There’s a lot still to do to make sure we from what happened with Windrush particularly in the light of some of the illegal migration bill proposals. I’m worried that it signals of rolling back from the commitments that we publicly made about not repeating those mistakes. If there’s no team responsible for monitoring progress then the work won’t happen.” A Home Office spokesperson said the department would not comment on leaks, but added: “There have been and will continue to be team changes as the Windrush response is delivered. The government is honouring its Windrush commitments and providing support to those affected every day. Over £72m compensation has been paid or offered already and the scheme will stay open as long as needed.”\n",
      "politics\/2023\/jun\/18\/home-office-diversity-training-on-rise-despite-suella-braverman-scepticism The number of Home Office staff receiving diversity training has more than doubled under Suella Braverman’s leadership of the department, despite her assertions that such lessons are a waste of taxpayers’ money and should be banned. One month before she was promoted to home secretary in Liz Truss’s cabinet, Braverman, then attorney general, fiercely criticised equality sessions across Whitehall, revealing she had blocked officials at the Government Legal Department from attending such courses. But in the first six and a half months of Braverman’s leadership of the Home Office, the number of civil servants in the department receiving public sector equality training increased to 126 a month, from just over 80 a month under Braverman’s predecessor, Priti Patel. In response to a parliamentary question from the shadow attorney general, Emily Thornberry, the Home Office minister Chris Philp said 835 staff received the training between the start of September 2022 and mid-March. The training was one of the key recommendations made in 2020 by Wendy Williams in her Windrush Lessons Learned review, which outline the steps the Home Office needed to take in order to avoid any repeat of that scandal. Williams urged the department to launch a “structured programme of training and development for all immigration and policy officials and senior civil servants in relation to the Equality Act 2010 and the department’s public sector equality duty and obligations under the Human Rights Act 1998”, to which Patel wholly committed. The figures raise questions as to why the department’s commitment to this recommendation has accelerated under Braverman’s leadership while in January she ditched three other post-Windrush pledges made by Patel, including to create a post of migrants’ commissioner. A Westminster source said: “It looks like Braverman’s commitment to end diversity training means about as much as her vow to stop the small boats. It’s yet another reminder that the louder a minister in this government shouts about an issue, the less they actually deliver.” Last August, Braverman backed the then Tory leadership contender Truss’s proposals to scrap diversity and inclusion roles across Whitehall. Braverman said she was “all for a diverse workforce … meritocracy [and] inclusion” but there had been a “takeover by HR teams, campaign groups” that had “propagated a political ideology when it comes to identity politics”. Describing “thousands of hours” of diversity and inclusion training in government departments as a “huge cost to the taxpayer”, Braverman said: “It’s been divisive not inclusive. It’s been patronising, not empowering. It’s based on an assumption that me as an ethnic Asian woman from working-class roots must be a victim, necessarily oppressed. “That’s a misassumption. And I think it creates division. It’s tearing up society, breaking down the fabric of our country. And I think it’s a waste of money.” After the government’s decision to drop key Windrush commitments, Williams said it felt like a “slap in the face”. Her comments were echoed by others such as the campaigner Patrick Vernon, who accused the home secretary of “backsliding” on promises to set things right. The Guardian understands that the 69% of Home Office staff who work in operational roles including migration and borders and homeland security will be required to undertake online equality training later this year. A Home Office spokesperson said its staff “are required to undertake regular learning and development across a range of topics”.\n",
      "politics\/2023\/jun\/17\/norwegian-roxy-music-album-cover-star-kari-ann-moller-fights-to-stay-in-uk-post-brexit As a result of Brexit, Norwegians living in the UK were required to apply to the EU settlement scheme – despite Norway not being a member state – to remain living in Britain. But after former model turned yoga teacher Kari-Ann Moller was stopped by British immigration officials earlier this year and told she was not allowed to remain because of her Norwegian passport, her husband, Chris Jagger – brother of Rolling Stone Sir Mick – got involved. Writing in the Times, he said he had uploaded a picture of Roxy Music’s 1972 album – on which she appears, dressed in satin frills, on the cover – to support his wife, who has lived in the UK for 74 years, in her application. “Sir, My wife, Kari-Ann, who is Norwegian, has lived in the UK for 74 years but is now being asked to apply to the EU settlement scheme, so to support her application I have uploaded a picture of Roxy Music’s 1972 debut album, Roxy Music, as she is featured on the cover,” he wrote. “I wonder if this is admissible evidence? Chris Jagger, Mudgley, Somerset.” Usually acceptable documents include bank statements, council tax bills, electricity bills and GP appointment cards. As well as appearing on Roxy Music’s debut album, Moller, who is now known as Jagger, also featured on the cover of Mott the Hoople’s 1974 album The Hoople and briefly in the 1967 film Casino Royale. She told the newspaper she had been asked to supply “further information” to support her claim. “The whole thing is an absolute nightmare,” she told the Times. “There is a risk that I may not be able to come back in if I go away. It is crazy because I don’t even speak Norwegian.” Jagger, who was born in Arendal, in south-east Norway, in 1947, to a Norwegian airman and a British mother who took her to live in Cornwall. When she was 17 she urgently needed a passport to go on a modelling assignment in New York for Mary Quant and found the fastest way to do so was to get a temporary passport from the Norwegian embassy before later getting a full passport. She married her husband 44 years ago. Between them they have five sons aged between 38 and 50 – three of whom are from their previous marriages and two together – and 14 grandchildren and live in Somerset. She was stopped by an immigration official when she arrived at Bristol airport in March from Madeira, who asked her how long she had lived in Britain. When she told him 74 years, he reportedly told her that there was nothing to show that she lived in the UK at all. After an hour she was reportedly released and told that she could remain for three months and that she could apply for EU settled status. “The three months are up now,” she told the Times. “I don’t know if I can go out of the country and see my aunt in Norway.” “Brexit – the whole thing is a disaster”, Jagger, who is also a musician, said. “You’ve got a government department spending time and money on dealing with this nonsense. I just wonder how many other people are in a difficult situation like this.” The application process, he said, had so far taken him eight hours. “I uploaded her earlier Norwegian passports and as a bit of a joke I uploaded the Roxy Music cover.” The Home Office has been contacted for comment. A Home Office official said: “Border Force officers routinely carry out passport checks on passengers arriving in the UK. We are in contact with Ms Jagger and assisting her.”\n",
      "politics\/live\/2023\/jun\/15\/boris-johnson-partygate-privileges-committee-report-conservatives-uk-politics-live Boris Johnson deliberately misled parliament over Partygate and was part of a campaign to abuse and intimidate MPs investigating him, a long-awaited report by the privileges committee has found. In an analysis of what the report means for Johnson, Pippa Crerar writes: It has long been Johnson’s instinct when faced with trouble to double down, deflect, deny – and to attack. It is why he is claiming that the committee report with its “trumped up” charges has dealt the “final knife-thrust in a protracted political assassination”. He still cannot see that his response throughout to the Partygate affair has made his situation worse. It could have turned out very differently for Johnson, for the Tory party and for the country, if he had accepted responsibility from the start. But that would go against every one of his instincts. He has run head first into reality and found himself out of frontline politics, out of parliament and out of favour. And while it is always unwise to write off Johnson, his chances of once again staging a frontline political comeback now look vanishingly remote. Pippa’s full analysis is here. Boris Johnson’s supporters have reacted with fury to the privileges committee’s finding that he misled parliament, with some making open threats that Tories who vote to endorse the report could face deselection by their members. And here is Peter Walker’s summary of what the report says. In its report the privileges committee says Boris Johnson could be the subject of a fresh inquiry if it turns out that he submitted WhatsApp messages to the Covid inquiry that he withheld from Harriet Harman and her colleagues. In what was interpreted as a bid to embarrass Rishi Sunak and No 10, who are resisting demands from the Covid inquiry for it to get access to unredacted WhatsApp messages from minister if No 10 thinks they are irrelevant, Johnson told the Covid inquiry it could see all his messages. In its report, the privilges committee says it only received “a limited number” of WhatsApp messages from Johnson. In a footnote it goes on: We note that Mr Johnson has recently undertaken to supply the Covid public inquiry with a large number of his personal WhatsApp messages. This contrasts with his highly restrictive release of such messages to us. If it transpires from examination of the WhatsApp messages supplied to the Covid inquiry that there was relevant material which should have been disclosed to us either by Mr Johnson or the Cabinet Office, this would be a serious matter which the House might need to revisit. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group says Boris Johnson should never be allowed to stand for public office again. Its spokesperson David Garfinkel said in a statement: This is another grim reminder that whilst families like mine were saying goodbye to our loved ones over Zoom, the same prime minister that failed us so badly in the first place was breaking his own rules so he could have a party and a laugh. Johnson has shown no remorse. Instead he lied to our faces when he told us that he’d done ‘all he could’ to protect our loved ones. He lied again when he said the rules hadn’t been broken in Number 10, and he’s lied ever since when he’s denied it again and again. It’s an utter tragedy that Johnson was in charge when the pandemic struck and he should never be allowed to stand for any form of public office again. His fall from grace must serve as a lesson to other politicians to act with honesty and to serve the public as a whole – that is the only positive that can come from this. Twenty per cent of people think Boris Johnson did not get a fair hearing from the privileges committee, a YouGov poll suggests. Almost half of voters think he did get a fair hearing, and the rest don’t know. Among Conservative supporters, 40% think he did not get a fair hearing, the poll suggests. The poll also suggests that the notional 90-day suspension proposed by the committee is seen as not harsh enough by three time as many people (45%) as the number seeing it as too harsh (15%). In an interim report published in March, the Commons privileges committee said that its inquiry would focus on whether Boris Johnson misled parliament over Partygate and, if so, whether “that was inadvertent, reckless or intentional”. After Johnson gave evidence in person, it was obvious that the committee would conclude, at the very least, that Johnson misled MPs by being reckless. But it was much less clear whether it would conclude he did so intentionally, because to prove someone lied, it is necessary to know what they were thinking, and whether they knew they were saying something untrue. Dominic Cummings (see 7.47am) and others have said Johnson does not really distinguish between truth and lies anyway. Donald Trump is much the same. But the committee has concluded that Johnson deliberately misled MPs. Here are some of the arguments it makes to defend this conclusion in its report today. Johnson must have known his interpretation of what was allowed under the Covid guidelines was false, the committee says. In paragraph 117 on page 36, it says: We think it highly unlikely on the balance of probabilities that Mr Johnson, in the light of his cumulative direct personal experience of these events, and his familiarity with the rules and guidance as their most prominent public promoter, could have genuinely believed at the time of his statements to the house that the rules or guidance were being complied with. We think it just as unlikely he could have continued to believe this at the time of his evidence to our committee. We conclude that when he told the house and this committee that the rules and guidance were being complied with, his own knowledge was such that he deliberately misled the house and this committee. Johnson’s is now misrepresenting the significance of what he said in the Commons, the committee says. In paragraphs 181, 182 and 183, starting on page 52, it says: The problem with Mr Johnson’s attempts to portray his assertions to the house [that the rules were followed in No 10] as narrow in scope is that this interpretation is directly at odds with the overall impression members of the house, the media and the public received at the time from Mr Johnson’s responses at PMQs … The impression the house would have taken and, we conclude, would have been intended to take, from Mr Johnson’s repeated references to assurances was that those assurances had been overarching and comprehensive, and to be given great weight. In fact, as we have seen, the only assurances that we can be certain were given to Mr Johnson were arrived at in haste based on a press “line to take”, were not subject to investigation before either session of PMQs, and did not emanate from senior permanent civil servants or government lawyers but from two media advisers and were based only on their personal recollections. Although Mr Johnson claimed several times to have been given the assurances “repeatedly”, in evidence to us he scaled down that claim by arguing that by “repeatedly” he had meant “on more than one occasion” (so possibly only twice). Mr Johnson’s attempt in his evidence to us to claim that his assertions at PMQs were narrow in scope amounts to ex post facto justification and was clearly not the message he intended to convey at the time. As an ex post facto justification, it is false. Johnson was so reckless as to whether the truth was being told that this amounted to being deliberately misleading, the committee says. In paragraph 201 on page 59, it says: His personal knowledge of breaches of the rules and guidance, combined with his repeated failures pro-actively to investigate and seek authoritative assurances as to compliance issues, amount to a deliberate closing of his mind or at least reckless behaviour. We find it highly unlikely that Mr Johnson having given any reflection to these matters could himself have believed the assertions he made to the house at the time when he was making them, still less that he could continue to believe them to this day. Someone who is repeatedly reckless and continues to deny that which is patent is a person whose conduct is sufficient to demonstrate intent. Many aspects of Mr Johnson’s defence are not credible: taken together, they form sufficient basis for a conclusion that he intended to mislead. It is generally assumed that there will be a division on Monday after MPs debate a motion to approve the privileges committee report. Reports like this normally go through on the nod, but some Conservative MPs have already said or indicated they are going to vote against. (See 1.44pm.) At the end of a debate, the speaker calls a vote by acclamation (“all those in favour, say aye”), and all it takes is one or two MPs to shout “no” loudly enough for a division to be called. But, in an interview with Radio 4’s the World at One, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Boris Johnson supporter and former business secretary, suggested that a division may not in fact take place. Any vote would be a “formality”, he said, because “a small number of Tory Boris haters” would vote with the opposition. But he also said: “It may not come to a vote.” Given the pressure on Tory MPs to vote against the report (see 11.32am), it would be surprising if the Johnsonites did not force a vote. And yet, any division might just show how few supporters Johnson has in the parliamentary party. Most Tory MPs would probably choose not to vote at all, but the motion would get through with opposition backing. Just as Johnson decided to walk way from the privileges committee process last week, his supporters could decide to boycott the Commons vote on the supposed grounds it was “unfair”. And it would suit the Tory whips for no division to take place, because that would prevent endless rows breaking out in Conservative associations over whether MPs voted for or against. The debate is the main business scheduled for Monday. But on Mondays the Commons does not start sitting until 2.30pm, and any debate would not start until 3.30pm at the earliest. From the government’s point of view, the less attention it gets the better, and so it would not be surprising if some lengthy and dull ministerial statements gets scheduled for Monday, and perhaps some urgent questions too, pushing the start of the debate back by a couple of hours or so. The byelections in Uxbridge and South Ruislip, Boris Johnson’s constituency, and in Selby and Ainsty, Nigel Adams’s constituency, will take place on Thursday 20 July, the Telegraph’s Christopher Hope reports. One of the oldest cliches about Boris Johnson is that it is never safe to rule out his making a comeback. The polling firm Savanta has published the results of a snap poll today that suggests, following the publication of the privileges commtitee’s report, almost half of voters think his political career is over. But 40% of people do not agree, the poll suggests. And more than half of people who voted Tory in 2019 don’t think his career is over, according to the survey. The Commons privileges committee report makes it clear that it is being particularly harsh towards Boris Johnson because of the way he responded to its inquiry. In a list of five reasons justifying the proposed 90-day suspension, if he had remained an MP, only one relates to what he orginally told MPs about Partygate, three relate to his response to the investigation, and one relates to what he told the committee when he gave evidence to it. (See 9.18am.) The committee says that attacks on its integrity amount to contempt of parliament, and that Johnson is an offender in this regard. It says: [Johnson] stated that the committee had “forced him out […] anti-democratically”. This attack on a committee carrying out its remit from the democratically elected house itself amounts to an attack on our democratic institutions. We consider that these statements are completely unacceptable. In our view this conduct, together with the egregious breach of confidentiality, is a serious further contempt. The committee criticises Johnson for, among other things, calling it a “kangaroo court”. It does not criticise other MPs who have used similar language, but it says it is going to address this matter in a further report. In paragraph 14 it says: From the outset of this inquiry there has been a sustained attempt, seemingly coordinated, to undermine the committee’s credibility and, more worryingly, that of those members serving on it. The committee is concerned that if these behaviours go unchallenged, it will be impossible for the house to establish such a committee to conduct sensitive and important inquiries in the future. The house must have a committee to defend its rights and privileges, and it must protect members of the house doing that duty from formal or informal attack or undermining designed to deter and prevent them from doing that duty. We will be making a special report separately to the house dealing with these matters. The committee does not say it will be naming other offenders in this regard, and proposing sanctions. But that might be an option for the committee. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former business secretary, is one of the most prominent MPs who has denigrated the committee in this way. Although his language today has been more moderate, in the past he has described the committee as a kangaroo court, and on the day it took evidence from Johnson he posted a joke tweet making the same point. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, says that Boris Johnson is a liar, and that Rishi Sunak should call an early general election. At Holyrood Humza Yousaf accused Boris Johnson of “betraying the people of the UK” during first minister’s questions. During questions about delays to road improvements across the Highlands, Yousaf accused Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross of trying to “dodge” the scandal. Yousaf said Johnson was “not just lying to the House of Commons, but betraying the people of this country and of the UK”. He went on: When they couldn’t visit a loved one, when they couldn’t attend funerals of loved ones, Boris Johnson was breaking the rules and having parties in Number 10. Yousaf said that Ross “backed Boris Johnson to the very hilt” and later called on the Scottish Conservatives to apologise for backing Johnson and for all their MPs to vote for the report when it’s brought to the Commons. Speaking to media after FMQs, Ross said the report was “significant” and “very thorough”. Ross was one of the first senior Tories to call for Johnson to quit in the wake of the revelations, but later revised his position after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. He said he would support the committee’s recommendations and called on fellow MPs to accept that the committee was doing the job asked of them. He said: Not everyone will agree with the outcome of their deliberations but it was the parliament as a whole who asked for this. Any MP found to have deliberately misled parliament is guilty of a grave incident and for a former prime minister that is even worse. Ross also described Johnson’s behaviour in presiding over parties while people were dying and unable to visit sick relatives as “unforgivable”. The privileges committee’s findings on Boris Johnson “is in danger of making the House of Commons look foolish”, the former business secretary Jacob Rees Mogg has said. In an interview with GB News, the Johnson ultra-loyalist slammed the inquiry’s report, which he said contained “no real sanction”, while its recommendation that Johnson be suspended for 90 days was “merely trying to make a point”. Rees-Mogg said the report had failed to address Johnson’s allegations that “most of the members of the committee” had already expressed deeply prejudiced remarks about the former prime minister’s guilt before they had seen the evidence and they should have recused themselves. He said: Chris Bryant behaved absolutely properly and recused himself [from the committee’s investigation] because he had prejudged it. Harriet Harman did not and the problem with that is that the chairman of committees is extremely influential and important. The first draft that goes to the committee to vote on is prepared by the chairman of the committee and that level of power or authority of influence is one that needs to be exercised by somebody who has not judged the case before the committee. And I think this is a fundamental flaw, which undermines all the work of the committee. I think if you look back over the history of parliament, parliament sometimes makes great mistakes when it tries to stand on its dignity. I think that this report is in danger of making the House of Commons look foolish. Rees-Mogg was referring to some tweets posted by Harman in April 2022, including one in which she commented, seemingly approvingly, on an Alastair Campbell tweet saying Johnson and other ministers lied repeatedly about Partygate. Another question from a reader. I note that in the minutes it was a 2-4 split on whether the committee would recommend Boris Johnson be expelled from the house. If that had gone the other way, would that be the harshest sanction placed on an MP in modern times? It depends how you define modern. The last MP expelled from the Commons was Garry Allighan, a Labour MP who was expelled in 1947 because he had sold information about private Labour meetings to journalists, and then lied about it, and blamed others, when investigated by the privileges committee. Boris Johnson’s supporters in the parliamentary Conservative party have been speaking out against the privileges committee’s report. They are a minority in parliament – a very small minority now, it appears – but they have not gone quiet. Here are some of their comments. Nadine Dorries, the former culture secretary, says any MP who votes for the report is “fundamentally not a Conservative” and will be at risk of deselection. This report has overreached and revealed it’s true pre determined intentions. It’s quite bizarre. Harman declared her position before it began. Jenkins, the most senior MP on committee attended an ACTUAL party. Any Conservative MP who would vote for this report is fundamentally not a Conservative and will be held to account by members and the public. Deselections may follow. It’s serious. MPs will now have to show this committee what real justice looks like and how it’s done. And here are some more comments from Johnson allies. From Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former business secretary: I think [the committee] have come to conclusions that are not fully supported by the evidence. I think their fundamental judgment is wrong because I don’t think he deliberately misled parliament. From Simon Clarke, the former levelling up secretary: From Brendan Clarke-Smith: From Paul Bristow: From Mark Jenkinson Here is a question from a reader. Is the privileges committee unanimous in its findings? i.e. Did all the Tory MPs on the committee agree with the non-Tory? Is it a requirement that all MPs on a committee should agree with the final outcomes\/opinions? There are seven MPs on the committee and none of them have dissented from the report, and so in that sense it is unanimous. But, as the minutes reveal (on page 103 of the report), at a meeting on Tuesday, where the final version was agreed, the SNP MP Allan Dorans proposed an amendment to the final paragraph. Instead of it saying that if Johnson were still an MP they would be recommending a 90-day suspension, he wanted it to say that if Johnson were still an MP, they would be recommending his expulsion from the Commons. In a vote on the amendment, the Labour MP Yvonne Fovargue also backed the idea. But they were outvoted by the four Tories on the committee, Andy Carter, Alberto Costa, Sir Bernard Jenkin and Sir Charles Walker, who stuck with the 90-day proposals. Harriet Harman, the Labour chair, did not vote (which is normal practice for a committee chair, unless a vote is tied). Downing Street has rejected call’s for Boris Johnson’s honours list to be rescinded in the light of the privileges committee’s report. Asked about this proposals, the PM’s spokesperson told journalists at the morning lobby briefing: When it comes to honours, that’s a longstanding convention. The prime minister has abided by convention, that’s not going to change. The spokesperson also said there were “no plans” either to force Johnson to repay the money spent by the government on his legal advice during the privileges inquiry (the Labour proposal – see 11am) or to remove his allowance as an ex-PM (the Lib Dem proposal – see 10.06am.) On the allowance, the spokesperson said: These arrangements are fairly longstanding – it’s not a personal salary or allowance, it’s the reimbursement of expenses for office and secretarial costs. The Commons vote on the privileges committee report on Boris Johnson will take place on his birthday, Michael Savage from the Observer reports. He will be 59. Downing Street won’t say whether Rishi Sunak will be in the Commons on Monday for the vote on the privileges committee report, John Stevens from the Mirror reports. He suspects Sunak might discover a diary appointment elsewhere. Alongside its main report, the privileges committee has this morning published a short document with additional evidence and material, not previously published, that it relied upon when coming to its conclusions. The new material includes this written submission from a No 10 official who explains how Covid guidance was regularly ignored in Downing Street in 2020. There was a culture of “not adhering to any rules”, they say. Staff were even warned, before they went outside the front door, not to go outside in groups because outside No 10 they would be expected to observe social distancing. The privileges committee report does not actually say that Boris Johnson “lied” to MPs. But it says he “deliberately misled” MPs (see 9.13am), which would match the definition of lying to most of us. But Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, has used the term. She told the BBC: Boris Johnson is not only a law breaker but he’s a liar … He needs to apologise for what he’s put the public through – he won’t though because Boris Johnson never accepts responsibility for what he does. Harry Cole, the political editor of the Sun, has also spoken to a “senior Tory” who thinks colleagues who vote for the privileges committee report risk being deselected. Speaking to MPs during questions on next week’s business, Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, said MPs should not be subject to pressure ahead of Monday’s vote. My advice to all [MPs] is, having had the committee carry out the work we asked them to do, is to read the report, is to make their own judgments about it, and take the task that is our privilege to do seriously and soberly. And members should use their own judgment on that. I can confirm that the motion before us will be votable, it will be amendable, and it is house business, and so I am expecting a free vote. And I know also … these are difficult matters for the house. We have to look at the evidence, we have to look at the report. But we are talking about people who are friends and colleagues. It will be a painful process and a sad process for all of us, the tasks that we face on Monday. But all of us must do what we think is right, and others must leave us alone to do so. Mordaunt was referring to supporters of Boris Johnson who are denouncing the privileges committee report on social media and some of whom seem to be suggesting that Tory MPs who back the report could be subject to deselection. This is from David Campbell Bannerman, a former Tory MEP who now chairs the Conservative Democratic Organisation, a new group pushing for more grassroots democracy in the party. It is widely seen as a closet “bring back Johnson” campaign. Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, has told MPs that there will be a free vote on the privileges committee’s report. The motion (to accept the report, and its recommendations) will be amendable, and it will be the main business on Monday. Labour says Rishi Sunak must give MPs the chance to approve the privileges committee report. The shadow leader of the Commons, Thangam Debbonaire, has issued this statement. The evidence in this report is damning and the conclusions the committee came to are clear. Boris Johnson is a lawbreaker and a liar. Rishi Sunak must now confirm the government will follow precedent and give the house the opportunity to approve the report and endorse the sanctions in full. Rishi Sunak’s weakness means he has never stood up to Boris Johnson. This report makes it even more inconceivable that the prime minister approved Boris Johnson’s resignation honours list just a week ago, as part of some sort of grubby deal rather than waiting for this report and saying ‘no’ to his former boss. Sunak has already indicated that MPs will get a vote. (See 8.13am.) We should get confirmation when we get the statement on next week’s business in the Commons, in the next few minutes. Debbonaire said Johnson should also be asked to repay the £245,000 of taxpayers’s money spent funding his legal support during the inquiry. She said: Rishi Sunak is so out of touch he thought it was right that taxpayers’ hard-earned money fund Boris Johnson’s ongoing lies to the public. Given the findings of the committee, Rishi Sunak should demand Boris Johnson pays back every penny. My colleague Henry Dyer says there are two other examples of MPs being told they should be suspended for more than 90 days in recent times. (See 10.17am.) In 2012 the Commons standards and privileges committee said Labour’s Denis MacShane should be suspended for 12 months for falsifying his expenses, but he resigned as an MP before the Commons approved the punishment. And in 2014 Patrick Mercer, a Conservative, resigned as an MP after the Commons ruled he should be suspended for six months for lobbying. Labour’s Keith Vaz also faced a six-month suspension. But he did not serve this in full because an election was called soon after the punishment was imposed, and he stood down. The SNP says the privileges committee report is damning not just for Boris Johnson, but for the whole Conservative government. In a statement Mhairi Black, the SNP’s deputy leader at Westminster, said: This report is utterly damning for Boris Johnson and this arrogant Tory government, and it underlines why Scotland needs to escape Westminster control with independence. Johnson may have left parliament but his toxic legacy continues - with yet another out-of-touch Tory prime minister imposing Brexit, cuts and attacks on devolution against Scotland’s will. In its report the privileges committee says there is no precedent of a prime minister being found to have deliberately misled the Commons, as Boris Johnson is found to have done. It says: We have concluded above that in deliberately misleading the house Mr Johnson committed a serious contempt. The contempt was all the more serious because it was committed by the prime minister, the most senior member of the government. There is no precedent for a prime minister having been found to have deliberately misled the house. He misled the house on an issue of the greatest importance to the house and to the public, and did so repeatedly. He declined our invitation to reconsider his assertions that what he said to the house was truthful. His defence to the allegation that he misled was an ex post facto justification and no more than an artifice. He misled the committee in the presentation of his evidence. A reader asks: Is 90 days’ suspension unprecedented? Almost, but not quite. If Boris Johnson were still an MP, and if he were suspended for 90 days, it would be the second longest suspension since 1979. The only one longer was the six-month suspension imposed on Keith Vaz in 2019 for offering to buy drugs for sex workers and failing to cooperate with an investigation. This Commons library note includes a table setting out all the suspensions imposed on MPs since 1979. UPDATE: Two other MPs have faced suspensions of six months or more, but resigned instead. See 10.51am for more details. The Liberal Democrats are calling for Boris Johnson to be stripped of the £115,000 annual allowance paid to all former prime ministers in the light of today’s report. In a statement, Daisy Cooper, the Lib Dem deputy leader, says: This damning report should be the final nail in the coffin for Boris Johnson’s political career. It is completely unprecedented for a former prime minister to be found to have been a law-breaker and serial liar, who treated the public and parliament with total disdain. Rishi Sunak must cut off Johnson’s ex-prime minister allowance to stop him milking the public purse for his own personal gain. Anything less would be an insult to bereaved families who suffered while Boris Johnson lied and partied. Boris Johnson’s team is now circulating a six-point analysis purportedly explaining why the privileges committee report is flawed. It does not seem to be available online, so, for the record, here it is. 1) This is a kangaroo court. The committee has been a kangaroo court from the outset and, as Lord Pannick KC has repeatedly pointed out, it has acted as judge and jury in its own case in a way that is contrary to all legal practice. 2) The committee has contradicted the police’s own findings – setting itself above the law. The committee has been so desperate to convict Boris Johnson that it has now said that all workplace events – thank yous and birthdays and motivational meetings – were illegal. That is insane, and has no basis in the law. The committee’s view is contradicted by what the Metropolitan police themselves found – the police said that Boris Johnson did not break the rules by attending the farewell events. 3) The committee claims to know exactly what Boris saw at certain times and dates despite there being no evidence for this – as if the committee were inside his head. It has been driven to claim that it knows what Boris Johnson saw with his own eyes, and that he “must have known” that the event on December 18 2020 was illegal because he “must have seen it” as he went up the stairs to his flat. This is just crazy. The committee has no idea what was going on or what Boris Johnson saw. In fact, he saw nothing that struck him as being remotely untoward. The committee is just making things up. 4) If Boris Johnson must have known this was illegal, others did too – the committee’s logic is that dozens of other figures also knew. The committee’s entire argument is that Boris Johnson “must have known” that events were illegal. This is rubbish. If Boris Johnson must have known, then what about Rishi Sunak, Simon Case, Sue Gray and all the other senior figures who were roving the corridors of Downing Street? Why didn’t they know? 5) The report uses sleight of hand by mischaracterising Boris’s statements. The committee continually twists what Boris Johnson said in the house, claiming that he was offering general comments when he was in fact talking about specific events. 6) How is this process fair – especially given allegations that committee members were at rule-breaking events? If all thank-yous and birthdays were illegal, then how does Sir Bernard Jenkin justify his attendance at his wife’s birthday party, where the rules seem plainly to have been broken? In paragraph 95, on page 31 of the report, the privileges committee says that in May the government gave it new evidence relating to 16 events at Chequers or No 10 where lockdown rules may have been broken. This information came from Boris Johnson’s diaries, which were being reviewed by lawyers preparing material for the Covid inquiry. The committee says it was told the entries were “problematic” and that this was “based on an assessment by Government Legal Department as to events\/activities which could reasonably be considered to constitute breaches of Covid Regulations”. The committee says it asked Johnson about these events. Johnson’s lawyers said: Each event was lawful for one or more of the following reasons: the gathering was reasonably necessary for work purposes; the gathering took place outside; the rule of six applied at the time; the linked household provisions applied; the linked childcare provisions applied; and\/or emergency assistance and\/or care\/assistance was being provided to a vulnerable (pregnant) person. The committee says it has no evidence to disprove this, and that it decided not to investigate futher. But it says that, if it were to turn out that Johnson’s explanations were not true, then he might have committed a further contempt. Mr Johnson has provided, under a statement of truth, explanations of the 16 events referred to in the recent material submitted to us by the Government. We have no evidence conflicting with his account. We do not wish to incur the further delay to our inquiry that would result from a detailed investigation of these events, and therefore we treat Mr Johnson’s explanations as prima facie true. If for any reasons it subsequently emerges that Mr Johnson’s explanations are not true, then he may have committed a further contempt. Boris Johnson has issued a 1,700-word rebuttal to the committee. It reads more like a Telegraph column than a legal document, and it amounts to a wholesale, and bitterly angry, rejection of what the committee is saying. Here are some of the key points. Johnson says the report is “a charade”, and that some of its arguments are “a load of complete tripe”. He says: I believed that we were working, and we were: talking for the main about nothing except work, mainly covid. Why would I have set out, in the Chamber, to conceal my knowledge of something illicit, if that account could be so readily contradicted by others? Why would we have had an official photographer if we believed we were breaking the law? We didn’t believe that what we were doing was wrong, and after a year of work the Privileges Committee has found not a shred of evidence that we did. Their argument can be boiled down to: ‘Look at this picture – that’s Boris Johnson with a glass in his hand. He must have known that the event was illegal. Therefore he lied.” That is a load of complete tripe. That picture was me, in my place of work, trying to encourage and thank my officials in a way that I believed was crucial for the government and for the country as a whole, and in a way which I believed to be wholly within the rules … This report is a charade. I was wrong to believe in the Committee or its good faith. The terrible truth is that it is not I who has twisted the truth to suit my purposes. It is Harriet Harman and her Committee. He says that the publication of the report is “a dreadful day for democracy” and that it is part of a “protracted political assassination”. He says: This is a dreadful day for MPs and for democracy. This decision means that no MP is free from vendetta, or expulsion on trumped up charges by a tiny minority who want to see him or her gone from the Commons. I do not have the slightest contempt for parliament, or for the important work that should be done by the Privileges Committee. But for the Privileges Committee to use its prerogatives in this anti-democratic way, to bring about what is intended to be the final knife-thrust in a protracted political assassination – that is beneath contempt. He says that he genuinely believed that leaving events he attended at Downing Street were justified under the Covid rules. The committee says he ignored the fact that social distancing rules were not being followed, and that, when he claimed in-person leaving dos were allowed at the time, he was in effect rewriting the rules after the event. (See 9.13am.) Johnson claims this is wrong. He says: I knew exactly what events I had attended in Number 10. I knew what I had seen, with my own eyes, and like the current PM, I believed that these events were lawful. I believed that my participation was lawful, and required by my job; and that is indeed the implication of the exhaustive police inquiry. The only exception is the June 19 2020 event, the so-called birthday party, when I and the then Chancellor Rishi Sunak were fined in circumstances that I still find puzzling (I had lunch at my desk with people I worked with every day). So when on Dec 1 2021 I told the House of Commons that “the guidance was followed completely” (in Number Ten) I meant it. It wasn’t just what I thought: it’s what we all thought – that we were following the rules and following the guidance completely – notwithstanding the difficulties of maintaining social distancing at all times. The committee now says that I deliberately misled the House, and at the moment I spoke I was consciously concealing from the House my knowledge of illicit events. This is rubbish. It is a lie. In order to reach this deranged conclusion, the Committee is obliged to say a series of things that are patently absurd, or contradicted by the facts. He defends his belief that in-person work leaving dos were allowed during lockdown. He says: They say that I must have known that the farewell events I attended were not authorised workplace events because – wait for it – NO SUCH EVENT could lawfully have taken place, anywhere in this country, under the Committee’s interpretation of covid rules. This is transparently wrong. I believed, correctly, that these events were reasonably necessary for work purposes. We were managing a pandemic. We had hundreds of staff engaged in what was sometimes a round-the-clock struggle against covid. Their morale mattered for that fight. It was important for me to thank them. He accuses Sir Bernard Jenkin of rank hypocrisy. He says: The Committee cannot possibly believe the conclusions of their own report – because it has now emerged that Sir Bernard Jenkin attended at least one “birthday event”, on Dec 8 2020 – the birthday of his wife Anne – when it is alleged that alcohol and food were served and the numbers exceeded six indoors. Why was it illegal for me to thank staff and legal for Sir Bernard to attend his wife’s birthday party? The hypocrisy is rank. Like Harriet Harman, he should have recused himself from the inquiry, since he is plainly conflicted. He dismisses the committee’s suggestion that he must have known a party took place in the No 10 press office on 18 December 2020 because he walked past it. See paragraph 83, on page 28 of the report. Commenting on it, Johnson says: Perhaps the craziest assertion of all is the Committee’s Mystic Meg claim that I saw the Dec 18 event with my own eyes. They say, without any evidence whatever, that at 21.58pm, on that date, my eyes for one crucial second glanced over to the media room as I went up to the flat – and that I saw what I recognised as an unauthorised event in progress … First, the Committee has totally ignored the general testimony about that evening, which is that people were working throughout, even if some had been drinking at their desks. How on earth do these clairvoyants know exactly what was going on at 21.58 … It is a measure of the Committee’s desperation that they are trying incompetently and absurdly to tie me to an illicit event – with an argument so threadbare that it belongs in one of Bernard Jenkin’s nudist colonies. Their argument is that I saw this event, believed it to be illegal, and had it in my head when I spoke to the House. On all three counts they are talking out of the backs of their necks. If I did see an illegal event, and register it as illegal, then why was I on my own in this? Why not the Cabinet Secretary, or Sue Gray, or the then Chancellor, who was patrolling the same corridors at the time? Jenkin is, or at least in the past used to be, a naturist. The committee says, if Boris Johnson were still an MP, it would recommend a suspension for 90 days. It says that last week it was set to recommend a suspension for more than 10 sitting days, enough to trigger the recall election process. But it says it increased the hypothetical punishment in the light of his statement on Friday night, attacking the committee and its draft findings, which itself was “a very serious contempt”. Johnson is now an ex-MP, and so a suspension punishment can no longer apply. But the committee says Johnson should not be entitled the pass normally given to former MPs allowing them access to parliament. In its summary the committee says: The question which the house asked the committee is whether the house had been misled by Mr Johnson and, if so, whether that conduct amounted to contempt. It is for the house to decide whether it agrees with the committee. The house as a whole makes that decision. Motions arising from reports from this committee are debatable and amendable. The committee had provisionally concluded that Mr Johnson deliberately misled the house and should be sanctioned for it by being suspended for a period that would trigger the provisions of the Recall of MPs Act 2015. In light of Mr Johnson’s conduct in committing a further contempt on 9 June 2023, the committee now considers that if Mr Johnson were still a member he should be suspended from the service of the House for 90 days for repeated contempts and for seeking to undermine the parliamentary process, by: a) Deliberately misleading the house. b) Deliberately misleading the committee. c) Breaching confidence. d) Impugning the committee and thereby undermining the democratic process of the house. e) Being complicit in the campaign of abuse and attempted intimidation of the committee. We recommend that he should not be entitled to a former member’s pass. And this is what the committee says in its summary about why it thinks Boris Johnson deliberately misled MPs about Partygate. We considered the nature and extent of Mr Johnson’s culpability in misleading the house. In coming to the conclusion that Mr Johnson deliberately misled the house, we considered: a) His repeated and continuing denials of the facts, for example his refusal to accept that there were insufficient efforts to enforce social distancing at gatherings where a lack of social distancing is documented in official photographs, and that he neither saw nor heard anything to alert him to the breaches that occurred. b) The frequency with which he closed his mind to those facts and to what was obvious so that eventually the only conclusion that could be drawn was that he was deliberately closing his mind. c) The fact that he sought to rewrite the meaning of the rules and guidance to fit his own evidence, for example, his assertion that “imperfect” social distancing was perfectly acceptable when there were no mitigations in place rather than cancelling a gathering or holding it online, and his assertion that a leaving gathering or a gathering to boost morale was a lawful reason to hold a gathering. d) His own after-the-event rationalisations, for example the nature and extent of the assurances he received, the words used, the purpose of the assurances, who they came from, the warning he received about that from Martin Reynolds (his principal private secretary) and his failure to take advice from others whose advice would have been authoritative. His view about his own fixed-penalty notice (that he was baffled as to why he received it) is instructive. We came to the view that some of Mr Johnson’s denials and explanations were so disingenuous that they were by their very nature deliberate attempts to mislead the Committee and the house, while others demonstrated deliberation because of the frequency with which he closed his mind to the truth. This is what the report summary says about what the committee concluded. We established that Mr Johnson: a) had knowledge of the Covid rules and guidance. b) had knowledge of breaches of the rules and guidance that occurred in No 10. c) misled the house: i) when he said that guidance was followed completely in No 10, that the rules and guidance were followed at all times, that events in No 10 were within the rules and guidance, and that the rules and guidance had been followed at all times when he was present at gatherings. ii) when he failed to tell the house about his own knowledge of the gatherings where rules or guidance had been broken. iii) when he said that he relied on repeated assurances that the rules had not been broken. The assurances he received were not accurately represented by him to the house, nor were they appropriate to be cited to the house as an authoritative indication of No 10’s compliance with Covid restrictions. iv) when he gave the impression that there needed to be an investigation by Sue Gray before he could answer questions when he had personal knowledge that he did not reveal. v) when he purported to correct the record but instead continued to mislead the house and, by his continuing denials, this committee. d) was deliberately disingenuous when he tried to reinterpret his statements to the house to avoid their plain meaning and reframe the clear impression that he intended to give, namely i) when he advanced unsustainable interpretations of the rules and guidance to advance the argument that the lack of social distancing at gatherings was permissible within the exceptions which allowed for gatherings, and ii) when he advanced legally impermissible reasons to justify the gatherings. The Commons privileges committee report in Boris Johnson has now been published. It is here. There are not a lot of Tory MPs willing to publicly defend Boris Johnson any more, but one of them is Sir Michael Fabricant, and on the Today programme he gave an interview suggesting the privileges committee was biased against Johnson. Asked if he trusted parliament to judge Johnson, Fabricant replied: I trust parliament but of course I’m not so sure that I trust the privileges committee. Why do I say that? I actually sat in while Boris Johnson gave evidence. Now, you’ve got to understand that the committee sits in a quasi-judicial role. It’s there to dispassionately make a judgment. I looked at the members of the committee. Some of them behaved in a totally proper way. Others were pulling faces, were looking heavenwards, were indicating they didn’t agree with what Boris was saying. You know, I was quite shocked actually by the behaviour of some of the members of the privileges committee. On the subject of bias, Fabricant was then asked by the presenter, Nick Robinson, if he thought there was a link between his willingness to repeatedly defend Johnson and the fact that Johnson ensured he got a knighthood in the resignation honours published last week. Fabricant said he thought this topic would come up. But, in his reply, he implied that the knighthood was nothing to do with his pro-Johnson media appearances. He told Robinson: You know, I’ve served the people of Lichfield for 31 years. I’ve been on the government or opposition front benches for about nine years. I helped save, when there was an issue over tax, the National Memorial Arboretum. I helped move HS2 from going by a housing estate. A number of people have said that they are surprised it took so long. The Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, who chairs the Commons defence committee, has criticised Boris Johnson for the way he attacked Sir Bernard Jenkin, a Conservative member of the privileges committee, last night. Ellwood said that if Johnson had complaints about the process, he should have stayed on as an MP, and made a statement in the chamber, instead of resigning. Ellwood told Sky News: If Boris Johnson is unhappy with the committee’s findings, or indeed anybody on the committee, the personalities and so forth, he could easily have made a personal statement in the Commons – that’s the process – and presented his arguments prior to a full vote from the house, because it will be for the house to determine whether they support this publication or not. He’s chosen to abandon all those possible avenues of approach and quit parliament in its entirety. Now coming late in the day and saying ‘I’m unhappy with this individual’, this isn’t the process of somebody I believe is going to win the argument. Ellwood also said he hoped the Johnson “pantomime” would soon end. He said: Johnson’s confidence stemmed from the huge support he received from the party base. He was loved by members across the country but this is changing before our very eyes. There’s now disappointment, even anger that the party, the activists are left to pick up the pieces … The longer this public pantomime drags on, the more Boris loses support from a once very loyal base … the more the prime minister’s plans and vision which was starting to gain traction are overshadowed, the public actually want us to get back to politics. Rishi Sunak was on visit in Harrow this morning, where he witnessed an immigration raid. Asked about the privileges committee report into Boris Johnson, he said he had not seen it yet and that it would not be right to comment. Asked if he would give an interview later, after he had had time to read it, Sunak replied: You are talking about a report that I haven’t seen and that no one else has seen. It wouldn’t be right to comment on it in advance of it coming out and being published. These are matters for the House of Commons, and parliament will deal with it in the normal way that it does. The reference to parliament dealing with this report “in the normal way that it does” suggests that ITV’s Robert Peston was right yesterday when he said that the government will table a motion asking the Commons to approve the privileges committee report, and that a plan to instead have a debate on a motion just saying the Commons has noted the report has been dropped. Sunak was also asked if he was “frustrated” by Johnson’s interventions in the past week. He replied: No, I’m just getting on with delivering for the country. Good morning. In a post on his Substack blog last year Dominic Cummings, who was Boris Johnson’s chief adviser in No 10 and the strategist who did as much as anyone to help him win the 2019 general election, before he resigned and devoted his efforts to bringing Johnson down, wrote this about Johnson’s relationship with the truth. He rewrites reality in his mind afresh according to the moment’s demands. He lies – so blatantly, so naturally, so regularly – that there is no real distinction possible with him, as there is with normal people, between truth and lies. He always tells people what they want to hear and he never means it. He always says: ‘I can’t remember’ when they remind him and is rarely ‘lying’. Johnson misled MPs when he told them that the Covid rules and guidelines were followed in No 10 at all times. But last year, as the Partygate scandal was engulfing his administration and before he stood down, the Commons voted to get the privileges committee to conduct an investigation into whether he had done this deliberately (ie, lied), or at least recklessly. Today we will get its report. Advance stories suggest the verdict will be grim. Yesterday the Times said the privileges committee would conclude that Johnson “deliberately misled parliament over the Downing Street parties scandal”. This morning the Financial Times says it will say he “committed ‘multiple’ contempts of parliament”. We’ll be able to read it for ourselves very soon, because it is due out at about 9am. Because of the role he played in Brexit (many people think the leave campaign would have lost if he had not been leading it), Johnson has been one of the most consequential prime ministers of the modern era. Today’s report will significantly shape how he is remembered. As Aubrey Allegretti reports, last night Johnson launched a fierce attack on one of the committee’s Tory members, accusing him in effect of hypocrisy. Today we will be focusing almost exclusively on the report, and reaction to it. It is due out soon and later, during business questions in the Commons after 10.30am, Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, is expected to give details of when MPs will debate the report.

      "politics\/live\/2023\/jun\/12\/michael-gove-privileges-committee-boris-johnson-parliament-rishi-sunak-latest-politics-updates Boris Johnson has formally stepped down as an MP, parliamentary authorities have announced, bringing down the curtain on a tumultuous second stint in the Commons. The news came towards the end of a day during which Johnson and Rishi Sunak engaged in an extraordinary war of words over the former prime minister’s failed attempts to elevate several close allies to the House of Lords. The SNP has claimed that new regulations giving the police new powers to stop protesters (see 5.44pm) are a move in the direction of fascism. Opening the debate, Suella Braverman, the home secretary, said the police did need more powers to deal with disruptive protests. She said: People have a right to get to work on time free from obstruction, a right to enjoy sporting events without interruption and a right to get to hospital. The roads belong to the British people, not a selfish minority who treat them like their personal property. The impact of these disruptors is huge. Over the last six weeks alone, Just Stop Oil (JSO) carried out 156 slow marches around London. This has required over 13,770 police officer shifts, that’s over 13,000 police shifts that could have been stopping robbery, violent crime or anti-social behaviour, and the cost to the taxpayer is an outrage – £4.5 million in just six weeks on top of the £14 million spent last year. But Alison Thewliss, the SNP’s home affairs spokesperson, said the new law took the government in the direction of fascism. My colleague Ben Quinn has the quote. Humza Yousaf has rejected growing calls from across the political spectrum to suspend Nicola Sturgeon from the Scottish National party after her arrest on Sunday. Scrapping single-word gradings for schools would not alleviate the “underlying discomfort” teachers feel, Ofsted’s chief inspector has said, as she came under increasing pressure to reform the system after a headteacher’s suicide. In the Commons MPs are debating the Public Order Act 1986 (serious disruption to the life of the community) regulations 2023. These are new rules that lower the threshold for what counts as serious disruption when the police have to judge whether they have the powers to intervene to stop a protest. They also allow the police to consider the cumulative effect of a protest when deciding whether campaigners are causing serious disruption. This measure is particular designed to stop slow-walking protests organised by groups like Just Stop Oil. These measures are particularly controversial because they were originally meant to be primary legislation – part of the text of the Public Order Act – but they were voted down by peers. Because the amendments were introduced when the bill was in the Lords, not the Commons, they could not be reintroduced when the bill went back to MPs. The Lords secondary legislation scrutiny committee raised concerns about this in a report published last month. Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, a member of the committee, said: “As far as we can ascertain, this is the first time a government has sought to make changes to the law by making those changes through secondary legislation even though those same changes had been rejected by parliament when introduced a short while before in primary legislation.” Secondary legislation receives less scrutiny than primary legislation, it cannot be amended, and it is almost impossible to block. Opening the debate in the Commons, Suella Braverman, the home secretary, said the government supported the right to protest, but that she was responding to police requests for greater powers. The Treasury has released two statements confirming that Boris Johnson and Nigel Adams are now longer MP. Here they are: The chancellor of the exchequer has this day appointed Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson to be steward and bailiff of the Three Hundreds of Chiltern. The chancellor of the exchequer has this day appointed Nigel Adams to be steward and bailiff of the Manor of Northstead. Both press releases consisted of just a single sentence, and neither of them explained what this process actually means. See 11.56am for an explanation. People who attack institutions including parliament need to be “called out,” Penny Mordaunt has told a conference in London, where she also railed against those waging “culture wars.” Without specifically naming Boris Johnson or allies who have criticised the privileges committee investigation and its findings against the former prime minister, Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, said that politics was a team game but “quite often some people forget they are part of a team”. Speaking at an even organised by the Centre for Policy Studies, she said that she would be going to the House of Commons where there would be a debate on standards “and all sorts of things that have been in the news,” adding: We have to be really strong about calling out people out who are attacking institutions. People who are attacking the house for carrying out its work. This included those who were attacking the media, she said, adding: I never thought I would be defending the BBC. We have to stand up for these things because the price of not doing so is going to be very grave indeed. Later, in a discussion which touched on Donald Trump and populism elsewhere, she said that she wanted to say something “which applies to my colleagues in the Conservative Party today”. She went on: We have to have the strength not to be pulled in particular directions by particular media groups or pander to particular constituencies. We have to have a real sense with what we are about. Mordaunt, who has been seen as a potential standard-bearer for the centrist wing of the Conservative party in a future leadership battle, also said she was “amazed” at the continuation of a “failed model of leadership at the top” revolving around one figure rather than “the team”. I said to the PM: ‘Your team is the nation.’ That is why the culture wars and all that doesn’t help. We are here for everyone. That is why I am unapologetic about talking about building more and taxing less and not talking about culture wars, because it doesn’t move the country forward. Here is a question from a reader, prompted by the earlier post about the mechanism whereby MPs resign. If there are only two posts MPs can apply for if they want to resign, does that mean you can’t have three MPs resigning at the same time? No. There is no minimum time period under which people can serve as crown steward and bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds, or crown steward and bailiff of the Manor of Northstead, and as soon as a new one is appointed, the old one lapses. The Treasury tends to alternate; one “post” goes to one resigning MP, and the next MP to quit gets the other one. Eight unionists MPs got the Chiltern Hundreds job in a single day in 1985, when there were mass resignations to force byelections over the Anglo-Irish agreement. Another seven unionists got the Manor of Northstead job on the same day. Boris Johnson has now formally submitted his resignation as an MP, John Stevens from the Mirror reports. His resignation does not take effect until we get an announcement from the Treasury saying he has been appointed to an office of profit under the crown. (See 11.56am.) And Nigel Adams has done the same, Lucy Fisher from the FT reports. Downing Street has chosen not to escalate its war of words with Boris Johnson. After Johnson said this afternoon Rishi Sunak was talking “rubbish”, after Sunak said this morning Johnson tried to get him to do something improper with his resignation honours, the PM’s spokesperson was asked at the afternoon lobby briefing if he had a response. The spokesperson defended Sunak, summarising what he said earlier, but did not criticise Johnson directly. He said: You’ve got the words from the PM this morning. I’m not going to get into more detail. He was very clear he was not prepared to deviate from established convention or do anything unprecedented, which is why, in line with a long-standing custom, he forwarded the list unaltered. The line that Sunak was acting in line with “established convention” does rather undermine the claim he made this morning, when talking about this topic, that he wanted “to do things differently” because he wanted “to change politics”. (See 9.53am.) Sunak probably just meant he wanted to do things differently from Johnson. For anyone who likes their political history neatly arranged, it is fitting that Boris Johnson may be ending his parliamentary life (although his resignation has not been confirmed yet) on the day of Silvio Berlusconi’s death. The former Italian PM was a prototype for the populist, norm-trouncing, egotistical, performance politics now represented by Donald Trump and Johnson. Berlusconi was probably at his most powerful in the early years of the noughties, when Johnson was editor of the Spectator. Johnson went to interview him in 2003, with Nicholas Farrell. At the time received opinion in London was that Berlusconi was too corrupt to be a respectable European political leader. But Johnson recognised a kindred spirit, and filed a glowing tribute. Here’s an extract. It is hard not to be charmed by a man who takes such an interest in cacti and who will crack jokes at important EU gatherings, not only about Nazi camp commandants but also about whether or not his wife is running off with someone else. There is something heroic about his style, something hilariously imperial – from the huge swimming pool he has created by flooding a basin in the Sardinian hills, to the four thalassotherapy pools he has sunk for Veronica, powered by computers more advanced than those used on the moon shots … Suddenly, after decades in which Italian politics was in thrall to a procession of gloomy, portentous, jargon-laden partitocrats, there appeared this influorescence of American gung-hoery. Yes, he may have been involved in questionable business practices; he may even yet be found out and pay the price. For the time being, though, it seems reasonable to let him get on with his programme. He may fail. But then, of course — and this is the point that someone should write in block capitals, fold up and stuff in the mouth of Anna Lindh, Swedish foreign minister — he can be rejected by the Italian people. She may not like it but he was democratically elected and can be removed by the very people Anna Lindh insults. If we are obliged to compare Silvio Berlusconi with Anna Lindh, and other bossy, high-taxing European politicians. I agree with Farrell: as the narrator says of Jay Gatsby, a man Berlusconi to some extent resembles, he is ‘better than the whole damn lot of them’. UPDATE: Anna Lindh was stabbed to death very soon after the Johnson\/Farrell article was published by a man who claimed to be hearing voices in his head. Sir Jake Berry, Conservative party chair when Liz Truss was PM and one of Boris Johnson’s main supporters early in his leadership, posted a message on Twitter at the weekend saying Johnson had been forced out by the establishment “blob”. Asked today to defend his claim, Berry said people could look at the facts themselves. He told broadcasters: The establishment tried to block [Brexit]. I stand by that. That was definitely my experience working in Theresa May’s government. And the establishment has seen Boris out of the door. I think if people look at the facts, they either will or won’t agree with me. But Berry would not go as far as calling for Johnson to return as an MP. Asked if he would like to see him back in the Commons, Berry replied: Boris Johnson is a fantastic Conservative, a brilliant parliamentarian and appeals to the great British public in a way that I’ve never really seen any other politician do. I think there is just something special about him. He is an extraordinary character. But, that said, I absolutely know and believe that under the leadership of Rishi Sunak, by pursuing bold, Conservative values, we can secure that general election. Would-be insurgent parties of the right, Reform UK and Reclaim, have announced a pact for the upcoming byelections in which they will allow each other a free one in the contests. Reclaim’s leader and founder, Laurence Fox, will stand in Boris Johnson’s seat of Uxbridge while Dave Holland, managing director of an IT marketing company, will stand in Mid Bedfordshire, which is being vacated by Nadine Dorries. Richard Tice, the leader of Reform UK, said: This cooperation enables us to have extra focus on specific byelections. Many people feel totally let down by the two main parties that are both variants of socialism: high tax, nanny state, low growth and open borders. We stand for low tax, high growth and net zero immigration. My colleague Pippa Crerar says the Boris Johnson camp seem to have changed their story a bit over the past few days. Boris Johnson’s comment today (see 2.48am) about his resignation honours, and his dispute with Rishi Sunak, suggests that what he actually wanted was two resignation honours lists. Given his cakeist philosophy on life (“my policy on cake is pro having it and pro eating it”), this would be characteristic. What seems likely to have happened is that Nadine Dorries, Nigel Adams, Alok Sharma and probably Alister Jack, were on the list of names that went to the House of Lords appointments commission (Holac) – but that they were not approved because they would not agree to resign as MPs when their peerages were announced. If so, they would account for four of the eight names that were refused. Johnson is now implying that at some point in the future their names should have been resubmitted to Holac, not for a new reappraisal from scratch, but for revetting just on the resigning from the Commons issue. At that point the appointments might have gone through. Asking for a rethink was how Johnson got the Evgeny Lebedev peerage approved. The implication is that we might have had two Johnson honours list – the version out on Friday, and a second edition, or series two, much closer to the election, when the peerages might not have triggered byelections. Alternatively, Johnson was hoping that Sunak would promise to include his names on a subsequent honours list. A PM can announce peerages whenever they want, and there is normally a dissolution honours list at the end of the parliament. These names would have been in effect “Johnson honours part 2”, although perhaps not badged as such. Boris Johnson has accused Rishi Sunak of talking “rubbish” about his resignation honours list. In a statement he said: Rishi Sunak is talking rubbish. To honour these peerages it was not necessary to overrule Holac – but simply to ask them to renew their vetting, which was a mere formality. Gillian Keegan, the education secretary, has told the audience at a Margaret Thatcher-themed conference that the Conservatives are “not tribal” on a day when Rishi Sunak hit back at Boris Johnson over the former prime minister’s resignation honours list. In speech that was seen by some as setting out future leadership credentials, Keegan likened herself to the grocer’s daughter Thatcher while growing up as “a young working class girl” in Knowsley. She learned the value of “common sense” while working in a shop and saw “militant” trade unions “wreck” the Liverpool in which she grew up, said Keegan. But the minister, regarded as being part of the one nation tradition of Tory MPs, also took a thinly veiled swipe at the economics of Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng, stressing the need to deal with inflation before cutting taxes. Addressing the Centre for Policy Studies’ Margaret Thatcher Conference, she said: Whilst lower taxes are at the heart of Conservative economic thinking, Margaret Thatcher never thought that the way to achieve a low-tax economy was by dramatically increasing public sector debt and borrowing. She knew that you had to deal with inflation first otherwise every tax cut or spending pledge would be eaten by inflation. That focus, that grip, that is what this government is channelling. You can see it in the chancellor’s focus on restoring economic stability, and in the prime minister’s focus on driving areas where we can leverage a real competitive advantage. Speaking about her upbringing in Liverpool, where she left school at 16, she said she became disillusioned with politics while an apprentice at a car factory. “Militant trade unions downed tools at the drop of a hat,” she said. She voted for Thatcher at the age of 19. When she did initially stand as a Tory candidate – describing herself as an outlier – Keegan said she had changed her name to her husband’s “to protect the innocent”. Lord Marland, a Tory peer, former Conservative party chair and a supporter of Boris Johnson, has restated the Johnsonite claim that Rishi Sunak was to blame for blocking some of the former PM’s resignation honours peerages. No 10 denies this. In a statement the PM’s press secretary said: As is convention, the prime minister forwarded the former prime minister’s peerage list to Holac [the House of Lords appointments commission] unaltered. Holac then passed back their approved list. The prime minister then accepted Holac’s approved list and forwarded it unamended to the sovereign for their approval. He had no involvement or input into the approved list. It is a point of fact that it is made public by the commission if a prime minister overrules the commission’s advice. But, in an interview on the World at One, Marland said there were “eight people who Rishi decided not to support” for peerages. When it was put to him that Holac has said it removed the names, Marland replied: No, they didn’t. They had the names removed on the suggestion of elements of the civil service, the Cabinet Office or the Inland Revenue [as is] often the case, and then Holac don’t have to adjudicate. Marland also said Sunak could have ensured that Nadine Dorries, Nigel Adams and Alok Sharma, three of Johnson’s nominees, got peerages if he wanted to. He said: It is in the remit of the prime minister that, if he really wants someone to become a peer, he can push hard for Holac to do it, as various prime ministers have done in the past. Marland is right to say that in the past prime ministers have got people into the House of Lords in the face of opposition from Holac. But the best example of a PM doing this is Johnson himself, and these appointments caused huge controversy. He put Peter Cruddas in the Lords despite Holac saying the appointment was unsuitable. (Cruddas is now leading a Tory group that in effect is pushing for Johnson to return as leader.) Johnson also successfully urged Holac to think again after it initially raised concerns about his plan to give a peerage to Evgeny Lebedev, the newspaper owner and son of a former KGB officer. Holac has not named the eight people who were not approved for peerages on Johnson’s list and it says it won’t discuss individuals. Humza Yousaf, Scotland’s first minister, has said he will not suspend his predecessor Nicola Sturgeon from the SNP following her arrest yesterday as part of an investigation into financial misconduct by the party. She was released without charge. Yousaf said Sturgeon’s arrest was “personally painful”. He said: I’ll not suspend Nicola’s membership. I’ll treat her in the same way I’ve treated, for example, Colin Beattie. Those that have been released without charge, I see no reason to suspend their membership. Earlier Ash Regan, who came third in the recent SNP leadership contest, Sturgeon should voluntarily give up her SNP membership while the investigation into the party’s finances, and her role, continues. If Sturgeon did not do that, Yousaf should suspend her, Regan suggested. Severin Carrell and Libby Brooks have the story. A reader asks: When will The Tory Chief Whip be requesting a writ for the three by elections? What is the earliest date they can take place - middle of next month - assuming the motion is passed asap.? When is the likeliest date they will be taking place ? The party whose seat is vacant gets to move the writ for the byelection. Parties at risk of losing normally hold them as quickly as possible, to prevent having lots of time to campaign, or delay for as long as possible. But if the government delays, the byelections will happen in the autumn, when they could be more disruptive. So they are likely to hold them as soon as they can. First, though, the three MPs have to formally resign. (See 11.56am.) That has not happened yet, but could happen later today. The chief whip for the party defending the seat has to move the writ for a byelection in the Commons. Once that happens, a byelection should take place between 21 and 27 days later. In her London Playbook briefing for Politico, Rosa Prince says Thursday 13 July could end up as the date for the three byelections. Downing Street has defended the Commons privileges committee after it was described as a “kangaroo court” by Boris Johnson in his resignation statement on Friday. Echoing what Michael Gove said in interviews this morning (see 9.19am), the PM’s spokesperson said: This is a properly set-up committee that the house has voted to carry out their work. The government will in no way traduce or criticise the work of the committee who are doing exactly what parliament has asked them to do. Kitty Donaldson from Bloomberg says multiple Tories are telling her that, if Boris Johnson spends the next year attacking Rishi Sunak, the party will partly blame him if it loses the next election. At the Downing Street lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson was asked about the claim from the Boris Johnson camp this morning (see 11.01am) that Rishi Sunak went back on a deal with Johnson over his resignation honours list. Asked if this was correct, the spokesperson said no. He also said Sunak had commented on this this morning. (See 9.53am.) The spokesperson also said the House of Lords appointments commission had issued a statement saying that eight of Johnson’s nominees were turned down. The spokesperson also said that, once Holac produced its list of approved nominations, the PM submitted that to the king without making any changes. He said: It is entirely untrue to say anyone from No 10 attempted to remove or change or alter Holac’s list. The spokesperson refused to comment on what Sunak and Johnson said when they met earlier this month to discuss the honours list. He said that he did not comment on private conversations, and that Sunak had commented on this this morning. More than 600 people crossed the English Channel in small boats on Sunday in the highest number on a single day so far this year, new figures show. Home Office data released on Monday shows that 616 people, the vast majority of whom will claim asylum, were detected passing this year’s previous high of 497 on Saturday 22 April. It means the number of crossings in 2023 now stands at a provisional total of 8,380, down from around 10,000 at the same point last year. The jump in numbers on Sunday follows a 21% per cent drop between January and May this year. Six days ago, Rishi Sunak claimed that government policies including threatening to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda and paying more money to the French authorities had “started to work”. Others claimed that the Channel had seen unusually windy weather during the Spring months. Despite the decline in numbers at the start of 2023, the biggest increase in the numbers arriving by small boats in 2022 happened during the summer months. This is typically when the weather is best for crossing the Channel. In total, the number who made the crossing last year reached a record 45,755, prompting Sunak to make tackling small boat crossings a priority for his Government this year. Twelve boats were detected crossing the Channel on Sunday, which suggests an average of around 51 people per boat. Boris Johnson, Nadine Dorries and Nigel Adams have all said that they are resigning as MPs. But, as Steven Swinford from the Times reports, they have yet to formally submit their resignations. Unlike normal employees, MPs cannot resign just by writing a letter saying they are resigning. In theory they are not allowed to resign, and so if they want to leave parliament, they have to accept an “office of profit under the crown”. That means they have to get appointed either as crown steward and bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds, or crown steward and bailiff of the Manor of Northstead. These used to be offices of profit, but now they involve no pay – and no other obligations either. The Treasury announces when these appointments have been made. Normally the chancellor signs it off as an MP writes to say they want to quit. A resignation only becomes operative once that appointment has been announced. I have corrected the post at 10.30am to take out a line wrongly saying the House of Lords appointments commission (Holac) had approved Nadine Dorries, Nigel Adams and Alok Sharma for peerages. It hadn’t. The EU has dashed UK hopes of an early review of the Brexit trade deal saying is unlikely to re-open talks until 2026. European commission vice-president Maroš Šefčovič, who leads for the EU on Brexit matters, said the deal was only in force for two years and it would be pointless re-opening it until its full potential was realised. The trade and cooperation agreement (the official title of the EU-UK free trade deal) says its implication can be reviewed from 2025, which had led to speculation a review might happen soon after the next general election. Šefčovič’s remarks come just weeks after Keir Starmer said Labour would seek an “improved” trade deal after Vauxhall’s parent company warned it might have to quit the UK unless part of the pact was tweaked. The House of Lords urged the UK government to start working with EU capitals to remove Brexit barriers that block musicians, young people and professionals working easily in Europe. “We have received quite a lot of questions and I’ve seen that there is increased interest in the TCA review. As far as our calendar goes, I think that it’s more for 2026,” Šefčovič told the EU-UK forum. And he warned that wholesale stripping out of decades of EU law risks putting the trade deal in “the shredder” creating more obstacles to cross-Channel trade not fewer. He said: If the decision is just to simply go for more divergence … some of the fundamentals of the withdrawal agreement and the TCA would be thrown into the shredder. An ally of Boris Johnson has accused Rishi Sunak of having “secretly” blocked peerages for Johnson’s allies, PA Media reports. Responding to Sunak’s comments this morning (see 9.53am), the ally told PA: Rishi secretly blocked the peerages for Nadine and others. He refused to ask for them to undergo basic checks that could have taken only a few weeks or even days. That is how he kept them off the list – without telling Boris Johnson. And here is some comment from journalists on Rishi Sunak’s condemnation of Boris Johnson. From Sky’s Rob Powell From the former Times political editor Philip Webster From Sky’s Tamara Cohen Keiran Pedley from Ipsos says Rishi Sunak is in a strong position to slap down Boris Johnson, because even people who voted Tory in 2019 think he would be a better PM than Johnson. In his morning interview round, speaking on behalf of the government, Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, adopted a relatively non-confrontational approach when discussing Boris Johnson. While suggesting it was now time for the Conservative party to move on from Johnson, he avoided multiple opportunities to criticise him directly. (See 9.19am.) In his London Tech Week Q&amp;A, Rishi Sunak went much further, accusing Johnson of trying to do something improper with the honours list. By the standard of what some people say about Johnson, the words may seem almost anodyne. (See 9.53am.) But for Sunak, this was strong stuff. Until now, he has been reluctant to say anything very critical of Johnson in public, conscious that for a significant minority of Tory party members (but a much smaller cohort of Tory MPs), Johnson remains an idol, and a potential saviour. Sunak’s comment also provides the first on-the-record confirmation as to what the Sunak\/Johnson rift over the honours list was all about. Johnson wanted to offer peerages to three MPs particularly close to him: Nadine Dorries, the former culture secretary and his most loyal public defender; Nigel Adams, the former minister who was Johnson’s key backroom fixer; and Alok Sharma, who worked as a junior minister for Johnson when Johnson was foreign secretary and who then chaired the Cop26 conference. (A fourth MP, Alister Jack, the Scottish secretary and a close friend of Johnson’s, was originally on the list too, but ruled himself out.) But it would not have been possible for the MPs to be named as peers on the resignation honours list but delay taking their seats in the Lords until around time time of the elections, to avoid byelections that would be damaging for the party. A minister confirmed this in the House of Lords in November last year. Today Sunak confirmed that Johnson wanted him to either over-ruled Holac on this issue, or to give a private assurance that if Dorries, Adams and Sharma were left off the list, they would get a peerage later. (A PM can nominate peers whenever they want.) That is why Dorries and Adams resigned out of pique. (Sharma has not resigned, and while it is hard to see Sunak giving peerages to Dorries or Adams, it is quite possible Sharma could get a peerage from Sunak in the dissolution honours, because his handling of Cop26 was widely admired.) But what remains unexplained is why Dorries, and perhaps Adams too, only realised that their hopes of going to the Lords were dashed at the end of last week. On Friday morning Dorries said that she would not be resigning as an MP. When she did resign a few hours later, she said it was because “something significant happened”, implying she had only just realised that Sunak was not promising her a peerage. Yet Sunak and Johnson met to discuss this seven days earlier. According to Tim Shipman’s account in the Sunday Times, Johnson told Dorries afterwards that her peerage was safe. Shipman says: After the meeting with Sunak, Johnson messaged Nadine Dorries to say: “Just finished the meeting with Rishi. List being published imminently. You’re on it.” When it finally dropped on Friday, it was shorn of peerages for Dorries, Adams and Sharma, as well as gongs for two Tory donors, David Ross and Stuart Marks. One explanation would be Sunak not being clear to Johnson at the meeting about his intentions. But in his report Shipman also says a Sunak aide took notes during the meeting, and those notes record Sunak telling Johnson: “I don’t want you to leave this room thinking I have made you a promise as that will be a problem in our relationship going forward.” The alternative explanation would be that Johnson told Dorries something about the outcome of his meeting with Sunak that was not true, and that she only found out on Friday afternoon. If so, she would not be the first person let down by a Johnson promise. UPDATE: I have amended the post to take out a line wrongly saying that Holac had approved Dorries, Adams and Sharma for peerages. It didn’t; they were not on the list of approved peers released by No 10 over the weekend. Here is the full quote from Rishi Sunak in his Q&amp;A on Boris Johnson and his honours list. When it comes to honours and Boris Johnson, Boris Johnson asked me to do something that I wasn’t prepared to do, because I didn’t think it was right. That was to either overrule the Holac [House of Lords appointments] committee or to make promises to people. Now, I wasn’t prepared to do that. As I said, I didn’t think it was right. And if people don’t like that, then tough. At that point there was a large round of applause. Sunak went on: When I got this job, I said I was going to do things differently because I wanted to change politics. And that’s what I’m doing. And I’m also keen to make sure that we change how our country works. And that’s what I’m here talking about today – making sure that we can grow our economy, that we can maintain our leadership in the innovative industries of the future. Why? Because it’s going to create jobs for people, it’s going to spread opportunity around. And it has the potential, as we’ve been discussing, to transform people’s lives. As prime minister, I want to make sure that that happens, because I want to make sure that I improve everyone’s lives in this country and do it in a way that is right and is in accordance with my values. And that’s what I’m going to keep doing. There was another round of applause when he ended. At the London Tech Week event Rishi Sunak is now taking questions from journalists. Asked about Boris Johnson, he says Johnson asked him to do something that he was not prepared to do, because he “didn’t think it was right”. He says Johnson wanted him to either over-rule the House of Lords appointments commission, or to make promises (to the MPs offered peerages by Johnson, who wanted to delay their resignations until later, so as not to cause byelections). This is the first on-the-record explanation we have had from Sunak about the rift with Johnson over the honours list. There is a round of applause for Sunak when he says this. (This is highly unusual in a Q&amp;A like this.) UPDATE: See 9.53am for the full quote. Sunak is now taking questions at the London Tech Week. He is in a Q&amp;A with Demis Hassabis from Google’s DeepMind. He says the UK was at the forefront of inventions during the industrial revolution. Going forward, he says regulation is key; you need a balance between regulation that supports innovation but also puts appropriate protections in place. “The UK has a track record of getting that balance right,” he says. And he says creative industries will be an important component of tech in the future. He says that is another areas where the UK is strong. This is from Sky’s Rob Powell. Rishi Sunak is speaking at London Tech Week. In his opening remarks, he said the tech world was changing very quickly, and that the government could not afford to rest if it wanted to exploit the opportunities available. The UK was the third country in the world for unicorns (tech start-ups worth $1bn), he said. It was third in the world behind the US and China. Sunak also said the UK was the best country in the Europe for raising capital for tech. He went on: What’s the single most important reason innovators like you should choose this country? The answer is leadership. Do you trust the people in charge to really get what you’re trying to do With this government, and with me as your prime minister, you can judge us not by our words, but our actions. It’s this government that’s building the most pro-investment tax regime, that’s increasing public R&amp;D investment to record levels, that’s making our visa system for international talent one of the most competitive in the world, but overhauling our listing rules to make it easier for companies to raise public funding and changing our pension rules to unlock new private capital. Sunak said AI offered great opportunities. But it had to be developed in a way that was safe, he said, and he highlighted three government initiatives to achieve this. First, he said the government was working with companies to ensure they give early access to their models, so they can be evaluated. Second, the UK will host an international conference on AI regulation, he said. And, third, he said the government was investing in AI to ensure that it could be used to benefit public services. Good morning. At the end of last week Boris Johnson, and two of his most loyal supporters, resigned their Commons seats, unexpectedly and without any need to do so, triggering byelections that could destabilise Rishi Sunak’s government. Nadine Dorries and Nigel Adams offered no proper explanation for what they were doing, and Johnson (wrongly) claimed that he was being forced out because the privileges committee is due to publish a report saying he misled parliament. (He could have stayed in the Commons to defend himself, and only losing a recall election would have forced him out for good.) Johnson’s resignation statement attacked the privileges committee, but the three resignations were also an implicit declaration of war against Sunak by a former PM whose only hope of returning to the political frontline rests on Sunak losing the next election. In this situation, what does Sunak do? Go on the offensive and seek to marginalise Johnson even more? Or calm things down, avoid antagonising the Johnson faction even further, and hope that mainstream party opinion will unite behind the leadership. Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, has been giving interviews on behalf of the government this morning, and he made it clear that No 10 is adopting the latter strategy. Here are some of his messages. Gove defended the Commons privileges committee, and condemned the fact that criticism of the committee means that its members have now been offered extra security. He told the Today programme: The people who served on that committee were asked by the House of Commons collectively to do a particular job. It’s a job that has required careful work on their part and no little effort to make a series of significant judgments. So I have respect for the work that they have done. And I think that we need to respect again the integrity of the process, and wait until the report is published before then debating its conclusions and the consequences. The second thing that I want to say is that I do deprecate the fact that they are now in a position where, as reported, they have to seek or have been granted additional security. As someone who’s been through that position myself in the past then I extend my sympathy to them and their families at this point. Gove did not explain why the MPs on the committee feel they are under threat. It is because Johnson has accused it of acting like a “kangaroo court”, and suggested that it is ruling against him as part of some shadowy establishment plot to undermine Brexit, and because some Tory MPs, notably Jacob Rees-Mogg, have said much the same. The committee is meeting this morning to finalise its report into Johnson. Gove played down the significance of the three byelections, saying the party would unite behind Sunak. He told BBC Breakfast: Elections are part of political life. It’s also the case I think that you do best in elections when you concentrate on good government. And we are united behind Rishi Sunak in making sure that we demonstrate that the priorities that the British public have are those which govern every waking moment that we have. Gove declined to criticise Johnson, Dorries or Adams explicitly. Asked repeatedly on the Today programme to acknowledge Johnson’s faults, he said he preferred to remember his achievements, and in another interview he refused to criticise Dorries or Adams for standing down. Gove dodged questions about whether he would like to see Johnson return to the Commons in the future, telling Times Radio: I’ve offered Boris advice in the past. He hasn’t always taken it. And so therefore, I think Boris will make his own mind up. Some Tories want Sunak to declare that Johnson cannot stand again as a candidate, while Johnson’s supporters are saying blocking him would be unacceptable. It is not surprising that No 10 currently seems to be sitting on the fence on this one. We should hear from Sunak on the topic of Johnson soon. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Rishi Sunak gives a speech on AI at the London Tech Week conference. Morning: The Commons privileges committee meets in private to discuss the final version of its report on claims Boris Johnson misled MPs about Partygate. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby conference. After 3.30pm: MPs debate Lords amendments to the retained EU law (revocation and reform) bill. Later there will be a debate on Public Order Act regulations, followed by a general debate on the principle of excluding MPs from the parliamentary estate if they are deemed a risk to staff because of accusations they face. 4pm: James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, gives evidence to the Commons foreign affairs committee on the integrated review. Also, Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, will be campaigning today in Mid Bedfordshire, ahead of the byelection caused by the resignation of Nadine Dorries.
