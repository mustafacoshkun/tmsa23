Text Mining and Sentiment Analysis
 
Definition
The course offers a thorough understanding of the latest methodologies in the area of text mining and sentiment analysis, including a brief introduction to related issues like emotion detection and opinion mining. The curriculum is divided into three primary sections. The initial module introduces fundamental concepts necessary for comprehending text processing, the basics of natural language processing, text classification, and topic modeling. The second module focuses on sentiment analysis within the context of opinion mining and covers rule-based and machine learning models, including statistical language models and neural networks, as well as emotion detection. In the third module, case studies are covered with interactive and flipped learning style. The course uses Python as a teaching language which will be introduced alongside the substantial content throughout the class.
 
Prerequisites
The course does not require any prior knowledge of text mining or related techniques but a good general quantitative background is expected. Similarly general programming background, for example in R, is assumed but no prior knowledge of Python is required.
 
Course Content

Goals and Objectives
After finishing the course students should be able to:

Know the basics of Python programming language
Use NLTK and SpaCy NLP modules
Execute and mine text data
Analyze and find sentiments in given text datasets
Be familiar with the current text mining and sentiment analysis literature and trending algorithms
 
Lecture Style
In the first 30-40 minutes of each lecture, theoretical background of the topic will be presented, then, a dataset will be examined using the algorithm of the week together as an exercise. During the exercises students will be asked to differentiate the idea in their own way. For instance, students would change the dynamics (parameters, lexicons, data structure) of execution to come up with unique results. After this personalization of the exercise, students will submit their results as homework. The submission due date for the homework is up until the next lecture for students.
There will be 4 or 5 assignments with this process. Students start in class and finish by personalizing at home.
Homework assignments should be finished individually, discussions with peers or instructor are allowed, but copying or any other type of cheating is strictly prohibited.

Moving to Lecture 10, students will start preparing their final projects. Detailed instructions will be delivered when the time will come. The project will require that the student will use all the necessary knowledge acquired during the course.
 
Textbooks
There is no official textbook for this course. Materials will be provided with lecture notes, power point slides and also from the internet. But the following books would be great reference and helpful for the course progress.

General Rules
Attendance is very important since we will have practical sessions and homework initializations in class, but it has no effect on the grade.
Regular and weekly course work, including assignments, is important for successful participation
Most of the weeks we will use computers during lectures. It is highly recommended to bring your laptops to lectures.
